What algorithm could automatically tell the difference?

It's not like it starts out as 2D and it slowly figures out what to pop out into 3D.  <br /><br />As for where sprites can go, bats, ghosts, player weapons, enemy projectiles, items, etc. move over solid wall blocks.  And, the player can jump upwards through blocks to climb; blocks only become solid again when you land.<br /><br />One possible explanation is that the emulator contains a tile table for all the common games, providing hints on how to display the tiles.

Shape recognition - like any recognition problem - is hard and does not have an ultimate answer. On Nes System fortunately we can choose color pattern as the main factor for shape clustering, it works for 90% case. It's still an open problem for improvement through. Consequently an 2D tile is not always mapping to an &quot;3D tile&quot;, for example an 2D solid tile can be used in the introduction cube at the begin of SMB, but also be used in grass or cloud. The corresponding 3d tile in each case is completely different. The original code only allowed one 2d tile to be mapped to one 3d tile. For the current code one 2d tile is technically allowed to be mapped to many 3d tile but still be mapped to only one 3d tile. That's why you see some small strange detail in grass, in pipe etc. I could tack it earlier of course, but it would affect greatly on emulation speed so instead i went for the missing aspect (light, shadow, adequate sound quality) first then performance re-optimization. Right now i'm ready to return to 3d convert problem.<br /></div><br /><br />Wow. That sounds pretty good. Only heuristics?. I've seen some videos and I think the result might improve if you apply some sort of machine learning algorithms although I understand that at this stage of development may be more convenient to improve the heuristics. In any case the result is impressive. I hope to see further progress soon.
