		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The point of the post is that I'm interested in hearing about what sort of techniques you might recommend to work with a document larger than 1280 bytes. I'm aware of the log-structured file system concept, but I was under the impression that that was intended more for occasionally saving individual documents than for using flash as essentially a swap file during an operation that might modify most of a large document. Should one expect to have to design an application around keeping the working copy in video memory, then reading back from video memory all the time, like in Videomation?<br /><br />I'm just not entirely certain that retrofitting Chase to allow its graphics to be edited is feasible <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=128451#p128451" class="postlink">by July 1</a>. Feel free to prove me wrong however.

If we want to fill the space, we may need to extend the deadline. Here's the map that my builder printed, showing five unused banks:<br /><br />Bank 0: Function, 2048<br />Bank 1: Auge, Sliding Blaster<br />Bank 2: Chase, Snail Maze Game<br />Bank 3: DABG<br />Bank 4: Love Story<br />Bank 5: MilioNESy<br />Bank 6: 8K entries<br />Bank 7: RHDE<br />Bank 8: Sir Ababol<br />Bank 9: Sgt. Helmet - Training Day<br />Bank 15: Menu<br /><br />And I'm feeling more and more hesitant to keep Snail Maze Game on the cart. Its music and maps are identical to those of the Sega Master System BIOS.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks. Now I've made a tool for semi-automatically combining 8K games into a 16K bank, based on my old tool for combining 16K games into a 32K bank that I wrote back when Action 53 was BNROM-based. I used this to make a Theremin/PCB Artist submulti, and it appears to be working correctly.<br /><br />Now the release is waiting on these:<br /><ul><li>Nova is working on Conway's Life and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FALSE" class="postlink">FALSE</a> interpreter. </li><li>USER sent source for The 1007 Bolts to NESHomebrew's email. It apparently uses some &quot;alien&quot; assembler syntax for which I plan to build a translator to ca65 the way I did for NESASM syntax when squeezing Munchie Attack into holes in LAN Master </li><li>Something else to fill about 4 more banks...? </li></ul>

FALSE shouldn't take very long to do since the editor is mostly done and the interpreter should be very easy to write.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can sort of see where you're coming from given the returning minigames in each <em>Mario Party</em>. But if we ship a bunch of reruns, we might end up having to do more than the four volumes that I had <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=11331" class="postlink">planned</a> in order to reach 53 quality games in a package that people are willing to pay $53 for. On the other hand, I guess I should plan for some games to get bigger during the remix compo. For example, RHDE will likely become a 48K to 64K game, and my artist is definitely going to give Concentration Room an overhaul to bring it up to at least 32K.

I could definitely come up with some fun changes for Thwaite having messed with the code already for my first hack of it.
