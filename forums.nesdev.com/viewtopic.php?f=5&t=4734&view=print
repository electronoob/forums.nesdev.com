<br />I was looking at my video's on youtube. I was one who made Youtube poop.
<br />Mine was never popular yet others would to highly similar crap and get millions of views. Also I'd get ripped off and those would get thousand of views.

<br />one of my favorites. Wasn't originally called youtube poop.
<br />But those get higher hits due to description.
<br />Man was I a n00b. 
<br />Especially since I have high flash experience. I even excel in actionscript. (Made some games in it like tetris.) I wonder why I'd submit these when I an capable of animation.
<br />
<br />here's a similar thing I made but it is an original animation.
<br />Well it's a remake but has unique animation.

<br />(Poor animation)
<br />
<br />The only thing I lack Is motivation.
<br />I think I'll even be less motivated since I'm staring school. But I am taking the related courses now. Aiming for a degree in applied science in computer graphics and programming. (I have took vocational courses in the past though)
<br />So since I'll be working this stuff maybe I'll submit my projects on the inteernet.
<br />BTW: Those vid's are OLD. Check the dates.

I don't know much about ActionScript, and I don't really plan to use it's scaling features, as I think by-hand scale can prove to be a lot better, especially if you scale three dimensionally (so something like a bird beak towards the camera would scale at a faster rate as it gets closer to the camera).
<br />
<br />I dream to one day make the most beautiful, but not serious, cartoon ever made, worthy of an Academy Award. Basically I'll use flash to paste stuff over backgrounds, but I'll pretty much animate everything else by myself.

Altough you'll have to find a tutorial for it because as-it it's almost impossible to know how to use the programm. I found a tutorial in french and I'm going to read it one day.
<br />
<br />PS : The first video has really great animation for a fan-based one ! It would be great if you would work on graphics for video games.

<br />
<br />Well, here's a good hints for NG animations.
<br />Use this for stopping a frame (Good for menu's):
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">stop&#40;&#41;;<br /></div><br />and use this for cleaning up the context menu:<br />(Get's rid of Those features like rewind and other bug causing crap)<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">var my_cm:ContextMenu = new ContextMenu&#40;&#41;;<br />my_cm.hideBuiltInItems&#40;&#41;;<br />this.menu = my_cm;<br /></div>
<br />I don't know if that's how it's usually done, but I just wrote it. Works perfect though.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />And by the red portion of the excerpt from your quote, are you talking about ease value?
<br /><strong>According to official flash documents ease value is:</strong>
<br />"About easing animations The default behavior of motion tweens is for the animation to proceed at the same speed throughout its entire duration. Often however, this doesn't look very good to the eye. Just as a car doesn't go from 0 to 50 mph instantly, your animations shouldn't either. Easing an animation is the same as accelerating a car slowly. The term easing comes from the idea that you ease a car into motion, or ease it to a stop. By adding an easing value, you cause your motion tweens to begin or end more gradually."
<br />So in a nutshell, Ease value is a motion that slows down or speed up towards the end..

<br />
<br />About scaling an object, well, imagine that you have a bird flying towards the camera. If you draw this bird by hand, it will be flat. If all you do to make this bird get bigger as it flies towards the camera is stretch the image, it may look okay, but if you scale 3 Dimensionally, where the beak of the bird scales at a faster rate as it gets really close to the camera, it will look really great. This you'd have to do by hand.

<br />Holy Crap! You could've just used gifs on a material flash drive or somthin'.
<br />
<br />Some times I do small 3d sequences, render each frame to it's own BMP, enhance each frame in photoshop, upload them to flash (Animation would be 12 FPS) and add text's menu's,sounds,  cheap effects from there.
<br />Man, I  should upload this awesome magnamite sequence I did. It was awseome. 
<br />Well G2G. I'll find it and upload it later. Or maybe just remake it.

<br />
<br />I won't upload my cartoon yet, because I partially don't want anyone to see it before it's complete, besides that it needs to be probably remade, and also I'm paranoid about people taking it and claiming it as their own. I highly doubt anyone here would take it, I just don't want to have it at all possible to happen that anyone anywhere would take it, so I'm pretty much 100% safe not uploading it.
<br />
<br />However, I will say that I do use both MS Paint and Photoshop. MS Paint is really great for standard functions like the line tool and curve tool. Photoshop lacks this. It's easy to import a paint project into Photoshop, however it SUCKS to import a Photoshop project into paint. Paint isn't set up to work with complex color fields like JPEG images. But otherwise, I use photoshop for lighting effects, and also it's wonderful color selection capabilities. This feature is handy when I trace over an image in paint with the curve tool set to some obscure color, and then I import that into photoshop and use color select to get the trace by itself.

<br />People who have learned the fundementals of PS would never go back to Paint. Paint is fixed to a setting of less than 72 PPI and  compared to PS, Paint is an Inferior excuse for a vector editor.
<br />Although graphic artists typically use Mac anyway, So they wouldn't have paint in their OS to begin with.
<br />
<br />Oh, a good safe way to upload a portion of animation is to use watermarks.
<br />Although those can be easily hidden, But recovered easily. It's safer to keep it a secret. Like rockstar with GTA: chinatown wars.
<br />Remember:

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I use Paint primarily because I'm familiar with it. I started animating when I first got a computer back in 2004. I guess it would be good to start using InkScape which I downloaded for my Graphic Design class about a year ago, but I used MS Paint instead. I like the idea of handles for vector graphics, but I've been able to whip up good designs with MS Paint's curve tool, which is actually really weird when you try and use it. But anyways, with MS Paint, or possibly some other program like InkScape, you can easily create the main outline of a picture, and then tweak it in photoshop. If you're making a picture of a sphere, it would probably be good to use the circle tool in Paint and copy/paste that over to photoshop.
<br />
<br />And yeah, I'm not getting a Mac (at least not now). Pretty much all software is designed for Windows, and then for Mac, kind of like a store will definitely sell regular Root Beer, and then perhaps Diet Root Beer. But I do remember using Mac's version of Paint in school about 6 years ago. It was nice that it had vector graphics and each file wasn't just a 2 dimensional matrix of colors, and pictures would print out looking really cool.
<br />
<br />That's actually not a bad idea about the watermarks. Though I'd probably like it to be like the watermarks for Corbis pictures. It was an obvious watermark, but you could still tell what was going on below it.

<br />Well the same is opposite for graphic arts applications. Also, The software is supported longer than windows. EG: Plugins, support 'n' crap.
<br />However this mostly applies to PS and flash.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />Here's an image I just threw together real quick. About ten minutes.
