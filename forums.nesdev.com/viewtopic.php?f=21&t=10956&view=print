		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looks good! Pretty interesting way to blend the grass with the ground. I wonder if it would look good in slopes. I see a few problems though:<br /><br />It seems you are using 3 palettes just for this basic scene: 1 for the grass (black + 3 greens), 1 for the ground (black + 3 browns) and 1 to connect the grass and the sky (black + 2 greens + cyan). That leaves only one palette left for everything else you might need to draw using the background. Also, since black is the background color, if you want to put something else in front of the sky (like mountains, rings, whatever) you'll have to waste one of the colors of this last palette with cyan, leaving only 2 colors to actually work with.<br /><br />Considering all of this, I think this setup might work for a demo or a couple of static screens, but wouldn't really work for a complete level in an actual game. In an actual game you'd probably have to go with 2-color grass and use cyan as the background color. Then you'll be able to use the browns for mountains and tree trunks and you'll still have 2 palettes left for other things. A palette with grays + white could be used for clouds, spikes and rocks, for example.

If you try to make slopes with your current palette setup it might end up looking blocky where the grass meets the ground, because you won't be able to draw the checkerboard pattern too close to the grass.

This should allow drawing slopes with the grass and top of dirt palette as a transition.

I didn't assume they'd look bad, I think it might actually work! There are a few NES games that have slopes using different palettes from the ground under them and the resulting blockiness isn't particularly distracting. It will definitely look blockier than the 16-bit version, but that isn't necessarily bad.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">...but I did it anyway <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div><br />Only without slopes, and without many colors left for the rest of the level elements (clouds, rocks, trees, spikes, rings, mountains, etc.). I don't know what your goal with this mockup is, but if you're trying to simulate an actual game, you're not being sensible about the palette usage. If you just want to make a couple of good looking static shots, then you can be as wasteful as you want! =)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The Master System can display more colors per tile than NES, but not quite as many as Genesis.</div><br />One Master System palette has as many colors as one Mega Drive palette, but the Master System only has 2 palettes while the Mega Drive has 4.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You might have better luck trying to emulate 8-bit Sonic.</div><br />If you want to see how the 16-bit Green Hill might look on the Master System, you may be interested in checking out Sonic’s Edusoft.<br /><br />EDIT: tepples, your gradient looks pretty good in this shot.

I believe the palettes are set up so that green and brown can't be in the same attribute area, so everything immediately below the grass must be black. I don't think it's very noticeable when the ground is straight as in this mock-up, but I did question how it would look on slopes, which would need far more black pixels.
