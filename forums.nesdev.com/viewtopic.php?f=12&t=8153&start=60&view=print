But I would prefer you not have to pay anything this time so I could just send you a paypal payment and send you back the chip after. You are a really generous person and i wish I could pay you back at some point by helping you with something.

<br />
<br />I tested the chip right away, it get detected as M29F032 (my flash are AM29F032). So far so good! But the erase doesn't work. It start and get executed for what seem like 1 second then give me a ''Erase complete DQ7'' message but of course the chip doesn't past the blank test. So I really think I was right to suspect my programmer! I'll try to order a new one to test. I'll be shipping your chip back right after if you don't mind.

<br />
<br />Don't worry about returning it, consider it a christmas gift, heh.
<br />
<br />So, basically that one is doing the same thing that yours were doing? or is this kicking out a different error now?
<br />
<br />As for the type of chip, I have about 40 of the AMD/Spansion parts, and 10 of the ST parts (well, now 9 since you have one)  It should be IDing as 20AC.

I'm getting more and more suspicious of my willem being the problem and ordered a new one to be certain. 
<br />
<br />I'll keep you updated, and thanks a lot for all the help you are giving me. You are being very nice to a perfect stranger and I wish I had something I could get you to pay you back.

<br />
<br />I need someone to just confirm that I have understood right the tools I need and the process
<br />
<br />Right cart donor
<br />Eprom Programer
<br />TSOP40 adapter
<br />Pcb adapter
<br />amd29XXX flash memory
<br />Head pins
<br />
<br />
<br />Process- 
<br />
<br />record ROM into flash memory
<br />Solder Memory to PCB adapter
<br />Solder pins to Right Cart donor
<br />
<br />I quite not understood the bridge you have to do with the VCC and the W i think, can anybody explain that a little bit more.
<br />
<br />To my understanding the pcb adapter is ready for straight forward soldering to the donor cart.
<br />
<br />Also if you have more information on additional flash memories that are compatible with this process i will greatly appreciate it!
<br />
<br />Thank you!

<br />
<br />I am sure you can design an adapter for just about any kind of parallel 32mbit flash chip, but those are the most common, and therefore least expensive versions.
<br />
<br />For smaller games (up to 8mbit) the 27C801/27C080 are the most common.

It was the programmer I had, the 5.0e that was creating the issue, I bought a crappy looking old willem on ebay and it worked right away with the chip you gave me and my own. I have wasted so much time over this thing it's nice to finally know it was not me but the programmer. Thanks again for the help!

That might be something to add to your website that some newer willem pcb version not from Sivana are having issue with the flash adapter. Now I only need to work a bit to have the romlabs pcb working, just need to verify again what pin to short on the extra connection to have them programmed. I only need to check the other thread as I remember the info was there.

<br />Was anyone able to get this pcb working from the files in the first few posts? I have some 29F032 chips flashed and I was looking for the right board to go directly onto the snes board.
<br />
<br />Also, are the boards from china, the IC II and III adaptors, are those being used just to program the chips?

<br />
<br />The Type III board is the correct one to take a pre-programmed 29F032 and mount it on an SNES board.  You can also program it with that board using an adapter such as the one I posted for the willem.
