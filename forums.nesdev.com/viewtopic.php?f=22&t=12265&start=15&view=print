Being able to knock them will make them feel less significant then other enemies, which is the point of them. They are an easy target with little reward.

Perhaps it's not as noticeable as I thought.<br />Regardless, this is good to hear, and before the next update I'll make sure to remake some of the levels so it'll be more interesting for anyone trying the game again.

The only piece of criticism I could offer at this point would be to change the palette of the snow stage...it might look a little better if you used cyan for the snow instead of the washed-out gray you have right now.

Here are thoughts that went through my mind as I started it up and progressed:<br /><br />* &quot;What the hell, select button doesn't move cursor on title screen?  Oh, D-pad, okay&quot;<br />* &quot;No select on options screen either, just D-pad again...&quot;<br />* &quot;Start does nothing on options screen?  Oh I see, B is accept...&quot;<br />...started game, jumped around...<br />* &quot;The hell am I doing?  OH!  I can eat guys!  Aww yeah&quot;<br />...progressed to next stage easily, then...<br />* &quot;Oh crap, I fell in the water.  What's that metre in the upper left?  Is that my air?  Timer?  Am I gonna die?&quot;<br />...ate some more things, progressed...<br />* &quot;Oh, NOW I get it, the number in the centre of the screen indicates how many of the things I need to eat.  Eesh this is gonna be hard&quot;<br />...failed repeatedly at the next level, for quite some time...<br />* &quot;Ah ha, the metre is a timer of sorts, or maybe a health metre.  I better eat everything!&quot;<br />* &lt;much cursing at the stage requiring you to eat 8 fish or whatever they are&gt;<br />* &quot;This rain stuff reminds me of Mega Man 2, and the fact that it adds flicker to the sprites is acceptable but is it really worth it?&quot;<br />* &lt;figured out cheap technique for finishing the stage generally easy, feeling very proud of self, albeit guilty at same time&gt;<br />...then the level with the springs...<br />* &quot;How do these springs work?  Hrm, not like the trampoline thing in SMB, that's for sure.  Oh okay, I think I got it.&quot;<br />* &quot;Damn, now how do I eat these birds... Great, one at a time?  Oh wait, maybe if I hold down the button longer I can do some huge open-mouthed leap that chomps up a whole ton in one shot... HAHA YES&quot;<br /><br />Overall impression and score so far: 6.5/10.  Play control feels really good/smooth, guy moves almost a little &quot;too&quot; fast for my liking, but I think that's part of the challenge.  Love the art/style, looks cute/cartoony, like two characters you could really fall in love with (I started fantasising about box art).  Graphics remind me of sort of a mix of Mega Man 2, Snow Brothers, and Kickle Cubicle.<br /><br />I'd absolutely donate money to this on Kickstarter + endorse it much like I did with Lizard, no questions asked.

HAHA YES&quot;</div><br />Wow, that was fun to read and has given me a lot to think about.<br /><br />I didn't think about using select to move through the menus, It's been a while since I've played a game that works that way. That will be easy to add though. Not sure about using start in the options though, I'll do some fiddling with the menu later and see how it feels.<br />I did not expect people to be having as much trouble as they are with the fish level. I thought the level with the birds would of been more frustrating. I'd also like to hear about this cheap technique you used to finish the stage, you have me quite curious.<br />I know the flickering with the rain doesn't look the best but I'm going to try and use a different method for OAM cycling so the rain wont cause the other sprites to flicker. If I can't manage that, I should be able to at least reduce the amount of rain to lessen the flickering.<br />The springs are currently undergoing some changes so they will be easier to use.<br />There's no difference from holding the button, or pressing it, to lunge. Though now that you mention it, I'm getting some ideas, hehe.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Overall impression and score so far: 6.5/10.

The only problem being that, if the player moves much slower, the gravity might need to be changed which would be a lot of work but I'll see how things go.<br />I'm really happy with the score you've given it. I'm glad you like the characters, I've been trying to find as many ways to give them as much personality as I can. I, too, have been fantasising about the box art but I'm trying to not get ahead of myself and focus on the game itself.<br />Once the game is finished, I going to release it for free, so everyone that wants to play it, can.<br /><br />Thank you for the entertainment and your critique.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Cool demo.</div><br />Thanks!

I am still working on the game, albeit slowly, even though I've been silent for so long. There is still a lot of work to be done before it is finished. Most of the levels are complete as well as the art assets but I'm still lacking any music for the game and the sound effects need more work. I'll need to polish it all after all that as well.<br /><br />Until then, here is an updated version of the demo. I wont list all there changes that have been made as there are too many.<br /><br />Enjoy!
