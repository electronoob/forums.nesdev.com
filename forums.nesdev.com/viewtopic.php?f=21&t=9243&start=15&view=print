I'm considering making the encoder count how many cycles it saves by not loading values that were already in one of the registers and use those cycles for extra compression (such as using subroutines for longer repeated patterns). JRS + RTS takes 12 cycles, so only after avoiding 6 load operations I would be able to call a subroutine once (obviously, any savings inside the subroutine will be counted as many times as the routine is called).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A very common usage for the VRAM update is the main character graphics, as there is only one copy of the main character on the screen. VRAM bankswitch won't help with this, as 8 frames would be not enough for main character animation, but may in fact make things more complicated if other sprite animation is needed along with the main character animation.

I know this scheme is crazy and most of you would rather use any of the more conventional ways of handling CHR animations, but I think that the advantages of the technique I'm using outweigh the disadvantages in this case.

Super GNROM style I guess.<br /><br />Tepples:  we're kinda straying from the topic but...  I was thinking mmc3 so you'd get 1/2Kb banks, but if you're designing the mapper yourself you could do whatever you please.  As for part number, I'm referring to the lattice machXO2 CPLD (1200HC) with 7Kb dual ported RAM.  It'd be your mapper, SRAM, save flash, Synth, and capable of MMC5ish capabilities and all for $6-7.  There would be some other added costs but not much more than $1 depending.

That means using a simple mapper just to be able to use more PRG-ROM and keeping raster effects, timed code and forced blanking to a minimum.

Coming from the opposite end of the software/hardware spectrum most of my projects are trying to battle those issues.<br /><br />I think it's good to take your route and try to squeeze every last ounce out of what's available with the NES and a simple discrete mapper.  Obviously there is a lot that can be done with that alone.  Then if one should be so lucky to get to the point of working on a sequel, you can fully appreciate and utilize the hardware expansions.  Really that's what many developers did back in the day with this system, just look at SMB and SMB3.

What is your limit?  That was the main problem with your fast method after all right?  There isn't a significant cost difference in chip prices between 128KB and 512KB, and the mapper cost doesn't change for a BNROM mapper of that size.  <br /><br />It's just my opinion, but some pennies just aren't worth pinching.  Rom size is one of those provided you're under 512KB and have already expanded beyond NROM.  Not to mention if you trip and fall while trying to pick up too many pennies, the end result may be that you never complete your adventure.
