The problem I see is that you're checking old values. At the very beginning,  cameraposition is set to camerax. We then check cameraposition, but change cameraX.

Apologies if I'm rambling about nothing. Like I said before, I tend to see things in just one way, so it's very possible you're doing something I'm not seeing.

( I'm trying to understand my code too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> ) </div><br />Yes. Depending on how your level data subroutines work, passing them out of bounds places to work with could crash your game at worst.<br /><br />Like... CameraX is set to one tile outside the level boundary. The part of your code that draws tiles uses this value of CameraX to know what tile it's supposed to draw. It tries to load data that's not part of your level data. You could end up in an infinite loop loading whatever bytes happen to be passed the end of your level, since those bytes are not actually formatted by you to be used by that subroutine.<br /><br />There are other lesser potential issues, like your scrolling would jerk backwards at the edge of the levels.

I read it through to page 69.  <span style="color: #808080">(I think 69 was the last year we recieved an album release from the Beatles.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)  </span>  During my reading I was extreemly excited to read about their graphics using 8x8 tiles...  JUST LIKE OUR NES! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  But then some disappointment surfaced as I read about the pygame tuples... but maybe that not-like-an-NESness is part of the reason Pygame is a more forgiving environment.  I am enjoying the NES programming a bit more after pygame reading.  It made me return to page 54 of this thread where I reread tokumaru's excellent scrolling is like a camera with a stationary level.  I'm going to stay here in NES land. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />edit: <div class="quotetitle">Kasumi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">cameraposition is given CameraX at the beginning... so they are the same.

You're assuming half the screen is always 128, but that's not true if you scroll. It's clear you know what you want to do but the code you're writing doesn't seem to be doing that. That's all I'm trying to point out. I could be misunderstanding, so here are some images.<br /><br />The green and blue is the level, which the player can only see one screen worth of at a time. The white box is the camera's position in the level. This is what the player is currently seeing. i.e. what's on the screen.<br /><br />The light colored box is the character. The Red line is the middle of the screen. (In between the bounds of what the player is seeing. So the middle of the white box)<br /><br />So, here's the first image. <br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DBd3IdC.png" alt="Image" /><br />The lady's x position is 14 in decimal. $000E. She's to the left of the center of the screen. We load her low byte (#$0E). Its high bit isn't set. So we would take that branch. <br /><br />Here's the second image.<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8YAzZ0O.png" alt="Image" /><br />The lady's x position is 142 in decimal. $008E. But note that the camera also moved. So she's to the left of the center of the screen. We load her low byte (#$8E). Its high bit is set. We would not take that branch.<br />In both images, she's to the left of the screen. In one we would take the branch, in the other we would not.<br /><br />Here's both images together:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0YFYL8b.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />(The second image is probably an impossible scenario with your current code, but hopefully you see where I'm going with them. See below for what I think will happen with the code you have now.)<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xTtGcuq.gif" alt="Image" /><br />There's a new line. The black line represents 256. So when the lady crosses it, her low byte will be 00 again.<br /><br />Note at the beginning, it works as expected. It doesn't scroll with her at the beginning, because it's branching based on her non negative low byte. Then, she reaches the center of the screen ($0080). Her low byte is now negative, and we start to scroll. Then she hits the black line($0100). At that point, her low byte is $00 again. So we stop scrolling because that's a positive low byte. The she reaches the edge of the screen. (Recall that the screen stopped scrolling with her at $00FF. Since the middle of the screen scrolls with her, this makes the right part of the level that the camera is showing $017F.) Then the camera JUMPS to her (from $00FF to $0180), because her low byte is non negative again. (Her full position is $0180).<br /><br />From the player's point of view: <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Y9Zc5FL.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Does this make sense? This is what I think will happen with your current code.

This is what I think will happen with your current code.</div> This does make sense, however on my screen it is kind of different.  The camera doesn't center on the character... it still scrolls when she is past $80 and she eventually reaches the edge of the screen and appears on the other side.  $80 is always middle of screen... I need to distroy that somehow.  Your explaination of what my game should be doing with those images is good.   I can read through your giant paragraph and understand everything... but then it all gets jumbled as I look at your graphic... this means I need to continue rereading and then stareing until it becomes unjumbled.<br /><br />edit: Your graphic skills and brain skills are excellent Kasumi! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  I must reach an unjumbled state.
