		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i was just tinkering with PCM playing code and ended up writing a program that converts WAV audio files into a NES ROM that does nothing but play the data. i'm working on some additional features, and i'll upload the converter soon, not sure if there's much interest in it or anything.
<br />
<br />here's a sample output ROM to demonstrate it. run it in nintendulator or nestopia for best results. the pitch is quite a bit lower than it should be if using FCEUX.

<br />Either way pretty cool though even to just play around with.   I'd be interested in seeing a release. nice work!

<br />
<br />nope, it just depends on the WAV length. i'm converting to 18000 Hz output but i'll make that changeable. i only wrote code to do MMC3, but there is no reason it couldn't use other mappers.
<br />
<br />i'll provide the player code too. it's really simple as you might imagine.

<br />
<br />There is another method without stopping gameplay and stuff: a 7-bit DMC/DPCM Option, but it will lose quality.
<br />
<br />Also there is ROM Size to consider, There is 32kb of ROM Max for most mappers along with bankswitching, so real consoles do not have this, emulators do!
<br />
<br />So you are in a (Fuzzy) Pickle unless you do a mapper of your own, example given earlier by Tepples: Moero! Pro Yakyuu (Japanese Bases Loaded).

<br />
<br />yeah, my music sample ROM is very impractical for a game but it's just to demonstrate it. it would be great for short samples though. say, something at the end of a level or during a title screen, or something similar. my example being 18000 Hz sample rate is also impractical. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I really like that idea!  I had passed it as total impractical in a game, but it would make for a great wow factor on a title screen.

<br />A lot of other developers have had the same idea:
<br /><ul><li>Wheel of Fortune and Skate or Die 2 both have a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleScream" class="postlink">title scream</a>. Action 52 has a sampled theme song and "Make your selection now" speech on the title screen. </li><li>The first Castlevania game for GBA uses an 8-bit LPCM stream on the title screen and sequenced music elsewhere. </li><li>Animal Crossing: Wild World for DS uses a pair of 4-bit ADPCM streams (one for each channel) on the title screen and sequenced music elsewhere. </li></ul>
