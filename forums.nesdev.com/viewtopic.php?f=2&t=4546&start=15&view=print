<br />There's a difference between dollying and panning. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_shot" class="postlink">dollying</a>, the camera moves, and a parallax scroll is appropriate. In panning or tilting, the camera turns, and there is no parallax effect because there is no motion of the camera in space. I'd recommend following the model of Kirby 64, Street Fighter II, and NBA Jam, which use dollying horizontally and tilting vertically. To do this, perform all parallax effects horizontally, but don't perform any vertically.
<br />
<br />But in any case, if you're scrolling vertically, it'll be more difficult to turn off rendering early because you might not always be able to tell where the opaque part of the background is.

<br />What do you mean by that ?
<br />Even a simple SEROM with 32kb PRG and 32kb CHR could handle that : I seems that the screenshots above can be made with approximately 19 tiles, if you dare to repeat those 19 tiles over all 8 availalbe 4kb CHR banks (with mountains shifted vertically), and can do all the rest of graphics like normal exept using only 237 tiles instead of the usual 256, you're done almost like what SEROM would normally limit you too. You get nothing for nothing.
<br />If you use 64kb CHR, this would impose for example that limit only to BG tiles and he's able to handle all sprites with the normal 256 limit.
<br />
<br />
<br />Altough I agree it would be more convignent to have all CHR banks dedicated to one more more than one levels, than having one level using all CHR banks at the same times and the other levels sharing the rest of CHR banks, but this is perfectly possible and not even that limitating.

<br />Every effect needs to justify its existence to the byte-counters, and every byte needs to justify its existence to the bean-counters. If you can make a good argument that dedicating half your CHR ROM to one subtle effect is worth it, then go ahead. Otherwise, five 8-byte copies to CHR RAM start to look good.

<br />Celius is right... Everyone else is making it too complicated...
<br />
<br />Since you reduced the complexity of the mountains, there are very few tiles to update now. There are just 2 for the mountains (side by side), as Celius said, and 2 for the gradient (one on top of the other).
<br />
<br />I don't know if plan on treating the gradient like the mountains, but even if you do, there are in fact only two colors in use for the background, so you can get away with updating a single plane of the tiles if you put those colors in the appropriate order in their palette. So with just 8 bytes per tile you only have to update 32 bytes of pattern table data, and like Celius said this is pretty doable, even considering all other PPU updates necessary (sprites, palettes, name tables, etc).
<br />
<br />And like tepples said, since the edges of your small pattern connect, no name table updates are necessary. Just keep in mind that there are 16 rotations now (doesn't really make a big difference in the code).
<br />
<br />Forget about longer blanking periods and things like that. What threw people off was the original detailed image of the mountains. That would require a lot of work, but the small repeating pattern you have now is easy.

<br />Is 19 tiles per bank half of CHRROM ? It is only 7,4%, and you get nothing for nothing.
<br />And it sounds hard to update 5 CHRRAM tiles and 4 nametable rows in a single VBlank, until you do insane tricks like Battletoads does, which are not to recommand to newbites.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Oh tokumaru posed while I did. Well, maybe I'm making things too complicated, but I don't see how he could do vertical parallax scrolling without nametable updates. If you can then go ahead, again I don't care anyway I'm not doing that in my game and that will still make it decent (I hope).

<br />It's possible because the same small section of mountains is repeated across the whole background, there are no interruptions.
<br />
<br />Name table updates would be necessary only if at some point he wanted only sky and no mountains, for example. Or if the repeating pattern was too long, because it would be impractical to have all possible rotations in CHR-ROM or it would mean too many CHR-RAM updates.
<br />
<br />Name table updates reduce the memory cost because no matter how long your parallax pattern is, you only need 8 rotations. After 8 rotations, all tiles have to be shifted and we go back to the first rotation. But think about it: if instead of updating the name tables you kept rotating the patterns for 8 more steps, a 16-pixel wide area would be covered before name tables updates are needed. Now, imagine that if the repeating image is in fact just 16-pixels wide, like SSD's mountains, redrawing everything shifted 16 pixels is totally unnecessary, because it'd look the same. I suck at explaining stuff, but I hope you got it.
<br />
<br />Just check the games I named, <em>Sword Master</em> and <em>Metal Storm</em>. Neither performs any name table updates related to the parallax effects, it's all CHR-ROM bankswitching.

<br />If he applies what you say, he'll get a mountain rotating itself in the background and that scroll down just as the foreground does. In order to matain the mountain in place, it should be raised in the nametable as the same rate the scrolling raises up.
<br />
<br />Or are you talking about having enough tiles in CHRRAM to cover the whole 30 rows of the nametable ? That would mean 60 tiles should be reserved for the effect (but only 4 of them updated at a time), but yeah no nametable update needed. I guess that's a good idea after all. It'd just be a shame computing the adress of the tiles that needs to be updated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Also, since it's only 32 bytes, you might even be able to set aside an array for that in Zero Page. So it would actually be 224 cycles to do it.
<br />
<br />Also, I think you mentioned to me once, Tokumaru, the idea of doing CHR RAM updates when there's free time. Say if you're not updating a row or a column of tiles, then you could update the CHR RAM data. Though this might not be such a good idea in situations where there are always updates for whatever reason.
<br />
<br />Though if you are scrolling vertically, you'll want to modify the name table as well as the tiles. It just didn't look like that's what you were doing.
<br />
<br />You know, you're not just limited to working with the BG and shifting tiles. Sprites operate on a coordinate system, and can go behind the background (except for color #0). Perhaps you might benefit from doing <em>something</em> with sprites. I'm not saying make a mountain out of sprites (that's a bad idea, especially since you only have 64 sprites and 8 on a scanline), but you might be able to do something with them. In my game, you'll enter a cavern-type area, and there'll be some icicle-type rock formations hanging down that will be made of sprites, and there'll be parallax for them.
<br />
<br />Another thing I might do is for something like a large moon, make the circular part out of sprites while filling the center in with solid BG tiles. This would require only writes to the name table, but it'd probably require a lot of sprites to completely cover the solid BG tile edges. You'd want to do this with 8x16 sprites because it's big, but your biggest issue would be worrying about the 8 sprite per scanline limit. If you have the circle part of the moon flickering when the BG doesn't, it'll look pretty bad.

I originally restricted the background and each 16x16 pixel region of the foreground to two colors each so they could play well together with the palette/attribute tables.

<br />That's a really great idea, and in fact I plan to do exactly that, but not for the background due to the sprite/scanline limitations you mentioned. I intend to use some sprites to create an additional foreground layer (maybe high altitude cirrus clouds), which will actually scroll <em>faster</em> than the platforms as you ascend the mountain. What's cool about using sprites for the clouds is that I can also move them horizontally to indicate wind.

<br />
<br />I really dislike some really stationary backgrounds where it looks really really flat; especially ones with skies. Using sprites for the moon and clouds really eliminates this garbage wall paper look. Though sometimes that adds character to a game, I generally just think it looks bad.
<br />
<br />EDIT: About making the foreground, that is a really great idea. Having a foreground like you mentioned really makes it look 3Dish. In my opinion it has way more effect than making an extra background layer. Both in combination will really make your game look great (assuming you pull it off right).

Well, maybe not the lack of vertical effects, but yeah, I was completely disregarding vertical parallax effects. This would make things extremely complicated.<br /><br />Like tepples suggested, there are games with horizontal parallax effects only, while vertical scrolling works as usual, and that doesn't look bad at all. I guess we tend to forgive the lack of attention to vertical scrolling. Even in Sonic games you can find several levels where the background doesn't move up or down at all. I can't remember if there is any that scrolls at the same rate as the foreground though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The montains in the background doesn't look to loop forever in his screenshots, which changes a lot of things !</div><br />Of course they look like they loop! They are only interrupted by foreground objects, and there is no problem with that.

<br />Oh yeah, but this is probably not appropriate for parallax effects, as the movement would look pretty jerky when updates failed to be executed on time, because the foreground would still scroll, meaning that the mountains would be moved the same amount as the foreground, and you'd cancel out half of their movement only on the next frame... they would appear to flicker or shake back and forth, really bad...
<br />
<br />This idea was originally for updating animations of objects... Since objects rarely have their graphics changed every frame (it's more like every 4 frames for 15FPS animations) a delay of 1 frame to load the new graphics shouldn't really be noticeable.
<br />
<br />@SecretServiceDude: Sorry, I missed the part where you showed you'd need to change 5 tiles and just from looking at it I assumed 4 (although you could easily reduce it to 4 if you shifted the graphics down a bit, unless you have a very specific reason to use that particular vertical position). But still, with the single plane trick we're looking at 40 bytes, pretty doable. Like Celius suggested, that's so little you could even buffer the bytes in zero page, so that it'll be quicker to read them, although that's not a requirement if you have the VBlank time to spare.
<br />
<br />If you are feeling like optimizing it really bad, you could take advantage of the fact that the gradient has a few lines that alternate, so you could keep the 2 patterns in 2 different registers and perform a few writes before needing to load new patterns, saving some time. And the bottom of the mountains tiles have a few lines that are always filled and need nu updates at all! Of course this is specific to the mountains, and if you plan to use the same code for different graphics you'd better stick with full tile updates. You could have optimal copying routines for each type of graphics, but that sounds a bit extreme if you're not really short of VBlank time.

<br />If the mountains were locked in place, I would definitely shift them down to fit nicely within tile boundaries. But the key point here is that the mountains are <em>not</em> stationary; I intend to scroll them 1 pixel for every 16 pixels of foreground movement. Since the mountains will scroll (albeit slowly), most of the time they probably won't fit nicely within tile boundaries, which is why I update that extra tile.
<br />
<br />I hope that clears up any misunderstandings, just in case there were any.
