For anything</div><br />Before Adobe seriously beefed up ActionScript and browser makers added the new JavaScript APIs associated with HTML5, the Java applet environment was the primary way to deploy rich Internet applications with no &quot;installation&quot; step. A lot of early smart phones relied on Java MIDP for applications as well. And now that Android has become popular, Java is &quot;in&quot; again. XNA will just get you onto Xbox Live Indie Games and Windows Phone 7, both of which are becoming very obsolete very fast.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I also love when people refer to the days of 64k of RAM as if it were the lowest possible capacity.

The &quot;64K&quot; computers had to load programs from a magnetic disk before running them, while the NES more commonly uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execute_in_place" class="postlink">XIP (execute in place) ROM</a>. To be honest, you need to compare them to the 44K of a Famicom with the FDS system card inserted.<br /><br />But there's a tradeoff between runtime efficiency and maintainability (developer-time efficiency). This becomes especially important when the requirements of a product or service change often to meet market needs.

This prompted an <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2013-February/072529.html" class="postlink">off-topic response from a kernel developer</a>, who made an effort to argue that there's effectively no difference and that I'm <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2013-February/072532.html" class="postlink">basically bitching for no reason</a>.  I <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2013-February/072530.html" class="postlink">made my case in an itemised list</a>, which was also <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2013-February/072531.html" class="postlink">backed by another fellow</a> (pointing to an actual program that builds parts of FreeBSD itself which broke for him solely for that reason!).  I <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2013-February/072534.html" class="postlink">provided a write up</a> with a C program demonstrating the effects/facts.  Of course <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2013-February/072541.html" class="postlink">he refuted this</a>, and <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2013-February/072545.html" class="postlink">I responded this morning</a>.<br /><br />The modus operandi these days is often &quot;who gives a shit&quot; or &quot;there's so many resources available it doesn't matter&quot;, even when presented with facts/information that show quite clearly it does matter.  There's really no downside to developing software today with a &quot;minimal&quot; mentality.  You don't have to necessarily worry about every single bit/byte -- no need to be that pedantic in most cases -- but resources being more available now than they were in the past is no reason to become lazy.  It reminds me of the completely fucked up argument I've seen many times over the years: &quot;unused memory is wasted memory&quot;.  Yes, just <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">malloc&#40;999999999999999999&#41;</tt>, otherwise it's going to waste......<br /><br />I hate having to discuss shit like this with people because it <strong>ALWAYS</strong> results in people asking me to effectively define things black-and-white, when I'm certain they know damn well the situations always vary.  But really there <strong>is</strong> a mentality/approach that works universally, and that's &quot;if you aren't sure when/why to use Method Y, just use Method X and you'll be fine&quot;.  This is one of those cases, so I'm irritated that I'm having to further expand on/debate it.<br /><br />P.S. -- For folks who have known me for a very long time (i.e. 15+ years), discussions like in the aforementioned linked threads are what effectively hardened me + turned me into a general prick.  Usenet and mailing lists are full of this type of thing, then it moved to IRC, and today it's on forums.  So in case you ever wanted to know why I'm such a hard-ass and why I have a condescending tone whenever I write something, it's because the above is more or less what I've dealt with for the vast majority of my online life.  I'm a <strong>lot</strong> easier to talk to/get along with in person.</span>

But it does let you very quickly create 3D games running in Windows that look very nice, perform pretty well, and work out of the box (provided you have the XNA framework installed). There are upsides and downsides to everything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just wanted to say that I found this thread really helpful!<br />I've been struggling to understand how the PPU registers work and I think I finally start to get it.<br />I think I just didn't understand that the PPU uses the same registers for multiple tasks and I was confused by the names that loopy used and names like PPUSCROLL and so on. Maybe I can grasp it now :3<br /><br />And about the topic of programming on a limited system:<br />I was born in the early 90s and I only know one other programmer in my age (personally!) who has tried to program something for a limited environment in assembly language. What got me interested in trying this myself was the Gameboy. When you just use it for playing games, it appears very limited, but when you start to look at the hardware it actually seems quite capable. Unfortunately only few games show this.<br />All other programmers (at least the ones in my age!) I talk to, just look at me weird when I explain them what RLE is or why one would program something on interrupt basis, instead of just accessing and updating data whenever it feels right to do so.<br />And once I say that I have a hard time understanding object oriented programming they start to laugh.<br /><br />Sometimes this gives me the feeling that I try to learn things in a totally backwards way and just waste my time with it.<br />But then again I like to spend time reading the documentation of systems like the NES or the Gameboy and trying to figure out how these systems work. In the end I agree with you all in that it might help to make me a better programmer, because it is a worthwhile experience that more people should have.<br /><br />I think the only way to get a similar experience nowadays without having an &quot;obsession&quot; with old systems is to program a microcontroller. I'm not talking about those highly capable ARM ones, but maybe a small ATMEGA/ATTINY or PIC. I think this could serve as a nice hands-on approach to anyone who has never tried something like this before.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Python is my favourite programming language <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Thanks guys for posting this really informative discussion!

Unfortunately only few games show this.</div><br />Game Boy games cost less than NES games at retail, pushing budgets down. Game Boy (pre-Pocket) had a primitive LCD, pushing achievable frame rates down. Game Boy had little vertical blank time; updates in horizontal blank interleaved with game logic may have been harder to adapt to. Game Boy had no software envelope without the audible click of restarting the note; music engines had more &quot;plinky&quot; instruments. Game Boy's speaker had no bass (GBA's speaker, for example, had a -18 dB/octave rolloff below 800 Hz); composition had to compensate. And Game Boy had an unfamiliar CPU to programmers not familiar with Nintendo's competitors' consoles.
