<br />
<br />* Do not use the entire screen for filebrowsing. The top/bottom disappears on my widescreen (PAL) tv and I have to manually pick 4:3 mode.
<br />
<br />* Implement B-button for cancel loading. If I want to load a game and selects the wrong one by mistake there is no way of going back(?) with resetting the console.
<br />
<br />* Pro Action Replay support if possible

<br />The title safe area on a 16:9 PAL TV that thinks it's getting a letterboxed signal is roughly 192 pixels tall (288 line PAL signal * 3/4 for widescreen * 90% TSA factor). Coincidentally, this was also the title safe area specified by Atari for VCS 2600 games on NTSC TVs, back in the late 1970s when people still had a lot of 1960s TVs with rounded corners.

<br />
<br />The B-button idea is good, too.  Even though I knew the controls going in, I still wished that would work.  Maybe have be goto ../ in the file browser, too.
<br />
<br />Just my 2 cents..
<br />
<br />Also - I'm going to be looking though the code tonight to see if I can figure this out myself, despite no experience in any nes programming (outside of nsf's) as of yet.  At least I have some programming experience, and I know I learn best the hard way <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> -- Never mind about that.. I just realized the code I thought I saw was actually for mapper dev.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I suggested to bunnyboy before about truncating the middle of a long file name instead of the end, with an ellipsis marking the point of truncation.  If the first and last 12 characters or so were displayed, it would in most cases be sufficient to distinguish between titles with long and similar names.  I don't think it's feasible to implement the display of full filenames, given NES limitations.  After all, you can always truncate the filename before uploading to the CF card if necessary.
<br />
<br />Restricting to 192 pixels vertically seems excessive, but it may be better to err on the side of accessibility here.  I personally have gone back and forth on this issue ever since seeing the demo video posted some weeks back.

<br />
<br />Any mapper related issues can be fixed by members currently, but not sure if we have access to the menu interface for modification (if we do, then I guess we can all get to work <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)

<br />
<br />That's awesome that it's on the CF card instead, would make testing new stuff out a hell of a lot easier. It would appear the menu code would have to be in amongst the files B,E,I,N,O,Q, and S.map. If we could get a rundown of what each of those files needs to do and if they have any special format, that would be great.

Bunnyboy will be very hesistant in making boot ROM changes, not only because of the CopyNES requirement, but also because changing the boot ROM code can potentially require an update to all CF drivers, since there's no guarantee that subroutines will remain at the same start addresses (bunnyboy should've used a jump table...).
