The logic for calculating distances to walls and figuring out their height in a raycaster is pretty simple, the NES can certainly do it if the number of columns is not so high. Since the walls don't have textures, a few tiles with different angles would be enough for drawing all sorts of walls.

<br />
<br />His profile says he's 23 years old and from Afghanistan.  This has led Youtube posters to assume he has died, since he is from the Middle East.  Perhaps less than logical, though it is true he hasn't signed in for a year.
<br />
<br />As to whether what he showed is possible?  I would say yes.  The enemy and barrel scaling might be difficult, but the walls are pretty simple, nothing but straight lines.  There are no divisions between walls, no lighting, only a single flat perspective.  If it was fake I would expect to see some really obviously broken rules, but I'm not seeing that here.  Heck, I've seen <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4005&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" class="postlink">more complex 3D posted here</a> (<a href="http://doynax.googlepages.com/polynes3.nes" class="postlink">ROM</a>).

<br />
<br />Never say something is impossible; I can imagine several ways you might accomplish scaling, though perhaps not on this level.  A really crazy person might go ahead and have a full bank for each slight movement.  Unwieldy, yes, but possible.
<br />
<br />I was able to pause on a frame where he was up close to the enemy and I admit <a href="http://img212.imageshack.us/img212/6753/93393791.png" class="postlink">it looks pretty suspect.</a>  The edges of the enemy seem extra fuzzy as if it were a texture up close and not a pixel-perfect NES image (the gun and wall edge are much clearer).  But at the same time, this is a low res youtube video that can render things funny at times.
<br />
<br />There's also a strange issue where the edges of his scaled images are slightly transparent, or have a blue edge to them:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/5640/25410819.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I think I've seen this on sprites before online (gifs), though I'm not sure what causes it.  Manual editing that misses pixels, or scaling in an image editor perhaps.  Is there any reasonable explanation for these artifacts to occur on a NES?  Supposing he actually found a way to do scaling, could it be misaligned sprites or something?  The blue parts aren't uniform every time we see the enemy.

<br />The weirdest thing I see is the very smooth object scaling. The bitmaps have very low resolution, yes, but they seem to be scaled every frame, something that would require complete recalculation and updating of many tiles, and that just can't be done that fast.

<br />Don't underestimate the power of 8-bit machines. Something as sparse as this could most likely be done demo-style, with highly optimized routines and some degree precalculation (perhaps, for example, he has in ROM the enemy "sprites" scaled to a few interim resolutions so that scaling can be done more efficiently at smaller sizes).
<br />
<br />Sure, the NES can't do DOOM proper. It could definitely handle a DOOM-style game with simplified graphics and sound, with the right coder behind it. Look at all the C64 demos that have simple DOOM-style parts, and they generally use redefinable characters rather than bitmap mode so it is comparable to the tile-based NES.

<br />Defining too many patterns on the fly is a pretty sluggish thing on the NES. I believe that if a playable raycaster ever shows up on the NES, it will use pre-calculated patterns. I'm not saying the other way is impossible, I just have more faith on the pre-defined patterns.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You know, it's actually possible for the walls to be that resolute if you use a little raycasting to determine the heights of each end of each wall displayed, and then use a line drawing routine to draw from one end to the other. Then you can just use XOR filling to fill between the lines (making the walls a solid color), so you're basically doing polygonal stuff but with VERY limited 3D calculation. That of course would require use of CHR RAM and dynamic tile drawing. The good news is you would hardly ever have to copy over more than 64 tiles of CHR data (Since that's about as many tiles as the lines would require to be drawn), so it wouldn't be so bad in terms of causing slow-down (you would probably have to do a fair deal of artificial blanking though). Perhaps I'm missing something, but I think this would be a pretty good alternative to casting for each column. I'm not quite sure about enemies/objects though...

<br />
<br />The hand with the gun is 3 colors, so when it overlaps both the green and the blue it's 5 colors. So the hand and gun cannot be rendered using background tiles but would have to be sprites layered above the background.
<br />
<br />If it is sprites, there is no reason to give it such low resolution other then to  make it look lowtech.
