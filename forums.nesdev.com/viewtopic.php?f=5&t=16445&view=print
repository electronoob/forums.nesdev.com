		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Today, with all the wikis out there, you can learn about the details of video game franchises pretty easily. But back in the 80s and 90s, that wasn't so easy.<br />So, I often assumed certain things about video games, especially their plots, that turned out to be completely false later on.<br /><br />Some examples:<br /><br /><br />When &quot;Pok√©mon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; came out, I wasn't aware of the concept of the silent protagonist. So, when you go to fight Red, his pre- and post-fight dialog simply consists of &quot;...&quot;<br />When I saw this, I said to my brother: &quot;Man, Ash has become really arrogant.&quot;<br /><br />For a long time, I was under the assumption that Princess Daisy is Mario's love interest.<br />The reason: I only knew the &quot;Super Mario Land&quot; Game Boy games and the &quot;Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot;. And Mario and Princess Toadstool never had any romantic feelings for each other in the show. But in &quot;Super Mario Land&quot;, you see a heart floating up when Mario rescues Princess Daisy.<br />Funnily, this assumption wouldn't even have changed if I had known the NES games. Because you won't find any romance between Mario and Princess Toadstool there either. Only with &quot;Super Mario World&quot; and &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot; was this made obvious in-game.<br /><br />I also thought that King Koopa from the TV show and Bowser were two separate characters. After all, that guy from the games that I've seen in the magazines has red hair and is overall more yellow than green.<br /><br />In &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, I always thought that M. Bison was the winner of the previous year's tournament, with Sagat having lost to M. Bison in the final, and Vega being on place 3 and Balrog on place 4.<br />The idea that Ryu is the champion at the start of the game never came to my attention. I knew about Ryu having given Sagat his scar, but I thought that was some private out-of-torunament battle that happened long ago.<br />Even when I found out the story, I couldn't wrap my head around it: If Ryu is the champion, why is M. Bison the final opponent?<br />Only many years later did I find out that M. Bison is actually supposed to be the host of the tournament. I knew this concept from &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; where Shang Tsung hosts the tournament and is therefore the final opponent, but I never figured that this applies to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; as well.<br /><br /><br />Did you experience similar things as well? Let's hear them.<br /><br /><br />Oh yeah, and another one about Mario: When I finished &quot;Yoshi's Island&quot; and the stork delivers Mario to his parents into that Smurf-like mushroom village, I asked myself: &quot;Do they have mushroom houses somewhere in Rome?&quot;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I never cared much about the story in video games, only about the gameplay. I guess I probably had a lot of misconceptions about games, considering I didn't speak English at all at the time I began playing games. Game manuals were usually translated, but most of the games I played were either imported, or rented/borrowed without a manual. I had to come up with my own explanations for the events in Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Altered Beast, Shinobi, E-SWAT... I remember thinking that E-SWAT was more similar to RoboCop, where the cop was turned into a cyborg rather than it being just an armor.<br /><br />I didn't give much importance to the stories I came up with though, and I didn't try to make it all fit with sequels and such, like so many people do. In the Sonic fandom for example there are people who live to tie together the storylines of ALL the games, classic, modern and even spin-offs, something that even the developers obviously didn't try to do. That's a huge waste of time IMO.

(They probably just wanted to grab more money by selling the slot converter. Also, the Mark III could also run SG-1000 games, though without the need of a converter.) Together with the fact that Most of Nintendo's handheld systems could play games of at least one generation before (like GB games on the GBC, GB(C) games on the GBA, GBA games on the NDS, etc., at least for the initial versions), it's convincing enough that the SFC could run FC games, as there is only a &quot;Super&quot; sticked onto the name. This was supposed to be true also, that the SFC was initially designed to run also FC games (as depicted in say, early magazine articles), but the idea was probably scraped early in development, for the better IMO, so the designers are more free to do more alternations and enhancements to the system without the need to care for backward compatibility. Otherwise there weren't much justified reasons to use a 65816 as the SFC's CPU. I'm not saying the 65816 is bad compared to other CPUs such as the 68000 (as many people here will prove otherwise), but the 65816 was so obscure at the time that it was only used by a few obscure systems (neither of which popular in Japan), which led to programmers inexperience with it to produce not-as-well-coded games in the system's early days, unless alienating the programmers was intentional in their plans(such as, sometimes it was said they used 6502 in the original FC intentionally to make programmers suffer as that CPU wasn't popular in Japan).<br /><br />Oh... right! Back to misconceptions.<br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Back in the days, some magazine posted some articles (clearly written by noobs) about Nintendo designing the 16-bit descendant of the Famicom (before even the PCE and MD came out), citing the use of the 16-bit 65816 would be like being able to work on stuff with both hands instead of just one(I think this is true to some degree) and that you can do twice the stuff <em>with the same amount of memory!</em> As I always trusted word for word from these magazines I believed this kind of BS for a while.</li><li>There used to be some practice in some gaming magazines to post <em>intentionally</em> incorrect information, so that they'd know when some other rival magazines had copied their stuff verbatim (this practice is common in map makers too, as they would introduce fake cities, streets, etc. in their maps to avoid others copying them). I think some magazines had some prizes for readers spotting the errors in each issue too. Again, as I trusted them that much (they had (mock-up) screenshots for proof!) I tried and tried repeatedly with some of the tricks, which never worked, thinking it's my fault in missing something. Two frustrating examples are, a) in Double Dragon (1), if you do some sequence involving the VS mode, you can actually have 2-P coop in the main game! and the player 2 is Kunio, not Jimmy!, and b) if you boot Bio Miracle Upa from side B, you can actually play a hidden Salamander game, with Upa himself as your ship! (Ironically this was made sorta possible in some of the Parodius games later.)</li><li>There was a time (probably late 90's to early 00's when PCE emulation started to become a thing), where there were numerous rumours spreading around online, that the PCE used <em>two</em> 8-bit CPUs, each clocking at ~3.5MHz. That's why it was advertised as a 16-bit system with &quot;total&quot; clock speed ~7MHz. Because parallel computing wasn't easy at the time, many games ended up using only one CPU core so these games could never drive the system to its full potential (similar things actually happened in the Sega Saturn), so Mega Drive games were much better! This is of course BS. The PCE has one single CPU derived from the 8-bit 65C02, clocked at full 7+ MHz (unless you set it to low speed mode to access save RAM).</li><li>The above are mostly caused by misinformation provided from materials in various media, but for a real &quot;self-made&quot; misconception: When the PCE and MD were out, I thought the MD games looked much better as the graphics looked cleaner and brighter and more colourful, whereas PCE games tended to use over-heavily shading, that made them look dark and unpleasant, possibly done deliberately to hide the fact that the PCE was <em>only</em> a 8-bit system, and that it even lacked parallax scrolling so it was worthless! Also, FM synthesis sounded much more high tech than the Waveform Memory technique (whatever they called it BiTD) used in the PCE so the sound in PCE sucked! After a few years I ended up liking PCE games more and eventually got the system, never bothering the the MD anymore. Then a few more years had passed and I was toying around the Genecyst emulator, opening up some of the windows, which shocked me heavily when I discovered the MD only had 4 sub-palettes, backgrounds and sprites combined. Then I realised that the reason there rarely was heavy shading in MD games was that it could hardly handle that (unless you sacrifice colours).</li></ol>

The truth is, he is neither. Dr Doom is more associated with Fantastic 4 than the other Marvel franchises (though of course, since we're talking about western comics, he could and would appear in any of the Marvel series).
