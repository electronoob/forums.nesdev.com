<br />
<br />Dunno.  My current version has progressed a little beyond what I submitted, uses structs n' such.  However I'm moving my code over to NESHLA so anyone who want's to improve/fix the CA65 version go ahead. TBH I just tried to port it as fast as possible and potentially massacred the code in the process.
<br />
<br />However that JSR I think is definitely a bug. Technically it looks like it could just fall-through.

<br />
<br />Now you should use C00 effect in end of every effect (C00 just stops playback). Converter changed, archive is updated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm trying to convert Famitone to get it to work in asm6.  Admittedly I am probably not the best person for this job, as I'm rusty with this stuff and also was never that smart to begin with.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />There were four main things that stopped asm6 from compiling.
<br />
<br />First was the labels - they're all meant to be local, but asm6 handles its local labels differently.  I went through and added + and - to the beginning of all labels accordingly, and I think this problem is fixed.
<br />
<br />Secondly, lines like lda [FT_TEMP],y resulted in a "label not found" error.  I changed the brackets to parenthesis and the errors stopped.  Still not sure whether this was a mistake because I'm having trouble prior to reaching one of these statements...
<br />
<br />Third was NESASM's LOW() function.  From what I can tell, asm6's version of this is the &lt; operator, so I replaced instances of LOW with &lt;.  However, this may not be working correctly.
<br />
<br />I tried to get Famitone working with an existing program of mine, but upon calling FamiToneInit, the program seems to hang.  When I step through it, it gets to the line ldx #&lt;(FT_CHANNELS) which evaluates to ldx #&lt;($600+6)...and for some reason, this loads the value 6 into x, even though that RAM location is empty and I'd expect 0 from the low bits.
<br />
<br />The final problem I had was that there were two lines with a "value out of range" error.  This one from the envelopeStep routine:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-readByte<br />lda ($40),y			;read byte of the envelope<br />iny						;increase pointer<br />ora #0<br />bpl +special			;if it is below 127, it is special code<br />clc						;otherwise it is an output value+192<br /><strong>adc #-192<br />*** Value out of range.</strong><br />sta $0600+0,x<br />tya<br />sta $0600+4,x			;remember the pointer and return<br />rts</div><br /><br />And this one from FamiToneSfxUpdate:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-readByte<br />lda ($40),y			;read byte of effect<br />iny<br />cmp #$10				;if it is less than $10, it is register write<br />bcc +getData<br />cmp #$ff				;if it is $ff, it is end of the effect<br />bcs +eof<br /><strong>adc #-$10				;otherwise it is number of repeats +$10<br />*** Value out of range.</strong></div><br /><br />Since they both appeared to be attempting to add a negative, I just changed each into subtracting a positive and that eliminated the error.  I haven't gotten far enough that I can test this yet to make sure it's not causing any problems.<br /><br />---<br /><br />As a side note to this, using text2data to convert a song to asm6 format resulted in errors for me.  The resulting file contained references to a nonexistent .env_default, when I'm sure it meant @env_default:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">...<br /><br />@ins<br />	dw @env_default,@env_default,@env_default<br />	db $30,$00<br />	dw @env_vol0,@env_arp2,.env_default<br />	db $30,$00<br />	dw @env_vol1,.env_default,@env_pitch0<br />	db $70,$00<br />	dw @env_vol2,@env_arp0,.env_default<br />	db $70,$00<br />	dw @env_vol2,@env_arp1,.env_default<br />	db $70,$00<br />	dw @env_vol3,.env_default,.env_default<br />	db $30,$00<br />	dw @env_vol4,@env_arp0,.env_default<br />	db $70,$00<br />	dw @env_vol4,@env_arp1,.env_default<br />	db $70,$00<br />	dw @env_vol5,.env_default,.env_default<br />	db $30,$00<br /><br />...</div>
<br />
<br />Possibly a bug in text2data?  It compiled fine after I changed them to @s instead of .s.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually, FamiTone is full of minor bugs (mostly in tools, not in the sound code), which aren't found and not fixed yet because no one used it in an actual project.
<br />
<br />Today I'm fixed a problem with sound effects converter, some bugs in TextExporter (weren't noticeable on old computer by some reason), and a bug in text2data reported by UncleSporky above.
<br />
<br />I still use NESASM, so don't know about Asm6 much. LOW/HI functions are value&amp;255 and value/256. So, LOW($600+6) is $06.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That must not be the problem at all, then...I'll keep looking and see if I can get it to work.
<br />
<br />Specifically what is happening now is that my main loop is supposed to spin on $2002, waiting for vblank.  After I add in a line to call FamiToneInit during the regular initialization, after I turn IRQs on and read $2002 once it jumps to IRQ (which is just rti) and stays there forever.
<br />
<br />Definitely something due to my own ignorance, I'll keep at it.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Disabling IRQs gets past this, but I'd rather fix the problem than leave it like that.  I'm assuming it's DMC related, though I thought I turned off Famitone's DMC related code.
<br />
<br />In any case, in a few minutes I should be able to see if I can at least get the music playing.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Awesome, I got the music working!  Except my entire background is now bouncing up and down for some reason.  Ah well.

<br />
<br />It's just not always immediately obvious what the limits are by checking a debugger.  Just wanted to confirm it before I go changing stuff and end up with hard-to-fix bugs.
