<br />
<br />But, it doesn't me that I would do it personally. My opinion on the Contra video would be a little harsh thought.  Screen quality wise, yes, I do see an improvement except for the color of the title screen (maybe there is a reason behind it, TV screen setting or something).  As for the music, I thought on the other hand that it didn't sound the same anymore. All the drum line done by PCM was missing, filtered out in some way.  In that case, I prefer the original.
<br />
<br />Going from an RF famicom (crap video/sound) to an AV one was already a big improvement. so in which situation does this hack would be useful? My guess would be on HD tv maybe? I don't have one yet to play around so I cannot say.

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">That said, the *quality* difference of the audio mod in question is quite nice.  It must be using an OPAMP of some kind, and/or some very basic filter circuitry.  I noticed that the PCM "pops" are significantly minimised.  However, those "pops" are actually used by some games for a drum/bass beat, such as in the "underground" areas in Crystalis.</div><br /><br />Yes that's right the bass pops aren't as bold anymore with this mod.  The bass drum in tmnt 2, and final fantasy 3, is less noticable once you do this mod.  And for some strange reason kirbys adventure has 2 songs where you don't clearly hear all the snare drum hits.  Other than that everything else sounds fine.  I'd love to find any suggestions on how to fix this issue.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Regarding <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v7e-bjB13s" class="postlink">the video</a> -- wow, look at the Contra title screen.

If you're complaining about that row of pixels on the right that is doing random stuff, that doesn't show up on my tv.  My capture card captures a larger range of video than my tv displays.

<br />
<br />On my non HD crt tv going from composite video of a non-modded av famicom to s-video from the modded once is like night and day.  It's a huge difference in pixel sharpness.  Some people like that you know.  Graphics are no longer blurred together.  Also a lot of my clients enjoy having brighter colours.  If you do this mod and don't like the colours being so bright, then why not turn down the colour strength on your tv.

The "stereo mod" crap really irritates me; once you tell someone that the "stereo mod" just results in the two triangle channels coming out of the right speaker and the triangle/noise and PCM coming out the left, they go "Uhhhh.... screw that".  The stereo mods result in the music itself sounding like complete and total crap; this wasn't how the musicians intended for their stuff to be listened to, it was intended to be monaural.</div>
<br />Yes, but a stereo mod can sound okayish and give the sound more depth if both outputs of 2A03 are mixed to both left and right channels with varying ratios (i.e. only ever so slightly panorated to the left/right).

<br />It's not like when you're on your PC and that your speakers are located directly on your left and right where the separation is more marked, or worse : if you're using headphones then they will be 100% separated.

This is known problem with the RGB PPU being used. Really what would make such a mod worth while would be if someone made a RGB PPU clone that used color palettes identical to the NTSC system, adjusted so they would appear as close as possible to the NTSC look which nearly all games were designed to be viewed in.
<br />
<br />I do understand the problems with HDTVs and the NES Composite signal being displayed with alot of problems which may be reduced by using S-Video or RGB. But it seems you are just trading one problem for another. Just buy a good quality TV or Monitor that accepts Composite video. The NES looks extremely sharp and clear on my Sony PVM. I see no need for RGB.

<br />I know I'll sound dumb, but what about using Nestopia ? That way you have :
<br />Composite -&gt; Use NTSC filter
<br />RGB with right colors -&gt; Use plain bilinear filter
<br />
<br />And NO bad connector problem, NO save lost problem etc... The only thing the real NES is good at today is to test your soft on it to make sure it works on real hardware.
<br />
<br />Oh and by the way, does Noha's Ark and Just Breed work with a RGB PPU ? How does transitions to battle in Final Fantasy look ? I just wonder about the color emphasis bits.

<br />In fact this is the only reason I still use a real NES for something other than testing.
<br />The controller maybe, but after all a keybods is just as good as any controller. In fact it's even better for some games such as Mega Man X games where you need to hits many keys to dash, charge and slide at the same time, but for the NES where there is less buttons it doesn't change many things.
<br />
<br />Audio latency let me laugh. Unless it gets in the 40ms you won't notice it, and I'm pretty sure typical latency is about 10ms (less than a NTSC frame).
<br />And you PC is probably constantly connected with a monitor  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> 
<br />The D-Pad of a keyboard is just fine for gaming (unless you have one of those crappy keyboards with fat keys).

<br />Say I connect two USB keyboards, one for each player. Or I have player 1 use the laptop's internal keyboard and player 2 use a USB keyboard. Most emulators that I've tried don't appear to support the Raw Input API that lets a Windows program determine from which of the two connected keyboards each keypress came. So a player pressed the left arrow key; was it the left arrow key of keyboard 1 or the left arrow key of keyboard 2?
