Does anyone reccomend wladx to NESHLA? What I hate about NESHLA is that there are SO MANY INCLUDED FILES! I don't even know where to start. Because I think he included those H files to like define Macros and crap, and the files are included in the actual game, and you can't really say that you wrote the whole code with that being the situation. you know what I mean? But yeah, which one do you think is better?

<br />Wla-DX is really great, and is multiplatformal, so you have to bother with the standards once, and you can programm the NES; the SNES, the GameBoy and such others systems.
<br />However, HES HLA is still interessting because of it's strange and interesting macro system. I'm asking myself wich one I'll definitely use for Ecological Evolution.
<br />In others words : If you're a hardcore assembler coder, use WlaDX, if you're more familiar with C, use NES-HLA.

For SNES SPC-700 sound CPU assembly I use wla 9.3 (September 2004) and am really disgusted at its unclear/non-existent documentation (or else I have overlooked the real documentation). For example, try finding an explanation of how slots and banks work. In contrast, ca-65 is well-documented.

<br />
<br />That would help if I knew <em>what</em> the hell a slot was. If an assembler author is introducing a new compulsory concept (as in, I can't ignore it if I want to use the assembler), he needs to describe it.
<br />
<br />In general terms, a model consists of objects and behaviors (actions). The objects the assembler uses is hidden behind the commands (actions); both have to be comprehended before one can make sense of it.

I get so confused with .db and stuff, and it sucks, cause I never know where anything is in the stack, and I get so confused. Maybe that's just programming NES in general for me. I don't see how in the Mario Bros source code, they just make a level by saying this:
<br />
<br />.db $20,$d3,$ef,$f6
<br />
<br />Dude, I don't know it those were really the exact ones, but it was like that. I am still rather confused about some things in 6502 programming. Like Flags, and stuff. And clear carry set garbage and all that. I just don't get it. I'm gonna stop talking now.

<br />It sure is. That's nothing to do with the assembler, but, in that case, maybe NES HLA would be better for you (because it does everything automically).

<br />If you target several architectures and want a common assembler, wla dx is probably better.

<br />Another advantage of Wla-DX, you just have to post your feathure request on its <a href="http://www.phpbbserver.com/phpbb/index.php?mforum=wladx" class="postlink">message boards</a>, and the author will include it in Wla-DX. In wich other assembler can you "custom" your feathures like that ??
