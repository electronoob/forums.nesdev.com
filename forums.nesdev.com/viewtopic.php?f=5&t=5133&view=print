<br />There was an entire episode of Game Center CX dedicated to this game (which isn't anything spectacular, except that the dude playing it was *incredibly* frustrated by how hard it was).  ;-)

They almost never put their name on the game (except in Mottomo Abunai Deka), and their games were identified by code signature and the pause sound effect.

<br />Well, there is at least one nerd for every game in the world. Even the crappy ones. Plus, this is tool-assisted, so it really doesn't count. =)
<br />
<br />I just noticed how much of the music in this game is interrupted by the sound effects. People should never let sound effects interrupt the primary melody like that!
<br />
<br />EDIT: Now that I look at it again, this game isn't very well programmed at all. Look at the BAD scrolling artifacts (which look even worse on a black background) on the second level. Also, the sprites seem to constantly get misaligned with the background as the camera moves... it's like they only compute the positions of things every other frame.

I think a lot of games from the NES's commercial era didn't automatically assign square wave sound effects between channels $4000 and $4004 like Tetramino does. Instead, they just hardcoded a channel for each sound effect, and if you wanted to play two sound effects at the same time, they had to be hardcoded for different channels, so one of them was more likely to interrupt the primary melody.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Now that I look at it again, this game isn't very well programmed at all.

<br />Running at less than 60 fps was typical of Micronics. But ghost-writer developers like Micronics and TOSE aren't the only guilty parties. Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 for Game Boy had serious sync problems between sprite scrolling and background scrolling, but nobody noticed it on the Game Boy's motion-blurry screen until Super Game Boy came out.

<br />Heh, I was just playing this game on my SGB to bring back memories and analyze its gameplay/graphics and wondered what the hell was going on.

Once you play it enough you learn lots of little tricks that make the game easy especially after you figure out how to kill a red demon correctly the games difficulty level spikes down. Almost every monster in the game has a very predictable pattern that can be countered once you know it. I can't even really look at this game as hard anymore though because after playing it for 2 days non stop I found that it's not actually that hard as most people make it out to be..
