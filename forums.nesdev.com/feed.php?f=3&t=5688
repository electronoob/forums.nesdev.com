The main thing to make it work, in the original question of the thread too, was just keeping track of when the registers are written.  You'd keep a copy of $4003 for example, and compare it to the old one, but also do something to the original location so you can tell when the same value is written repeatedly (even zeros).  I'm not sure how I handled it at the moment, but it's in that source.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also I now understand why it did work with so few of my works : The SNES CPU runs the code "as-it" without any emulation, and the host programm overwrites some zeropage locations.<br /></div><br /><br />Actually the 65C816 has the awesome ability to relocate zero-page to be any page, so I had multiple zero-pages.  But there were some problems, a real common thing was an emulated JMP ($0000), using the wrong page.  I hacked the NSFs, when I probably could've just rearranged the memory pages originally.  A few NSFs were filled with things like STA $0024 and were a lost cause on hacking.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />It would have been better (but much slower) to write a true emulator here.<br /></div><br /><br />On the SPC700 you mean?  It was pretty similar to the 6502, that'd be interesting.  I'm sure it'd be fast enough, for almost any play routines.  I don't see a big advantage over using the emulation mode of the SNES CPU, since NSFs don't use undocumented opcodes normally (if ever).<br /><br />You're definitely right about the sound samples, I'm sure it would sound better with a lower sample.  Originally I was thinking that the entire output was being filtered, but if it's gonna change with a different playback rate then it'll make a huge difference.<br /><br />I could have done the looped noise thing, but it was just laziness at that point since hardly anything used it (heh, but the intro screen music uses it).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sun Nov 01, 2009 1:06 pm</p><hr />

Hey it would be great to modify it as a NSF-&gt;SPC converter so you could litsen it as simple .spc<br />Also I now understand why it did work with so few of my works : The SNES CPU runs the code "as-it" without any emulation, and the host programm overwrites some zeropage locations. It would have been better (but much slower) to write a true emulator here.<br /><br />In the end the sound would be much better if a lower sample was used for square so it doesn't sound so muffled, and if a sample would be used for noise instead of noise.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Nov 01, 2009 10:09 am</p><hr />

Currently I'm uploading the binaries too so it'll finally have an actual distribution point.  I never put it on the Parodius server because of the filesize and the hundreds of copyright issues. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Oct 31, 2009 9:43 am</p><hr />

When a channel is enabled back, the lenght counters remains zero until some new value is written to $4003/$4007/$400b/$400f. The only change is that they're not forced to zero any longer.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Oct 29, 2009 10:04 am</p><hr />

Whan a channel is halted, the length counter is supposedly set to 0. The waveform counter itself is also halted from what I recall (so no sound output). What happens to the audio channels when they are re-enabled? If LC is enabled, is it reset to the original value written to it or does it take the last counter value used before being forced to 0, or does it just still remain at 0 until something other reg write enables it. The question for volume envelope (being it looping to decay) and also for sweep.<br /><br /> So basically, can $4015 be used to retrigger notes or to pause/unpause notes?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Tom<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3645">tomaitheous</a> — Thu Oct 29, 2009 9:05 am</p><hr />
