		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello! 
<br />Only today I connected to internet and I checking out my posts. 
<br />
<br />Hey! you're very rediculous. I'm laughing at you.
<br />If you really think this picture is "fake" then you nothing understand about nes hardwares.  
<br />Certainly, you are never seeing before such a nice debbugger. Because you think it's "fake screen shot". 
<br />Definatly you greedly wanted my nes superb debbuger and softwares. Unfortunatly that is not a free-ware if you really want this debbuger then you must buy it! Anyway!.
<br />I will release someday! Currently I dont have my own web site and I still have internet problems. 
<br />
<br />
<br />MottZilla or Monkeygorilla or GorZilla!!! and Lametroll!(Disch) seems all the same name. So, I ask you humble intellgent few questions.
<br />Because you wrote here ""debugger" picture looks like ass I'm so wonderful and awesome I could shit a better looking "debugger" than that"
<br />
<br />Q#1. Where did you see such a nice and superb ass?
<br />
<br />Q#2. Real awesome, real cool people never say such words "I'm awesome, I'm wonderful, I'm amazing talented...", they mostly very humble because they very well know what is true, what is false.
<br />Only real morons can say such words "I'm awesome..." because they don't know what they said. Main reason is they can't know what is true, what is false. 
<br />So, If you real awesome person then why did you shamelessly wrote here to bunch of people "I'm wonderful awesome amazing talented"!???.
<br />
<br />Q#3. This debbugger is 100% realistic nes hardware related! absolutely you can't make better debbugger even you can't find anywhere else!. 
<br />So, How could you make better than that "debbugger"??? Also, if you found better debbugger than mine then don't forget! to show me.
<br />
<br />Well, GorZilla!(MottZilla) and Lametrolls! if you can then prove them your amazing talents. And impress me. 
<br />If you can't prove then you must be an typical asshole and miserable creature!!!!!!! 
<br />
<br />
<br />By the way I'm never been jealous at someones job, if someone made a cool things I'll impress and proud him or her.
<br />Good luck. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First off, I've made my own NES emulator. It is available to anyone that cares to look at it to do so. Where is yours now? You just show pictures. 
<br />
<br />I'll show you better debuggers. Google for these little programs such as Nintendulator or FCEUXD. 
<br />
<br />Next I don't recall saying I was awesome or anything of that sort. Furthermore I don't give a shit if you like me or not. Also you brought this on yourself by saying look at my "perfect" NES debugger. You just said it's 100% realistic nes hardware or some crap. I don't remember Quietust making a thread about Nintendulator to wave his E-Penis at everyone saying look at my perfect NES emulator, btw you can't have it. 
<br />
<br />No one here is interested in impressing you or having you be proud of them. When you posted your picture you got the appropriate response for it. If you didn't like it that's too bad. The fact is the people around here aren't stupid. Why don't you go post on some forum that has members on the level of GameFaqs forums. I'm sure they'll believe your bullshit and all that. You'll fit right in. 
<br />
<br />And again, the picture of your "debugger" looks extremely amateurish. It looks nothing like what would be considered "useful" or even something that looks believable.

<br />Celius implied that you were acting inconsiderate; that's all.
<br />
<br />Celius: Could you explain the reasoning behind your request, in order to help this user not run into problems in the future?

<br />i just finished reattaching my balls after peeing all over them from laughing so hard after having them detatch from laughter.
<br />
<br />my debugger uses virtual reality to display a wall of every NES, Famicom, and demo game in existence updated in realtime and allows me to pull character data or any feature whatsoever from any of them USING THE LEFT-HANDED POWER GLOVE (with my new finger position sensors i fitted it with) and combine them limitlessly. it also displays the comprehensive annotated source code for any of them using a feature ripped from MottZilla's Mega debugger altered to scan parallel universes (all of whose games are also on the virtual wall).
<br />
<br />on a slightly more serious note, it would be cool to be able to stretch the window and output image files from the PPU and nametable viewers on one of the real emulators.
