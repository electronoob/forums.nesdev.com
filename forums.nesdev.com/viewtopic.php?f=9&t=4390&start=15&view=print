<br />If only the tiles were changed, yes. But most (good) graphic hacks include palette changes, tile mapping changes and so on, that require the PRG to be swapped too.

<br />it looks like from the pictures you wired it like this:
<br />
<br />bent up pins 1,2,24,31,32
<br />wired pin 1 to pin 16
<br />wired pin 24 to pin 22
<br />wired pin 2 to hole 24

<br />OK, I just got the cart. Yup, this is all correct.
<br />
<br />The only thing missing is pin 30 (A17), which was also bent to be connected to the mapping hardware. I don't know what the size of the PRG-ROM of your game is, but whatever address lines are not used should be connected to GND (like I did with pin 1).
<br />
<br />Also, keep in mind that this cart was made for an AT29C040 Flash ROM, as you can see in the pictures. If your chip is different, just look at the datasheets of both chips to see how they differ from each other and make the proper adjustments.

<br />
<br />the prg is 128 kb, so i am using a 27c010 eprom chip.  it looks like they are very similar, except for pins 1, 30,31,32:

<br />what is PGM, NC, OE and CE?  I know what they stand for (No connect, Output enable, Chip enable, but dont understand them when it comes to rewiring.  like why do you wire A16 to OE?

<br />PGM is used for programming the chip, it has no use in a dev cart. I'm not sure if it should be connected to VCC or to GND (I've never used EPROMs), maybe someone can clear this up.
<br />
<br />Output Enable and Chip Enable are used by the NES to activate and deactivate the chip depending on which parts of the memory are being accessed. The chip should only be active when the address is between $8000 and $FFFF. When other addresses are accessed, other chips are enabled instead (such as WRAM when $6000-$7FFF is accessed). Only one chip can output data at a time, or else the resulting data would be useless (bus conflicts).
<br />
<br />Note that I DIDN'T wire A16 to OE. Take a look at the <a href="http://nesdev.com/NES%20ROM%20Pinouts.txt" class="postlink">pinouts of the Nintendo ROMs</a> and you'll see what each hole is for. Hole 24 is clearly A16. That is the whole purpose of bending pins up: avoiding them to get in contact with the wrong holes, while the wires connect them to the correct holes on the other side of the board.
