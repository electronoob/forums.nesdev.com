		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Today I figured out a way to determine the NTSC NES video waveform without having to get an oscilloscope. I was able to underclock my NES by replacing the 21 MHz crystal with a 3.6 MHz crystal, then use my PC's video capture in grayscale mode as a high-speed waveform digitizer. My NES actually ran OK (I could still use my devcart, but with the serial running at 1/6 the normal rate). I measured the video waveform fairly reliably and put those values into my NTSC emulator. This is how a test palette and Super Mario Bros. display with it:

<br />
<br />I still need to measure the effect of the emphasis bits, then check things over and post updated NTSC emulator code (the changes are slight, just involving the table initialization). I'm excited about finishing this.

<br />Also, did you use signal clamping for that screenshot, or did the 3x colors turn out that way by themselves? Or do the 3x colors really have a different amplitude than the rest? Because if they do, the 2C02 document (which claims equal amplitude throughout all colors) would need updating.
<br />
<br />Of course, if we understand emulation also as a hardware-documentation project (the way MAME does), we won't be satisfied with the bare values, but instead understand how these values come about (resistor ladder etc.).
<br />
<br />Thanks for doing these tests. Now it should be possible do get an emulated video output that matches standard as well as current NTSC tv sets 100%. The last video frontier to conquer is find out about the exact non-standard behavior of Japanese 80's tv sets, thus getting all the color nuances as the original programmers intended.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />Here, I made a <a href="http://www.lau-net.de/~nl2305/Blargg.pal" class="postlink">.PAL file</a> from Blargg's screenshot. Note that this screenshot is at a hue knob setting of minus 15 or so degrees. If you compare this with a "video-essentials" calibrated TV (hue knob at +/- zero degrees, no hue change), it'll be a little bit more greenish.

This gave me excellent digitizations of the waveforms, without any annoying filtering. Here is an example at full resolution of colors $0F, $30, $06, $16, $0F, $26, $36, $30 (the square waves are at the 3.5 MHz colorburst frequency):

<br />These are the relevant results so far, the luma amplitudes and chroma sine wave amplitudes. These are close to what I made before, but I correct an error on my part of using the chroma square wave amplitude directly without adjusting by 1.27 (to get the amplitude of the fundamental sine wave). I updated the previous pictures to reflect this. <strong>See note at end of message</strong>

<br />Maybe I should remove that, so people don't prematurely go using it as a "correct" palette (espcially since it was wrong, due to the sine/square wave error mentioned above). People, all that's reliable here are the raw NTSC video waveform values. The images above are with my (somewhat crappy) NTSC emulator. That will be the next thing that gets polished up.
<br />
<br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Re-adjusted chroma amplitudes back to same values as square waves (i.e. no 1.27 factor anymore), as per later discussion.

So the <em>unfiltered</em> NES signal stays within video levels, but after a low-pass it can go above. This leaves the TV an opportunity to do further clamping that could affect the image.
<br />
<br />As for absolute level, I did some rough comparisons (digitize normal video signal and compare levels) and it seems that $0F and $30 roughly match the black and white levels of my video camera (cheap Sony Handycam). Is there anything special to take this into account? I figure the absolute DC level of the signal only affects the luminance.
<br />
<br />I'll try to measure the video signal outside the active area, but it's kind of hard because I can't get a clean uninterrupted sample of data. What I'm currently doing is feeding the 1/6 speed NES video signal to the capture card and supplying a separate video signal to another input for synchronization. This means that for each field I get a series of 240 blocks, each 640 samples, with around 160 samples delay between each block. At 1/6 the rate, 640 samples only gets a small part of the NES scanline. I don't see any way to tell the card to digitize data uninterrupted.
<br />
<br />I've checked a few more things. The colorburst is at the same phase as color $x8. I'm almost done with emphasis. It's pretty simple as far as the effect on the raw waveform, but I'll have to do some Fourier analysis to determine the effective color phase and saturation since it causes non-50% duty waveforms.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, I was able to do scanline timing by timing how much of the signal is blanked out and having my digitizer program insert zero samples there to compensate. The time units are PPU clocks.

<br />
<br />Here is the raw waveform. I filled the screen with solid tiles of color $30 and set the background to color $0D (so you could see the difference between background and black fill). Note how the digitizer is adjusting the gain/offset periodically, making absolute level measurements useless for this sample. Only use it for timing.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.io.com/~greens/temp/ntsc_scanline.wav" class="postlink">ntsc_scanline.wav</a>
<br />
<br />Regarding the absolute video levels, ignore everything I've said so far. I've noticed that the card is doing some kind of adjustment of the digitizer's range based on the signal, so I can't do meaningful comparisons between separate signals. I'll have to come up with some other way (like quickly switching in a fixed voltage source while digitizing).
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm not sure you should do that in the NES video encoder, because that will adversely affect the luma artifacts as well.</div>
<br />
<br />If the encoder is generating the <em>filtered</em> signal, it seems it must output the sine wave component of the square wave. The only way to avoid this translation is to generate the signal at many times the normal video bandwidth (which is admittedly the correct thing to do, since that would handle the chopped-off edges between pixels properly). We'd need some more optimization talent to make that work in real-time.
<br />
<br />I found that same page for square wave levels. I'm assuming the latter quote "and the amplitude of the sine wave output will be approximately 87 percent of the peak of the square wave" refers to the output of the filter/amplifier described. Try it yourself; if you want to generate a square wave of amplitude 1.0 from sine waves, you'll have to incorporate a 1.27 factor somewhere. Am I correct that the only effect this issue has is on the color saturation? If so, then I'll trust your end-result comparisons.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Updated timing table to be in PPU clocks (duh!).

<br />
<br />If you've got a square wave at 3.579545 MHz (colorburst), then it's got a harmonic at 10.74 MHz, another at 17.90 MHz, etc. These are way beyond a video signal, so I'd expect a TV to remove them at some point. If they are removed, then the remaining sine wave at ~3.58 MHz will have an amplitude higher than you might expect, because the harmonics were canceling its peak somewhat.
<br />
<br />Hmmm, I just realized that by running my NES at 1/6 its normal speed, any internal video filtering will behave differently. So I guess this puts the clamping issue into bigger doubt. On the bright side, that means I'm effectively measuring the signals before internal filtering, which might help map it out. I'll have to measure the video signal once I've put the original oscillator back in my NES. This digitizer doesn't filter the signal so I'll be able to still see the chroma signals and find if they're clamped. Argh, sorry for these confusions due to my setup. That's why I post the details so you can scrutinize my conclusions.
<br />
