I'm a newbie here so hello. Anyway I thought I've done a good rewireing job but I only get scrabled graphics. <br />I'll try to give all info.<br />I took one of my own games Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles II - The Arcade Game (pal-B) having the MMC3B board trying to rewire it for eproms.<br />Eproms of use is 27C020. To test the art of splitting roms I retrieved a copy of my own game (the above). Splitted it to CHR 256Kb and PRG 256Kb. <br />I burned them with a willem PCB 5.0E board and the burner program 098D8.<br />To mention I checked the eproms that they  where blank and the program did automatic "verify" test. Both CHR and PRG came out good. At least what the program said. <br />Now something I've done is good since there is a graphic at all but there is defenitly something wrong since it's not working properly.<br />Question is where is the fault. Any one believe its the burning process? <br />It's not dirty pins, I've cleaned them good. Or do you believe it's the wiring.<br />If it's the wiring how can I check the MMC3 board with a multimeter. <br />Have no idea what pins should have what reistance or so. Any help would be appreciated=)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5284">Matrix</a> â€” Thu May 03, 2012 4:11 pm</p><hr />
