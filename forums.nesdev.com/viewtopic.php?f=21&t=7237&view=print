		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Recently I had need for a tool that would allow me to create a tileset and nametable from a BMP file, and edit some other things. I've found few solutions which weren't fully worked for me by various reasons (NSA, p8nes), so I quickly made this Windows tool for my needs. Maybe it could be useful for someone else, so I release it to the public.
<br />
<br />It allows to import graphics from 16-color BMP file, edit and create nametables, attributes, palettes, and tile graphics. It has the features I've needed only. I may fix bugs and add some small features by request, but I don't have big plans on this tool.
<br />
<br />The tool is released into Public Domain, completely with source code, so you can use it any way you want. The source is not much help, though, because it is in Borland Turbo C++ Express, which is no more available for free, and is not portable, but anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cool! I'll be giving this a try.
<br />
<br />Couple of things immediately:
<br />
<br />+ A really handy feature which I've never seen in one of these editors before is the ability to 'paint' attributes/palettes on the nametable. Really nice <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />- I tried to load a .chr file that I'd made in YYCHR but your program wouldn't load it because it says a .chr file must be 4096 bytes. How come? The one created in YYCHR is only 2048 and looking at your tileset window you only have space for 256 tiles (same as YYCHR) so I'd have thought the resulting .chr file would be 2048, the same as YYCHR?
<br />
<br />Edit to add: ah, it seems that the YYCHR files are actually 8192 bytes - I never realised that before. I guess it saves out a 4k CHR/4K SPR file? In that case, your tool is correct <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tend to work on 4k files anyway (CHR and SPR separate), I just never realised that YYCHR creates an 8K file by default. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I loaded up the CHR file for my latest project and messed around editing the nametable. I really like it, especially the inclusion of RLE. That's a really nice touch. Going to have a play importing BMPs because that sounds cool.
<br />
<br />One quick thing that would be nice is if you could make the CHR editor open if you double-click a tile in the tile set (of course, it should open with the tile you click <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)
<br />
<br />Great work Shiru. I'm going to have a look at the source too. I'd love to be able to port it to OSX (I'm using it via a VM at the moment, same as YYCHR so it's not a problem really)
<br />
<br />As for new feature, if you have the time and inclination to do so;
<br />
<br />+ more editing functions for the nametable such as copy/paste/cut would be really handy I think
<br />
<br />+ more advanced editing would be the ability to insert/delete a row/column in the nametable (when I need to do this with YYCHR I end up just loading the nametable into a hex editor <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)

<br />
<br />Couple of bugs / feature requests:
<br />- when I imported a BMP the surfaces weren't re-painted until I pressed a button (Show grid)
<br />- maybe change the grid so that it displays 16x16 (attrib areas) with solid lines and subdivides that to 8x8 with dotted lines (or equivalent)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was going to say the same about the grid (16 x 16) but I'd also suggest drawing all the grid lines in dots. Your tool seems to suffer the same problem as YYCHR in that it uses one of the palette colours to draw the grid so depending on what you're putting on the nametable, the grid lines can be 'invisible'.

<br />Could you also have it remember the last folder/path you accessed so that when you reopen the program you don't have to navigate from the folder where NESST resides?
