It's looking grim that I'll be able to read this via copynes so I yanked the ROM and read it directly (matches Gluk), also /CE must be normal, because I didn't have to jump it to VCC to read it. Only had to mess with A16 being non-standard.<br /><br />I hate to throw in the towel before fully understanding what's going on, but the game is dumped now and I've spent enough time on this as it is.

Ok, I tried a few different capacitors, it didn't seem to have an effect. Connecting CHR /RD directly pin 19 did make a significant improvement, it completely got rid of the "zero pages", but the tiles were still glitching, and this time also in render mode. I tried jumping it with a cap (forget exactly what I tried, it was ballpark of the 561 though).<br /><br />I think the glitching now is the same between rendering and reading from 2007, so if one was able to correct it, I think it would be both playable and readable via copynes.<br /><br />It appears that on piteta's gluk cart, CHR /RD is also directly connected to pin 19 with nothing in between.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Sat Oct 30, 2010 4:58 pm</p><hr />

Although, if the game can manage to work as is, certainly copynes should be able to read it somehow without having to modify the cart, wouldn't you agree?<br /><br /></div><br /><br />Nope, the access pattern is different between the PPU rendering, and manually via prodding 2007.  The 2007 pattern is longer than the rendering pattern.  Both are run by separate state machines.<br /><br />The two state machine control signals are simply OR'd together, so bad stuff can happen if you write during rendering.  You can trigger the case where the PPU is both reading AND writing at the same time, in fact both /RD and /WR go low!<br /><br />The whole point of this is 2007 vs. rendering are two very different sets of conditions on the CHR bus so it's possible that it would act different.  Interesting that that happened because this is the first case of that being an issue.<br /><br />Because a 2007 read takes longer, maybe the pulse has to be longer too, to compensate (note: the cart may not run properly any more in render mode but will in 2007 read mode).<br /><br />HEYYYY what's this?<br /><br />why, it's "Fighting hero" by ntdec!  I found I have a cart with the TC-112 on it too.  There's 4 chips on this board.  And interestingly enough, there's no capacitor.<br /><br />the chips are marked:  ND946-P-UN (prg),  ND947-C1 (CHR), and ND947-C2-V (CHR) and of course TC-112.<br /><br />the PCB is marked "TH2219-2" if that helps.  Let me verify the pinout with yours real fast.<br /><br />changes:<br />pin 19 - directly connects to CHR /RD<br />pin 26 - connects to /CE on CHR ROM 2<br />pin 27 - connects to /CE on CHR ROM 1 (this is like your cart shown for clarity)<br />pin 34 is doubtlessly for a PRG ROM which would map first (you always want the first rom in the uppermost bank so pin 35 has to be ROM2)<br /><br /><br />soo maybe you can try bypassing the 7400 circuit all together and run /RD directly into pin 19 like on this board.  can't hurt I guess.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Sat Oct 30, 2010 2:54 pm</p><hr />
