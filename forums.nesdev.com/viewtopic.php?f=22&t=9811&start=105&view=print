But given Konami's release of the Castlevania and Contra compilation for PC, this isn't likely to pose a problem.

I've had two lawyers look it over and say the same thing. He also said that he didn't think that was in the spirit of the contract, but since the words of the contract quite literally actually do say that Sony owns it if there ever was a conflict you'd be sure they would use that against you and you should not sign it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As far as I can tell, you still may be able to do something which isn't normally allowed by the Ouya contract as long as the program isn't distributed on Ouya, for example if it is on PDROMS. Of course this may not be suitable for many purposes, but it exists in case someone does need to do that, for example if someone makes some open-source NES/Famicom emulator for Ouya that can load external ROM images, it may be distributed on something else and the user will need to know how to install external software (although I believe documentation for doing this is provided, although it is probably more difficult than installing official software anyways, but I suppose that's OK).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry guys. Sony says the terms of the contract are non-negotiable - even after climbing the ladder and talking directly to Adam Boyes who is the head of the indie department. I can't in good conscience support a console company whose motives are questionable. They seem extremely anti-indie friendly the moment you step out of the PR and into reality. Their contract has many statements of varying 800 pound gorilla tactics severity, and I simply can't put my company and ultimately my family at risk for the sake of EMUya. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">All Next Gen Materials, all inventions and developments that utilize or incorporate Next Gen Materials and any derivatives of Next Gen Materials are the sole property of SCEA</div><br /><br />That means that anything we ship on the PS4 Sony owns (including your games maybe even). There are also terms in the contract which will quite literally bankrupt myself for life would worst cases (which are not impossible by any stretch) happen. <br /><br />On the up side, Amazon is releasing a console this year as well. Their console is much more open, so I intend to ship EMUya on it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
