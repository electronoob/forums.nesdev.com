		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can confirm that the glitches are due to DPCM samples. I added a folder to the Dropbox on the first post, which has a .NES rom and the User Configure.asm (Disclaimer: none of the songs used are my work, all have been DLed from FT Fourm). To test, I edited a FTM file and exported the song with two versions, one with DPCM (NSF #3 &amp; #6) and the other (NSF #4 &amp; #7) without. As soon as the Samples start playing it triggers a bankswitch (triggers a false 'Right' button).<br />   SO... it's good that I know what the problem is; now just got to work out a better controller read routine.<br />   Thanks for all the input, this helped alot!<br />Yogi<br /><br />PS the first two NSF in the ROM are a test of FT's engine speed custom setting. One at 60Hz and the other at 30Hz playback.

As built, it assumes 128KB Eprom, but can be expanded without too much work. Let me know your Eprom target size.<br />   The kernel and NMI code resides in the last 8K bank, so max NSF size is 24K, starting at $8000. <br />  The docs are 'lacking' and out of date, but the code is commented (excessively). If you have the time to read through the code, should be able to get the gist.<br />  I'll clean it a bit and do a 'quick start' guide (not too different from VegaPlay) and zip it up.

The CHR data, Reset and a part of the NMI code are in two 8K banks (we lose 16K for these). During the NMI the bulk of the controller read and logic code is banked back in. When we are ready to play the next frame, we jump to the NMI code in the fixed bank and the current NSF banks are restored and we JSR to the play address and then exits the NMI. <br />   Banking of NSFs is done with 3 - 8K banks at a time, each of these 24K blocks contain an NSF. So with a 128K rom this allows 4 NSFs, 3 at 24K and the last at 31K max. This is all based on a 128K device, with a 256K you could have 7.<br />  My Fixed bank code is less than 200 bytes at the top of mem, so the last NSF can overlap onto the lower part of this fixed bank.<br /><br />With the MMC1 that I have been working on, all of the runtime code is in WRAM and during normal play, NSF banking is done with 32K blocks. During a reset, the MMC switches to 16K banking, that makes the Reset code visible in the top 16K bank. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> Would be something like this:<br /><br />VRC6:<br />0x8000-0xBFFF -&gt; Song data banking<br />0xC000-0xDFFF -&gt; DPCM data banking<br />0xE000 -&gt; Song driver and VegaPlay<br /><br />VRC7:<br />0x8000-0x9FFF -&gt; Song data banking<br />0xA000-0xBFFF -&gt; Song data banking<br />0xC000-0xDFFF -&gt; DPCM data banking<br />0xE000 -&gt; Song driver and VegaPlay </div><br /><br /> Your approach does give you tight control over the placement of song data and would work well for album production. How difficult is the preparation process for the song data? Hand editing of the raw data? If it can be automated with a script that would help users.<br />  I wanted to maintain the VegaPlay NSF structure; many users of VegaPlay are more interested is making music and less knowledgeable about NES kernels. It has it's downside, wasteful of the space and dependent on the Export routine's default memory usage, but for a musician it's far less complicated.  <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> My current target size is 256KB/256KB.

The idea is to implement the two VRC7 sound addresses and just the first banking register address at $8000. All banking would be in 24K blocks. It would be compatible with VRC7 NSFs and the VegaPlay code I have; just no 8K banking. I got it mostly prototyped but not tested yet. Kind of went on the back burner till I get the MMC project done.<br />Yogi

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I commented about the YM2413, because the small chip in the middle of the board happens to be a YM2413 which is connected to 0x9010/0x9030 and receives the same writes as the VRC7 FM core. It's operating properly and produces music without distortion or wrong sounding notes. (save the rom patches being different)<br /><br />The 74LS138 is there to provide decoding for the YM2413 enable. It does leech it's clock from the VRC7 crystal oscillator. <br /><br />The 555 timer IC is there as a &quot;missing pulse detector&quot;, which monitors the phy2 signal. That provides a proper power on reset for the YM2413 and when phy2 stops changing states, YM2413 reset is held high, stopping the sound completely.<br /><br />So the connection of YM2413 to the NES/Famicom is a non issue atm.

(Looks like ~$28 instead of ~$35)</div><br />   I knew it used the VRC7 mapper but does it have a functional FM core? I remember seeing some discussion and guesses on if it can do expo sound but didn't think anyone had done it. It does seems likely that they would use the same chip but...  <br />   At ~$30 without an adapter, it does sound much better.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">All banking would be in 24K blocks.<br /></div>How would 24K blocks work? Specify an offset as a multiple of 8 KiB? Multiply by 3? 32 KiB where the top 8 KiB is concealed?</div><br /><br />   You're right, 32K banks (been awhile since I reviewed the sch) With the bulk of the kernel in WRAM and some bytes in each bank lost to the reset vectors and bankswitch trampoline. One bank loses the space for the CHR data and Reset code. We still end up with 7 30-31K banks and one 18-20K on a 256K device.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">
