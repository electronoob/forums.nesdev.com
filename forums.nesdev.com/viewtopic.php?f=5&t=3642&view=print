<br />
<br />I know this is an NES board, but I don't know of a good Sega Genesis forum and most of you are well versed in other systems, so I'll ask anyway.
<br />
<br />OK, as I'm sure you know, there are 3 versions of the Sega Genesis
<br />My question is, which do you think is the best in terms of the following criteria:
<br />
<br />Reliability: pin connector works good, no known sudden failures (I imagine all would be the same, but you never know)
<br />
<br />Compatability:  I know only the first gen was compatible with master system games, so that one is looking like my first choice, but were there any other compatability issues with the Sega CD and 32X with the first or third models?
<br />
<br />Quality:  Which one feels the most solidly built and would last for years to come?
<br />
<br />Price: which one would likely be the cheapest, easiest to find?
<br />
<br />Picture/Sound: do all generations use A/V outs? are some RF only? Do some have a slightly faster processor to prevent slowdown?
<br />
<br />Ease of assembly/disassembly: I plan on taking it completely apart and cleaning every nook and cranny, so I don't want a system with 6 million screws and be impossible to put back together
<br />
<br />As far as I know right now, the advantages to each are as follows:
<br />
<br />Gen 1: master system backwards compatability
<br />Gen 2: easiest to attach Sega CD and 32X
<br />Gen 3: most compact to fit in an entertainment center among other systems
<br />
<br />So, please, give me your thoughts and opinions if you are well versed with the Sega Genesis.  I saw a generation 2 Genesis at my local Play n Trade for $25 and it seemed like a good price (pretty sure complete with 1 controller, no box of course).  The only problem is that it was really dusty/dirty and I would have to take it apart to clean the gunk out of the console and controller for both functionality and aesthetics.

I think this was an inherent flaw in that model, and had to get one of the originals to get clean audio. At the very least, be sure you can check the audio first.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well, I've looked into it some more, the Genesis 3 is out because its usually the most expensive and isn't compatible with Sega CD or 32X.  The first Gen requires special adapters to fit the Sega CD and 32X, but at the same time the "HD" (early version) supposedly was the best of the game players.  The second gen is the cheapest and most common and easiest to attach the Sega CD and 32X to, so I don't know which route to go.  I guess Gen 1 is really best, but it could be tough to actually find one complete and in good shape and then be able to get adapters for 32X and Sega CD.  Any more input is welcome though.

<br />Anywho, I really enjoy my Genesis I because I can easily get stereo sound out of it.  Also the whole sounding better thing, though I never looked *too* deeply into it.  For video I usually just grab a stripped RCA cable &amp; tape it in there...

<br />
<br />Model 1 and 2 are entirely compatible with each other, so it only comes down to your style preference.
<br />
<br />I like both a lot but there's always something desirable about the original model, the "true" model. Sega CD model 2 is more reliable however and looks pretty sleek with a Genesis model 2. Model 1 + Sega CD + 32X is a pretty laughable sight though not as bad as Mega Drive 1 + Mega CD 1 + Super 32X + Mega Karaoke + Mega Modem + Multitap + copier :)
<br />
<br />The way I see it:
<br />Model 1 + Sega CD 1 = collector's set
<br />Model 2 + Sega CD 2 = gamer needing reliability/collector with modern taste
<br />Model 3 = undiscerning aftermarket gamer

<br />I have the first one, for some 15 years already, and it works just as well as the first time I ever used it. And it did fall and hit the floor a few times in the past, when I was a sloppy kid. I just had to buy some new controllers eventually. It has A/V out (using a special connector, not hard to find or build) and the stereo output with volume control on the front (something some of the later models lacked). Never hooked it to a Sega CD, 32X or Master system adapter, so I can't say how well it works with those.

I didn't realize there were 2 versions of Sega CD, which one is more common?  What were the problems with the 1st gen Sega CD?  And, finally, which is the most common combo (because thats the one I'll seek out, I'm not trying to find the "Stadium Events" equivalent of Sega Genesis)?

I'm not aware of any issues with the Sega CD 1, apart from the fact that it is a CD unit, and they all stop functioning at some point. Maybe more 1st gen models have problems because they are older.

<br />
<br />Sega CD 1 is a front loading system (which at the time meant a mechanical CD tray), so naturally there's lots of moving parts to break. Generally a broken Sega CD 1 means a broken tray mechanism.
<br />
<br />I've bought many of both CD models from flea markets and from my experiences Sega CD 2 are at least twice as likely to work without needing any repair.

Like I said before, is the model 1 genesis not compatible with the model 2 sega CD or model 2 with model 1 sega CD? They may not stack up or whatever but would they still function together?  What is the primary cause of failure for a Sega CD if it is properly cared for (not dropped/kicked/thrown around) and kept reasonable clean (no gunk to clog up moving parts and motors)?  That way, when I go to buy one I can check on it to see if its going to give me trouble, and then I know not to bother or to haggle since I'll need to repair it.

Despite it's bulky case it doesn't feel sturdy at all, I would expect it to break if it fell 2 ft to a solid floor. I'm pretty sure you could throw off the tray mechanism if you just shook it vigorously (even if the tray is closed.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">17daysolderthannes wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Like I said before, is the model 1 genesis not compatible with the model 2 sega CD or model 2 with model 1 sega CD?

<br />You can use either model Sega CD with either model Genesis. The Genesis 1 will not wholly fit onto the Sega CD 2 though without an additional piece of plastic. In the Japanese version of the Sega CD 2, this piece is included, I'm not sure about the US model. Another thing to consider is that if you're getting a used 32X, it's difficult to get the Genesis 1 patch cable.
<br />
<br />After the CD mechanism, probably the next likely cause of failure is the voltage regulator (from using an inappropriate power supply.) I've only bought one Sega CD 1 and one Sega CD 2 with a bad regulator though.
