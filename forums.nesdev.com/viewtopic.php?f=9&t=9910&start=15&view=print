Hard real time would be being able to juggle continuous activity on both, which basically requires hardware assistance in the form of â‰ˆDMA or USB hardware.<br /><br />I did speak too hyperbolically: there are clear workarounds, such as time-sharing. They have their own trade-offs, of course.

Use that to prove why your choices are better vice trash talking someone else and a inanimate data communication protocol who isn't listening.  <br /><br />I'm also curious where one can buy a PC with a user JTAG port...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I did speak too hyperbolically: there are clear workarounds, such as time-sharing.

Even with the limitation of the NES waiting on the mcu while USB transfers are in progress doesn't seem like a significant loss to me.  In my use the data transfers are always initiated by the Host PC anyways.  If things are constantly streaming back and forth it would be a more penalizing draw back though.

This is a total misunderstanding.</strong><br /><br />Then, yes I am upset about the usage of parallel port, yes, for the simple reason it's hard to find PCs with them, and if you find a PC with one, it's <em>extremely</em> hard to make it work.<br /><br />Under any Windows more recent than 98 (and who still uses 98...) you need the special .dll files to have any hope to acess the LPT, and even then it will randomly fail because your motherboard is form brand X instead of brand Y, etc...<br /><br />The reason why I reacted so was because of my last attempt at using a parallel port to communicate with the Commodore-64 disk drive to test my programs developed on my PC on my C64. <strong>This ended up being a complete waste of time because nothing worked at all and all transfer programs were dating from 1992 or so, and were completely unusable as of the 200X years.</strong> This is where my hatred towards parallel ports comes from. Eventually I was able to use a fake tape cassette in order to download data from the sound jack of my PC, works flawlessly. It can't write disks but at least it's a simple and reliable way to download a program into the C64 from a PC.<br /><br />Now if someone can proof me otherwise that it's easy to access to PCs which are more recent than 2000 and have parallel port, and that access them with Windows 7 (or even XP), or any common Linux distro, without reinventing the wheel and rewrite your own OS/Kernel/Drivers yourself, then I'm all ears.<br /><br />Yes USB is complicated to use and yes it's not easy, however at least it's modern and widely supported. You can get microcontrollers with embedded USB interfaces, or a regular microcontroller with software support of USB with open source and free software available on the internet. I used such a program once at my work, so I know it is possible, and on a tiny AVR micro with only 8 pins !<br />Thanks to interrupt they can both listen to USB and do something else at the same time if programmed right.<br /><br />Of course I'd do such a device myself if I could the problem is that the timing from the FDS drives are a total mystery for me and I have no hope of doing it right.<br />In the end I am very glad for Chris's hard work and I hope it will be useful for me one day, but as long as you can't get rid of the LPT, I can't see myself successfully using it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I initially bought a &quot;USB to Parallel&quot; adapter and ended up with one of those useless printer-only cables. Then I bought a parallel port card but it turned out not to work with my motherboard. A few months ago I bought a second one that I think should work, but I haven't felt like taking my PC apart to install it yet.<br /><br />It's probably convenient to work with from a hardware perspective once you have it going, but I do think it's an extremely inconvenient thing to get working. In general I prefer to use my laptop, and there's really no hope of doing anything parallel port there.

But Windows XP (32 Bit !) has been a lot of trouble and I have not gotten it to work.<br />To do all this I used the OpenCBM software which was last updated in 2007 if the website is not telling lies.<br />I also tried to write cassette tapes but had no luck. Not on Windows, not on Linux, not on a different computer. I don't know whether it's the programs, the tapes or the datasette device or something else. It just never worked.<br />The computer I used was built from single parts and not bought as a complete machine. By today's standards it is nothing great with a single core CPU and only 1.5GB of RAM. And unfortunately it broke on me last year.<br /><br />I have been looking for alternatives and found the SD2IEC device which consists of a microcontroller that transfers data from an SD card to the C64 or vice versa via the seriell connection.<br />It's not any faster than the floppy drive is (except if you use speedloaders...had bad luck with those). But it is very convenient and actually really easy to build yourself if you don't want to import it from somewhere.<br />By the way if anyone knows of something similar (inexpensive, easy to build and use) for the Atari ST, please let me know!<br /><br />So yeah, now that I don't have access to a parallel port anymore I also find it annoying if modern electronics projects rely on it.<br />But honestly instead of having to put microcontrollers in every device I'd rather have my parallel port back. And while we're at it: I don't have a serial port either and I have not seen computers with serial connections in a while...same with the gameport or PS/2 connectors. And we could go further with IDE, Floppy controllers or even ISA cards.<br />But I also really don't like these USB to MIDI converters, because I often have notes getting stuck on a channel or a lot of latency. And my serial to USB converter and PS/2 to USB converter never really worked.<br /><br />So what is my point on this? I'd like to be able to use both the old and the new connections! It becomes considerably harder especially with complete PCs or laptops. You really have to look for parts that allow you to use those older interfaces with success. What I found was usually really expensive because it was aimed at industries and not consumers or it was just incredibly outdated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's funny because it seems that everything that works for you don't for me and vice-versa. I have a MIDI &lt;-&gt; USB adapter wich works great. The only problem is if you're plugging it in and out while the PC is active, but as long as you don't touch the connexion it works flawlessly. I didn't even to install a driver for it !<br /><br />And yes you are right that modern PCs doesn't have serial ports any longer, and that no new design should rely on them. I just have the impression they disappeared only recently while the parallel ports have been gone for a looooong time.<br />I think many PCs still have PS/2 ports surprisingly. I use them on desktop stations to save USB ports for better usage (I never have enough USB ports !).<br /><br />Also usually PS/2 -&gt; USB adapter are passive. Don't ask my why this works, but sometimes it does. Probably only if they were shipped by the same manufacturer. It's possible they simply use USB protocol trough the PS/2 port, and that some kind of multiplexer comes afterwards that can detect if it's a true PS/2 peripheral, or their USB peripheral with an adapter. It's just speculation.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I share most of bregalad's feelings, because I too had a lot of problems with parallel ports. Many years ago I tried really (really!) hard to find a motherboard that still had a parallel port built in, and when I did I simply couldn't get anything to work with it. Tried every mode and every suggestion I found online but it was no use. Even the PC I had before that, which had a working parallel port, wasn't exactly what you'd call reliable. My Willem programmer for example would randomly refuse to be detected.<br /><br />I haven't seen a parallel port in a while now, and that doesn't bother me a bit. All game/hobby devices I currently own have USB connections, and I have no problems with them. I don't plan on buying anything that needs a parallel port ever again.
