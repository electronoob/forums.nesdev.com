		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was curious if anyone had some insight on to these things, such as, if I'm to power a max 12v screen and 5v NES I obviously would wanna account for the form factor of removal batteries and it's impact on the device so I'd like to go with something internal like a nice rechargable Li-ion battery so people aren't dealing with buying removable Li-ion batteries or shoving in a mega load of NiHM batteries to get it up to 12v. I see some 6500-mAH to 9600mAH Li-Ion recharable battery packs with both output and input to charge. Would these be adequate to power up both the screen and the NES? They have the protection circuit built in (obviously since these are packed up batteries with an input). I was thinking, I could route the power two directions, 12v for the screen and 5v for the NES, now with a regulator for the 12v I'd need MORE than 12v. Could I just feed the power directly to the screen since it meets specs? (pending the screen can't handle less than 12v, I'll find out soon). If the screen can do less than 12v and the NES does 5v, would be it feasible that the system would be able to handle this single battery? I'm thinking this is ideal if the max mA used is probably no more than 1000mA (350mA for the NES?) then that leaves me with LOTS of cordless game play hours.<br /><br />Another question.. can these batteries be charged while the system is on and playing or does it automatically stop the battery from outputting while in charge mode?<br /><br />I was looking at this: <a href="http://www.dxsoul.com//product/1298a-12-6v-9800mah-rechargeable-li-ion-battery-w-us-plug-power-adapter-901227814#.U-ThvXVdWVM" class="postlink">http://www.dxsoul.com//product/1298a-12-6v-9800mah-rechargeable-li-ion-battery-w-us-plug-power-adapter-901227814#.U-ThvXVdWVM</a><br /><br />I was thinking the extra .6v on this battery would be desirable for any loss with diodes and what not so I could actually get the screen powered on and that is pending I can't feed it less than 12v, I didn't get a minimum voltage on the specs of the screen.. I'm thinking it may have an adequate minimum voltage which I'll test out once it gets here, since it's my first go at an NES portable I wanted to basically get a cheap screen in case I screw it up, then perhaps do another with a portable PSOne screen once I get comfortable with handling the cheaper one.<br /><br />Thanks everybody. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

There's no obvious reason why it would not support charging while passing power from the wall wart.
