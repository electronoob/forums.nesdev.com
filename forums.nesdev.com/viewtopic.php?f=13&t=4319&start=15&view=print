<br />The rule is already "Don't be a dick". But there's so much discussion about whether or not jargon has actually been a dick that I have trouble seeing the dickery itself.

<br />
<br />Just a random thought, I don't know how well it would work out, you could put a notice/rule that says that a mod can ban any member/delete any posts at will. Though that might result in disaster if a different moderator were to come about, I think Tepples wouldn't abuse this power. Just a thought.

<br />"For the avoidance of doubt", as one often sees in the terms of a contract. But then I guess "Don't be a dick" and "Your posts may disappear" cover that rule.

<br />Thank God.
<br />
<br />Now how about appointing a mod/admin that is willing and able to apply this rule?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my view, it's a question of whether any users regularly disrupt discussions in a similar way. Higher level than simple-to-define behavior. It's about the effect. The goal of most forums is to foster discussion on topics that interest most participants. Anything which skews it towards satisfying just a few participants must be dealt with. The obvious first approach is to talk to those doing the disruption so that they can see the effect and solve the problem on their own. Once that fails, more crude solutions are necessary.

<br />Were this any other messageboard, this idiot would have been banned more than a month ago.
<br />
<br />Enough is enough. I've had it with this bullsh!t. tepples, you're a really smart guy, but that's also your biggest flaw as a moderator--you can't turn the logic off when the need arises. We shouldn't have to make detailed lists explaining why this guy should be banned when it's clear as day that he's insulting and irritating the hell out of everyone. If you can't figure out for yourself what kinds of behavior are acceptable here, or take appropriate action when lines are repeatedly crossed, perhaps you should hand the keys over to someone who can.

It's obvious the owner of this thread only goal is to push the limit more and more and see "how far the rabbits holes goes".  This thread is doing more harm than good.
<br />
<br />Tepples, I do understand that you want to be impartial and in some way this is the right thing to do as a moderator, but because of this, it kind of stop you at the same time do your job properly.
<br />
<br />If you do have an issue regarding if an user should be banned or not then what I would suggest you is to pick a few active members of the boards that are willing to give their opinion and to vote on the issue. This way, it will be a group consensus.  So if most people opinion and vote are the same as yours you will be able to make a better decision.
<br />
<br />Are people willing to do this?  I don't mind to be a volunteer on this issue because I like this board and want to see more interesting discussion everyday.

If everyone here is all mad about a certain user insulting people and posting nothing productive, it is obvious that that user should be banned for the good of the board.
