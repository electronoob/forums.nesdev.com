What I like about the drac battle you can play it safe or take a chance.  It's really easy to just walk away from him and make the pillars spread out, then you can walk towards him and try to get some more hits in just before the big flame sprouts.  And the cross makes it even faster.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3506">strat</a> — Wed Nov 25, 2009 5:06 pm</p><hr />

Today I finally beat Akumajou Densetsu.  Dracula was actually a whole lot easier than the game made it look.  It is possible to dodge the pillars of flame.  The final battle was harder than it was in the first game of the series, especially because you have to start at the beginning of the stage when you get game over.  Luckily, the Japanese version still starts you outside Dracula's keep in between lives.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3959">naI</a> — Sun Nov 22, 2009 6:18 pm</p><hr />

NESDS runs fine Castlevania 3, exept in vertical scrolling parts where candles and enemies are invisible which is QUITE annoying.<br /><br />And yeah that's what I said, if you have holy water death is a piece of cake (since he's basically frozen by it), else you can consider him impossible to beat. The problem is that it's very hard to make it in the boss room with holy water in your inventory.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Nov 16, 2009 9:52 am</p><hr />

I had time today to try Castlevania on the train. I started to feel rusted when I arrived at the 3rd stage but after a few try I was fine. Then got stuck again a little bit with Frankenstein but was fine again.<br /><br />Finally the grim.  Took a few time, tried with the cross or axe but I decided to try it finally with the holy water this time.  I was able to get there with x3. For some reason,  I decided to throw water before he shows up. I don't know if it's a glitch or because I played it inside an emulator, he stayed there without throwing any projectile at all.  I think the projectiles were frozen on top of him. In the previous try (cross/axe), there was projectiles everywhere. I just spammed him with water and he died without a single projectile thrown.<br /><br />Now I'm at the last level.  I use save state at the beginning of the stage only since I cannot play it in one shot (no time) but never use them for restoring in the middle of a stage. No rewind too. If I die, I restart from beginning, like if it was the real thing.  I guess I should be able to finish it back again soon. I just requires to learn back the patterns. Once you know them, the game is not that hard actually.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I won't be able to do the same with Castlevania 3 since the emulator on DS doesn't support it if my memory is good.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Mon Nov 16, 2009 9:38 am</p><hr />

CV3 rewards practice because the hard parts are less random, although the falling block room was way unnecessary.  The Dracula fight is great since you can use a lot of different tactics and it's nowhere near as monotonous.<br /><br />I'm with Angry Videogame Nerd on CV2.  Great when it's a real Castlevania game, lousy for the quest stuff.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3506">strat</a> — Tue Oct 27, 2009 9:41 am</p><hr />
