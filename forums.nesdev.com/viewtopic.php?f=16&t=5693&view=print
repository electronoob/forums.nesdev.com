<br />I think it's a great idea.  This way we can find more easily who is working on what. This is a lot easier than trying to find through the forum.

<br />I already added one of my project there. I invite everyone to do the same since it's a nice initiative.

<br />
<br />Ok then. I will add access to upload pictures to people that made their personal project page on the wiki already (Sivak, Miau, Durda Dan).  Any future project, people just request me by PM and I will take care of adding you to the upload group.
<br />
<br />Since it's based on a trust system, if there is any abuse of it, I will first remove access to the abuser. If the abuse become too much, I will revert back to the original procedure (i.e. admin only can upload) but I will be surprised that I will have to do that. The nesdev community is usually not like that.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />Sivak, Miau and Durda dan can now upload pictures on the wiki.

<br />
<br />I think so too. It may give a little boost to people that make some home brew project by giving them some exposure through the wiki. It's a lot easier now to find about a specific project than trying to search through the archive of the nesdev BBS. It was a simple but very good idea.

<br />Yes, I saw it while you where editing your page <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> I was editing a few things here and there. There is only one thing thought not related to CLR.  On the mystic pillar page, the * for list items doesn't show at all. I don't know if it's an HTML bug with my browser or what.
<br />
<br />By the way, the project page is not limited to software only: I encourage people with hardware project, commercial or not, to make a page about it. This mean the Powerpak, nes on FPGA, etc.  The wiki project section is for any kind of nes project, any.
