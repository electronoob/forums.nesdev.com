Now if we can just convince all those people that are hell bent on not using it because alcohol is "just fine" and then complain about the same thing.  :evil: But just make sure you wipe it off good. I clean up with water on the connector and dry that off. If you leave it on, I can imagine a bad residue would be present and not be good at all, just watch how it dries at the top of the bottle over time, and flakes off. But oh well, I'm sure you wiped it clean good.<br /><br />And also, I'd say the best way to clean it is a sturdy rag, 1/4th wet and the rest dry, so you don't have to switch between the different towels and have lots of cloth to get use with wiemans and then it's reuasable. Elbow pressure is sort of needed with the wiemans for bad cases, and you need a tough towel to get it all off.</div>

<br />Well bloody hell -- seems I've lost my 3.8mm NES cart bit, so I had to put in an order for another one.  Cleaning the carts without opening them up is possible, but it's really hard to get good pressure on the contacts without opening the carts.  I'll finish the cleaning video later once I have the bit in hand, and strongly advocate using it.
<br />
<br />In the process of making a mess tonight, though, I did manage to find that my Bubble Bobble cart wouldn't work before and after cleaning.  I was like "WTF?  What's with this one cart?"  Once I inspecting the cart pins I found that two on the far edge were corroded to hell (literally the gold was missing, maybe 1/4th of a contact left on both of them!).  I would have seen this instantly had I been able to just open the cart up and clean it normally.  :-(  Must buy replacement Bubble Bobble...
<br />
<br />Regarding rags/cleaning tools: I strongly advocate using <a href="http://www.mrclean.com/en_US/magic-eraser.do" class="postlink">Mr. Clean Magic Erasers</a> instead of a cloth rag.  The texture/surface of them is really fine, and they hold water/liquid quite well (so getting half a side of one damp and the other side dry is completely possible).  Not a lot of pressure is needed either; they do the work for you.  A box of 4 is about $8, and should last years for anyone with a decently-sized NES collection.  I've tried the erasers out, by the way, on my Bubble Bobble cart.  (Oh, and those erasers also can do crazy stuff like clean smudges off of painted walls, and do absolute miracles on the floor/surface of a bathtub.  :-) )
<br />
<br />The video I plan on making will probably be for River City Ransom -- one of my favourite games of all times -- the cart of which doesn't even work any more (blinking gray screen).  Doesn't matter if I push on it, blow on it, wiggle it, whatever.  Nada.  Looking at the contacts it's obvious they need to be cleaned, so I want to use it as an example.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, magic erasers are great, I've got a big box of them.  I don't use it on anything that can scratch though.  The stuff is like fine sandpaper, using it to remove a mark on a painted wall I expect would discolor the paint.
<br />
<br />I looked up the Weiman glass cook top cleaner MSDS, it seems to be isopropyl alcohol with some acidic stuff (says pH is 4.2 - 5.0).  And apparently the odor is 'Apple', heh.  Definitely should clean all that residue off with pure water and/or alcohol.
<br />
<br />If you use an actual contact cleaner like <a href="http://www.caig.com/" class="postlink">DeoxIt</a> though, the residue left behind is a good thing because it protects it.  I've bought some of that stuff for cleaning old carts as well as conditioning brand new ones.

<br />
<br />This is the type of stuff I've been looking for.  I want something that leaves something behind that prevents corrosion and continues to protect after application.  I thought about leaving a trace amount of contact grease on the carts but I don't think that would be a good idea in the long run.  This stuff looks like a much better solution.
