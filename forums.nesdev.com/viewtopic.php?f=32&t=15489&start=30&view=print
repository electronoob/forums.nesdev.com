Will still get around to that in a few days. (Hoping I can do it before Ludum Dare; I'll be checked out that whole weekend)<br /><br />I just updated the first byte now - that's a good idea I just hadn't gotten to yet. I'm debating whether I want to put the effort into the checksum. It's a good idea, and I wish I'd had that when I first build all the collectible stuff. I'm a little concerned with how many places I might have to update to not break how it works now, so I've been holding off.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I confirmed that the Action 53 version returns to the menu.<br /><br />But I found something confusing.<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>If I take a running leap from here, </li><li>I end up on top of this structure. </li><li>If I press Select here, nothing happens. </li><li>And my way is blocked. </li></ol></div><br /><br />Thanks for testing that, and reporting that bug. Looks like a level design bug - I've just put in a fix to make the ice castle thing a little bigger so you can't get on top of it. (I'd like the engine to be smart enough to not let me do that... but I never was able to come up with a good way to do it.) The castle actually looks a bit better that way anyway.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">JRoatch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">For some reason I never got the level select screen in my play through of this build.</div><br /><br />That's kind of concerning - it shows up once you've beaten all levels, or at least it should. I haven't done a full play-through after the last few builds (naughty me!) and need to get around to that - it's possible I broke it. I'll be sure to check that. <br /><br />-----<br /><br />Aside from that, JRoatch brought up a good point - is what I'm doing with the reset button something sane to do? I don't really want to do it if it's something that bothers people -- especially if I've gotten around the big problem by adding the exit to menu item in levels, and moving to memory addresses that aren't used. I like the idea personally, but I understand the concern.<br /><br />Does anyone else have an opinion?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One more super minor tweak - allow the a button to be used on the menu instead of just start.<br /><br />This is likely the final version for the multicart. I ran through it on the latest multicart (on powerpak, yay) and poked it a bit; everything seems stable. The only thing I might do is take the time to get rid of that pesky graphical glitch at level start. I can't stop seeing it now, but I'm having a seriously hard time finding what I'm doing outside vblank/forced blank. <br /><br />(Note: if that improving existing entries contest ever happens, I may tweak Waddles more for that. As it stands though, I need a long break from that codebase) <br /><br /><br />Hoping we can turn off exit patching for this game in the multicart, though after moving the gem data around it's far less necessary.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for that very thorough feedback. You're correct, you played the version I entered into the contest - some of that was dealt with soon after. The entry into the contest was... pretty bad; it scored poorly and for good reason. I'd like to think the fixes made it more playable, but aren't substantial enough to try again. I'm treating this entry as a learning experience. Onto the feedback...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It was exactly as fast as I could read it…which means it's too fast.</div><br /><br />By far the most common piece of feedback I got. I halved it in the post-compo version and that helped. (Though now the music sounds worse, and I didn't compose a replacement, but... at least the story's readable)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">There's no guard against shifting onto a ghost enemy in the final warp-level, and if you do, you just die without seeing what killed you, making me think a few times that enemy corpses gained &quot;touch=kill&quot; at that level, which they don't.</div> <br /><br />Yeah, I probably made those guys a little too fast. That combined with the blinking didn't go well. I never figured out a great solution to this one; it's in the final build. I do want to make them hard, but of course not unfair.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">There's another place you can get trapped, by jumping to the right over some ice (somewhere in the mid-levels? ) but that one allows you to kill yourself, so I wasn't stuck. Tepples caught this.<br /><br />[and]<br /><br /><br />There's a place where lava tiles are level with the ground surrounding it, and as a result, Waddles gets burned at a different location than &quot;this is the last pixel I could jump from&quot; when it's not lava.</div> <br /><br />Yeah, I had a lot of that type of issue in the original entry. I think I've gotten most of the level bugs taken care of by now. They were pretty bad though - a number of people I showed the entry to fell into that lava one. I fixed those pretty quick, at least.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Stacking the tree graphics is ugly; they're not drawn to be over nonground. Have you got spare CHR? There are even points where it wasn't necessary as the trees are under a solid wall…</div><br /><br />You're actually the first to mention this - I had that thought myself and struggled with it a bit. The problem is, it isn't 1 tile; it's 5 (one per dimension)... and each of those are comprised of 4 chr tiles -- so each switchable tile ends up taking up 20 chr/256. I had a full row of switchables, and I didn't have room for much more. <br /><br />I am using chr ram, so there were some options there, but I also was running very low on prg space in the rom. I compressed graphics where I could, but realistically I couldn't find a way to fit more tiles and the logic to show them into the space I had. Given more time I'm sure I could've gotten there.<br /><br />Also, the trees under a solid wall were generally put there to block the way until you switched dimensions. They had function going for them, but certainly not form...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The 2.5 block standing jump is …I don't think I have succeeded on anything except &quot;stomp snake or turtle&quot; with it. Adding half a block to it and the walking jump might help a lot.</div><br /><br />This is another piece of feedback I got a lot (alongside not having any acceleration in the character's movement) and sadly one I never fixed. The hangup here is that changing that would change how far Waddles can jump - which would require redesigning a lot of levels. I'm mainly thinking of the few fake-out jumps, but this would also likely create new places to get stuck. <br />I just didn't have the time post-contest to redo all of the levels... even though I wanted to. Plus, I just got tired of working in that codebase constantly after 6 months. I dropped most other personal projects too, which was a poor choice.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's a bit more straightforward and less spooky than Eversion; there's no point where there's a forced transition and no point where taking a warp is the wrong move (though it might miss you one or two gems half a screen further).</div><br /><br />That.. sucks. I didn't realize this until after the contest but it's really true. The first few levels had small almost-puzzles, but I never really grew those out - later levels focused entirely on platforming. This also really points to needing to redesign all of the levels. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Mid-level checkpoints might be nice; Eversion had those. It would mean you'd want to add &quot;restart from beginning&quot; as well as the &quot;restart from checkpoint&quot; as separate options in the pause menu, though.</div><br /><br />Funnily enough I never seriously considered this. It was a fleeting thought at one point, but no more. <br /><br /><br />-----<br /><br />All of that feedback is welcome - if nothing else I'll use it to do a better job next time. I don't know if I've actually mentioned it but this was my first full-scale game using assembly. I had a completely separate action/rpg/wishes-it-was-zelda engine going, but I hardly have all the kinks out of that. So... getting anything at all out there was a challenge. I don't think I prioritized the right things, and I'm generally kind of unhappy with the results - but I did get it to a playable state. <br /><br /><br />I understand a lot of what people suggested is simple, and in retrospect it should have been. The problem is I was still a complete noob when I wrote a lot of this code (let's be honest, I still am! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />) and as a result the code is pretty hard to navigate. I also used resources very poorly, so in order to make changes now I have to find prg space often. This leads to doing weird bank switches and jumps to fit it in - completely going against the logic I had to separate things originally. Rewriting the whole thing would be great but there was very little time for that. <br /><br />I might pick this back up for another contest where we revisit past entries - I'd actually like to do that. But for now, I really need a break from this codebase. My NES development isn't stopping though - I've still got plenty to learn and play with! (see: nesnet and Missing Lands)<br /><br />Thanks again for the feedback!

That's Bad. (Can't recall if I got t-fragged by the one after that once I got faster, but he surprised me a little at least once.)<br /><br />Likewise, lavaballs can show up already in mid-air, though I don't recall any telefragging me. I never got telefragged by a shark, either, but I'm sure there's a spot it can happen on that last level. Some placeholder sprite on other levels would alleviate this: a jumping fish for the lavaballs, a swimming one for the shark…not sure what would fit for the ghost; it'd only be useful on level 9.

There are a few walls I blocked with trees later on where you had to jump into them where that wouldn't have worked, however I definitely could have improved the look a bit in most places. Thanks!<br /><br />For the switchback dude, I get you now - yeah, that guy could probably just be removed at this point. There's enough of them elsewhere. Good feedback.<br /><br />Lastly, lava balls -&gt; fish; that's a good idea; I hadn't considered that. I'm not sure what that might mean for ice though. Maybe for ice I wouldn't show them at all (The fish is trapped under the ice, sorry!) - I think that would still help. <br /><br />I think the deadline for the cart has kind of passed, so I'm not going to really rush to do any of this, but thanks for some really good feedback.
