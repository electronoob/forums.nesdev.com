For chip ordering on multi-socket, the only thing you can go off of is what socket the chips are installed in on the PCB -- and it needs to be documented which is 0, which is 1, which is 2, etc...  They are not always in linear order (all depends on PCB; some go in weird orders like 4, 0, 3, 2, 1, etc...).  Sadly I don't have any documentation for these boards so I can't really help.
<br />
<br />Here's a picture explaining how many ROMs there are per board, yadda yadda.  The EPROM sockets have more pins than the SRAM sockets, so that's an easy way to determine which is which.  But as I said, for the ordering, it's anyone's guess without documentation or silkscreening on the board:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.malkavian.com/~jdc/interplay_pcbs.png">http://www.malkavian.com/~jdc/interplay_pcbs.png</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />EDIT: It looks like some of the boards have silkscreened orders on them.  I.e. "U1 EPROM" would be the 1st ROM (assuming first in order), "U2 EPROM" would be the 2nd ROM (assuming 2nd in order), etc..  At least that's my assumption.
<br />
<br />On the boards that only have 2 sockets for ROM (the 3rd socket is for an SRAM chip), that shouldn't be too hard to determine, as the last ROM should have some cartridge information near the end of the ROM.  Addresses $FFB0 through $FFDF should contain the necessary information (see page 1-2-8 of the devkit manual I linked to in an earlier post).

<br />Nobody will know until its dumped.  It might be, then again it might not be.  Who knows what's on the chips until they're dumped?  And who's to say the EPROMs (one or more) haven't gone bad?
<br />
<br />Someone should probably put the PCBs in their SNES first to see if any of the "games" even work -- some might be boards that are missing ROM sets (like that one PCB which only has the BT32V EPROM and nothing else with it; who knows if that's a full game or not?).  If you do this, make sure you put the PCBs in correctly (I imagine its absolutely possible to put them in backwards; don't do that else risk damaging everything!)

<br />Here is a pic where I compare the boogerman eprom rom and one of the BT32V roms

<br />
<br />
<br />At the beginning of the BT32V rom 62295.bin and the rom named blacktape.bing code there you can see:
<br />
<br />
<br />EAMG RV CSG 94??
<br />2 APEPRM-Bakonfrte3x
<br />2 APEPRM-Bakotfrte3x
<br />
<br />I believe Black tape is a PAL and 62295 is a NTSC. I dont see any similarity with the blackthrone working rom.

<br />After looking at the dump a bit I found that bigithinkclay2rom4.bin is a bad dump or the chip was empty when read. blacktape.BIN and BT32V 62295.BIN contain almost 90% the same data. Also, I'm not sure what gave you the idea some eprom were from Clayfighter 2 but I can't find much similarity in data for now. We would really need the rest of the chip in order to do anything. Also, D4S might be able to help a lot providing that he has any interest at all in prototype.
<br />
<br />Personally, I would be disappointed if I was the one having purchase those pcb.

<br />Blacktape, and Bt32V 62295.bin are bothe the same but one is pall and the other Ntsc.
<br />
<br />The owner of the chips (i dunno if I mentioned that Im not the owner)
<br />
<br />told me he made the Clay fighters work, but that he only got a screen up working.
<br />
<br />the rest of the eproms are Lost Vikings 2 and he got it working.
<br />
<br />Im missing one in the math (since I suppose that vikings is 1.0MB and only needs 2 eproms) so there is one missing.
<br />
<br />I will meet him tonight and ask him for everything to try to redump.

<br />Probably because <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=95380#95380" class="postlink">I told him that</a> earlier in this thread.  One of the EPROMs (on a 2-EPROM PCB) has the handwritten text "Clay 2" on it.  Of course what's written on a label doesn't necessarily reflect what's on the EPROM, or if the EPROM is even intact (i.e. might be corrupt or has gotten partially erased), or might have just been a spare EPROM laying around used for who-knows-what.  But at one time, it's safe to say it probably did have some Clayfighter's 2 code on it.

<br />
<br />Ah, I didn't see that part of the post. I stand corrected as I had apparently skipped one of the eprom dump with a clay tag in the file name and big2romclay2.bin does match up with data from Clayfighter 2.  Pichichi010, did you make multiple dump of each chip and compared the data to ensure you had a proper dump? I think it's something important to do to be sure of the dump integrity if you were using a budget programmer like a parallel willem. Also, one other curious thing is those string of text you can find in a few of the dump that Pichichi010 mentioned earlier. A quick google search reveal that the string ''EAMG RV CSG 94'' appear in what seem to be the Sonic Cracker Beta dump but I can't locate the string by myself using a good dump of the game and the one from that web site doesn't seem to load on emulator.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />IMO, it wasn't really smart of you to agree to his request of burning the proto rom since you barely knew the guy. How can someone accidentally erase a prototype eprom in a UV box for like 15 min, I mean, c'mon... And why would he own a UV eraser without owning a eprom programmer? Also, if you try to contact the seller, you get : ''We're sorry we couldn't find an answer for you. Unfortunately, this seller is not able to respond to your question. We suggest reviewing the item again to see if your answer is in the seller's listing.''
<br />
<br />Why don't you try to tell him you had an issue with the programmer and there's good chance part of the dump is corrupted and to bring it back to you to correct it. Then you erase the eprom and your burn a rom that will display a message on screen when he'll try it saying it's bad to rip people off on ebay;) That would be so awesome if you would pull it off. I bet he'll do it again with some of the proto board he found. I saw a dozen of sega genesis prototype pcb on ebay for dirt cheap a few month ago and remember thinking how that it would be used to pull that kind of crap.
<br />
<br />Edit: Since Pichichi010 decided to cover his ass and hide his recent stupid act by editing his post and removing info, here's what happened. That guy who bought the proto on ebay told him he owned a Steven Segal: The Final option SNES prototype but ''accidentally'' erased all 4 (that's right people, 4 chips that accidentally got removed from their respective IC sockets, then accidentally got left in a powered UV eraser for at least 15 to 20 min <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> ) and asked him if he could burn back the prototype rom onto the cart to keep as collector item for himself. Of course, a few days after he agreed the guy listed the prototype as genuine for sale on ebay.

<br />I whish i could program a snes rom saying that lol. I guess i should stop trusting ppl to much. Anyway i reported the auction and post it on nintendoage.com cause there are a lot of proto colectors there that might try to bid. Oh well cant much about it now.
