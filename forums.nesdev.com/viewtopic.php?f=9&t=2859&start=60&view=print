<br />I also alway worry about this. Usually, when soldering the socket, I temporarily put a piece of wire between pins across the chip, so that when I put the socket on the board it stays slightly raised (the plastic does not touch the board), and then no bent pin makes contact with the board. After the socket is soldered, I just pull the piece of wire out.
<br />
<br />However, I don't know it that makes the socket somewhat unstable (since all the force applied when inserting a chip goes directly to the soldered pins). I've been able to insert and remove chips without anything ba hapenning so far...
<br />
<br />Another option would be to cover the contacts with some isolating material, so that there is no problem if the bent pins touch it. Since I can't come up with a good material nor the ideal way to glue it to the board, I never tried this.
<br />
<br />About the holes that are covered with solder, I don't know if there are any guaranties of what they actually are. If I were you, I'd check where they are connect before using them.

<br />Did you understand why I didn't do anything to the CHR chip in my cart? That's because that board uses <strong>CHR-RAM</strong>! Your board uses <strong>CHR-ROM</strong>, if you keep the original chip all the games you put in the PRG chip will use the same graphic tiles of the original game! Of course you don't want that!
<br />
<br />Please, hayabusafmw, I've talked to you about CHR-ROM and RAM so many times already, but it seems you don't listen. Please, pay attention. 
<br />
<br /><strong>CHR-RAM</strong> boards: don't touch the CHR chip;
<br />
<br /><strong>CHR-ROM</strong> boards: if you want the graphics to look correct, you have remove this and install a socket correctly rewired for the chip you're gonna use;

<br />Yes. I can tell you in advance that both A17 and A18 should be connected to GND, since as I said above the MMC1 only handles 128KB of CHR.

<br />What to do about each pin:
<br />
<br />01 - bend up and solder to GND (pin 16)
<br />02 - bend up and solder to hole 24 (A16)
<br />22 - bend up and solder to hole 31 (/CE)
<br />24 - bend up and solder to hole 02 (/OE)
<br />30 - bend up and solder to GND (pin 16)
<br />31 - bend up and connect to +5V (maybe you can even connect it to pin 32, right above this one, without even using wires, just solder)
<br />
<br />Note that I wrote this somewhat quickly, and I can't be sure if everything is correct. You should try to compare the pinouts yourself and see if you end up with the same results I did.

<br />
<br />&amp; it didn't work....
<br />
<br />1 thing i beleive is that the 2nd wire on the prg (left side) is connecting to the Blank hole of a already bent pin on the 3rd wire (right side )....
<br />
<br />&amp; i beleive it made contact up to the bent pin i will unsolder &amp; resolder....
<br />
<br />but i might done it wrong maybe i am at the wrong place.

<br />DON'T DO THIS! You just rewired it so that you could use a DIFFERENT chip! Since you modified the pin assignments, of course the old chip will not work anymore! This kind of test is only valid for NROM, when you don't relocate pins!
<br />
<br />To try this you NEED to burn a MMC1 game on a <strong>AT29C040</strong>, which is the chip you rewired the cart for!

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">hayabusafmw wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I finished Wiring CHR too</div><br />Hope that works fine. I'd worry less about the CHR chip though, because most of the games will still run if it's wired incorrectly (but with scrambled graphics), but you can try to fix that.

<br />Well it is possible, but it's not just a rewiring job. You'd have to get a 74HC161 chip (from some other cart or maybe even "lying around" <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />) <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/nes_discrete/NES_CNROM.html" class="postlink">Here's how CNROM boards work</a>. I think it wouldn't be hard to incorporate the 161 to a NROM board (although it would be hanging), but I hardly think it's worth the trouble. First because I don't remember any good CNROM games, and second, I wouldn't render a nice UNROM (for example) board useless by removing its 74HC161. I'd rather make a UNROM devcart instead.

<br />Since the pinout is the same, I wonder if it would work to try programming it as a 29C010... But I wouldn't try that, because although the pinouts are the same, the operations performed when writing data might not be. And I'm sure you don't want to fry the chips, or, much worse, the programmer.
<br />
<br />Try to search the web for this chip and your EPROM programmer. Someone might have said something abou that.
