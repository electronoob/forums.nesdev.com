Your feedback is much appreciated! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Great Hierophant wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Is there any possibility to add support for Boot ROM 1.01?

Sorry for that! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />The good news is that I can easily recompile another v2.00 update version for you and all v1.01 users, you'd just have to wait a bit as I'm busy with regular work right now. Or, if you know how to use a hex editor, you can add compatibility with your version yourself (it's a one-byte change). <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />To do that, open <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">SI.MAP</tt> (not SU.MAP!) from my v2.00 release with the hex editor of your choice, navigate to offset <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">0x873</tt> and verify that the byte value is $33. Then, change it to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">$31</tt>. Save and close the file, and then try updating again. What this change does is basically change an instruction like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">if ver string starts with v1.02 or v1.03, then ...</tt> to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">if ver string starts with v1.02 or v1.01, then ...</tt> So, nothing special, really (assuming that the version string remained at the exact same offset in the later ROMs, which is likely).<br /><br />BTW, no need to do anything like that again when subsequently updating from v2.00 to v2.01 -- this should work out of the box.<br /><br />Good luck, and let me know if it worked as I expect it will! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First post, new member here. I've been having problems with my Powerpak since I got it this morning. I've formatted my Kingston 4GB countless times and still, nothing. <br /><br />Symptoms are as follows: I'll format the card to FAT32 and first put it in the Powerpak to see whether or not it senses the CF card. It does, then tells me I need to put the Powerpak file on the card. I put it on correctly and start up my NTSC SNES and the start up screen will flicker and the load screen will not work at all. It'll happen for a few seconds and then it will just turn black. <br /><br />Enter CF card #2. A Sandisk 1GB that while slow, seems to work--at least it lets me navigate menus and store some games on it. I open a rom file and then the screen will change to a &quot;Copying Game...&quot; text, which fades in and out--indefinitely. The screen continues way past two minutes and nothing happens. I've tried changing the DMA to 0 and still, nothing. <br /><br />CF #3, just a modern 8GB Sandisk Ultra. I get the sectors left error, which I pretty much expected. Seriously, what is going on here?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been thinking about hiding the POWERPAK folder in the filebrowser entirely. Having to look at that folder has been annoying since the very beginning, anyway. I already came up with a fast and reliable implementation that works great. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />This change, however, would involve altering the way SRAM saving is handled because you'd no longer be able to access the SAVES subfolder. Personally, I like the idea of storing the SRM file along with the ROM file -- just as you might be used to in case you're organizing your ROMs in game folders, like myself. At a later stage (i.e., once I fully understand how FAT32 works), I might even implement an option to create new savefiles residing in the current ROM folder. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So, PowerPak users, please let me know what you think about that. Do you cling to a SAVES subfolder? Or are you fed up with copying your emulator saves to a different location than your ROMs, and like the idea to be able to copy two files (ROM &amp; SRAM) to one and the same folder in the future?<br /><br />I'm looking forward to your feedback! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Maybe you could just implement a &quot;Starting Directory&quot; option that would open the file browser in the folder of my choice. I would set mine to ROMS so I wouldn't see the POWERPAK directory anyways. Just a thought.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But hiding it isn't that much better. I mean I guess the goal is to hide the Powerpak folder and keep the save and roms in their folders together which isn't a bad idea really. I'm just not bothered enough by seeing the PP folder to want it hidden. If you hide it and have saves moved to where the roms are then you need to make sure the auto-save locating still works right?
