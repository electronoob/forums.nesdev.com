		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but I think the rules are a bit weird. I've programmed C for years, and I am STILL a bit confused. Many books and references are a bit too quick / not enough detailed to my taste to approach such a confusing problem.<br /><br />So I'll write my understanding of it here with my words, and someone please tell me if my understanding is wrong.<br /><br />It's a well known fact that the use of an array variable in an expression always yield a pointer to the array itself. This is not hard to understand.<br />What is however complicated is to know when you declare an array and when you declare a pointer.<br />As far as I understand you can declare an array using a pointer notation, and you can <strong>also</strong> declare a pointer using array notation.<br /><br /><strong>RULES FOR UNINITIALIZED POINTERS AND ARRAY VARIABLES</strong><br /><br />Declaration is what decides if the variable is a pointer or an array (obviously). You cannot declare array without knowing their size :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;int a&#91;&#93;;&nbsp; // INVALID<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;int *b;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;int c&#91;12&#93;;<br /></div><br /><br />Size of c is 12 times sizeof int (it consist of 12 consecutive ints in memory), but size of b is just the size of a pointer (consist of a single word in memory).<br /><br />On a side note, an array of 1 is NOT like a pointer, but more like an element itself.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;int d&#91;1&#93;;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;int e;<br /></div><br />Here, both declarations are equivalent (they will reserve the space of an int), the only difference is that when you use d in an expression you get an address, while you get directly the variable if you use e.<br /><br /><strong>RULES FOR INITIALIZED ARRAY AND POINTER VARIABLES</strong><br /><br />If the '=' sign is used at the same time as a variable is declared, this variable is initialised.<br />Just as the case of uninitialized variables, the notation will differentiate pointers and arrays.<br /><br />However there is an exeption for char*, which can be initialized with an address of a string explicitly, as in :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">char *c = &quot;hello&quot;;<br />char d&#91;&#93; = &quot;hello&quot;;<br /></div><br />This will actually declare an array of chars somewhere in the code section with the data &quot;hello\NULL&quot;, and make c point to it as it's declared. d, however, is a full known array that will be created at runtime. For this reason, c is faster and more efficient than d.<br />The worst is that for the user, it makes absolutely no difference, while what is done internally is very different.<br />Sizeof c is a single pointer, while sizeof d is 6 (the # of letters + 1 NULL)<br /><br />Such a notation is impossible for non-string arrays.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int *a = {1, 2, 3};<br /></div><br />Will unfortunately not work.<br /><br />The size inside the array is only here for checking : if you try to initialize an array with a wrong size, the compiler will issue a warning.<br />All three declarations below are absolutely equivalent, and will all declare an array of size 3 elements :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int a&#91;3&#93; = {1, 2, 3};<br />int b&#91;&#93; = {1, 2, 3};<br /></div><br /><br /><strong>RULES FOR ARRAY AND POINTERS WITHIN STRUCTS AND UNIONS</strong><br /><br />Within structures and unions, the same rules for uninitialized variables applies - i.e. arrays needs to have explicit size or else there's a problem.<br /><br /><strong>RULES FOR ARRAY AND POINTER PASSED TO A FUNCTION</strong><br /><br />So far the rules were consitant, but now there is a total shift. No matter which of the 3 notations is used (sized array, non-sized array or pointer), it's always a pointer which is passed to the function.<br /><br />Even if the array has a size indicated, <em>it's just for documenting</em>, and it's completely ignored by the compiler, <s>except for the SIZEOF operator</s>. Unlike with the initialize operator, there is no enforcing that the size is correct, ever.<br /><br />When it comes to return types, array notation for pointers is not allowed. Only pointer notation is possible. The same goes for typedefs, you can't define array types.<br /><br />The following function takes 3 pointers to int (we don't even know if they points to a single element, to an array, or if they point to invalid data), and return a pointer to int (again we can make no assumption on what it point to) :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int *f(int *a, int b&#91;&#93;, int c&#91;3&#93;);<br /></div><br /><br />There is no difference internally on how the a, b and c arguments works, it's only different syntax. The only way to pass an array &quot;by value&quot;, or to return an array by value, is to pack it within a struct or an union. In this case, the entire content of the array will effectively be copied to/from the function. Not that it's a good idea to do this anyway.<br /><br /><strong>RULES WITHIN EXPRESSIONS</strong><br /><br />Because arrays and pointers are used the same way in an expression, something like<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; a&#91;i&#93;;<br /></div><br />&quot;a&quot; could be a pointer to an array or an array directly, you don't know (without looking at the declaration of a), and it's the compiler who does the difference.<br />In all case a[i] will be either the ith element of the a array, or the ith element after the location pointer by a.<br /><br />Now that's all rules for single dimensional arrays, as I understand them.<br />Now let's review quickly how this extends to multiple dimentions :<br /><br /><strong>RULES FOR DECLARING TWO LEVEL OF INDIRECTION</strong><br /><br />Declaration of multiple levels of arrays/pointers is simple enough.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;int **a;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Pointer to pointer<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;int *b&#91;3&#93;;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Array of pointers<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;int (*c)&#91;10&#93;;&nbsp; // Pointer to array (of known size)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;int d&#91;10&#93;&#91;3&#93;;&nbsp; // Array of array<br /></div><br />This is simple enough, but what is confusing is that all them can be deferenced once, or twice, and this will yield different code. Again only the compiler can make a difference.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">a&#91;2&#93;&nbsp; // This is a pointer to int got by dereferencing a (2 elements after the one pointer by a)<br />b&#91;2&#93;&nbsp; // This is a pointer to int within b<br />c&#91;2&#93;&nbsp; // This is a pointer to int got by dereferencing c, but in this case 20 elements after the one pointer by c<br />d&#91;2&#93; // This is an array of int, again it's address starts 20 elements after the one pointed by d<br /></div><br /><br />If the variable is dereferenced two times, for the second levels the rules are the same as for a normal pointer/array.<br /><br /><strong>RULES WHEN PASSING TWO LEVEL OF INDIRECTION TO FUNCTION</strong><br /><br />Again, it doesn't matter which of the four notation above is used, a pointer is passed to the function.<br />I told before the only change was for SIZEOF. Well this time, there IS a major difference in how the pointer is dereferenced, SIZEOF is used internally when dereferencing (as shown in the above examples).<br /><br />As we can say a[2] and b[2] will yield 2 elements after the base adress, while c[2] and d[2] will yield in this case 20 elements after it.<br />The notation used for a and b can be used interchangibly when passing pointers to pointers, or pointers to or array of pointers, and notations c and d when passing pointers to arrays directly (of known size).<br /><br />In this example :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void f(int&#91;3&#93;&#91;&#93; a, (*int)&#91;3&#93; b, int&#91;3&#93;&#91;10&#93; c);<br /></div><br /><br />a, b, and c works exactly the same, exept that sizeof(c) is 30 integer elements while sizeof b is of 3 pointers elements, and sizeof a is unknown.<br /><br />All sizes exept the last must be specified, so that when you apply a dereference, the sizeof is known.<br /><br />In this case it might also be preferable to only explicit a single level of indirection, and make the second level with math explicitly in the code, so that it shows you know what you're doing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't like how often you assert that pointers are the same. For example: &quot;the use of an array variable in an expression always yield a pointer to the array itself&quot; is only true when that term of the expression is a pointer type. If the expression resolves to an array type, it's still an array.<br /><br />Arrays can be cast to pointers implicitly, but the array carries an advantage that as an array type it retains its size information as part of the type. This can be very useful for compile-time checking, and it is often worth using array types instead of pointers for this reason.<br /><br />You cannot pass an array by value, however. As a parameter to a function it is automatically treated as a reference. This is still not exactly &quot;the same&quot; as a pointer, because of the retained type information, but it is similar to a pointer in that it is a reference and no copy of the array is made by passing it to a function. You can, however, place an array inside a struct to pass it by value.<br /><br />Another distinction that is important is what happens to an array when the variable falls out of scope vs. what happens to a pointer. If you created the array inside a function, for example, it gets cleaned up when the function exits. Data pointed to does not get deleted automatically.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The standard uses the word &quot;decay&quot; to describe the implicit array-to-pointer conversion, as well as the function-to-pointer conversion. If you try to &quot;pass by value&quot; an array (use the array's name directly), the decay operation &quot;convert&quot; the array to a pointer to its first element. For a function, the only operation is to take its address.<br /><br />Note that the decay conversion only remove the first &quot;rank&quot;, e.g.:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int a&#91;4&#93;&nbsp; &nbsp; ==&gt; (int *)</div><br />whereas<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int a&#91;4&#93;&#91;8&#93; ==&gt; (int (*)&#91;8&#93;)</div><br /><br />Note that if you get a pointer to an array, you keep all the information about the array. With C++ this also happens with references.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int a&#91;4&#93;;<br />&amp;a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ==&gt; (int (*)&#91;4&#93;)</div><br /><br />This is a trick in C++ to get arrays of T with its bounds:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">template &lt;typename T, size_t N&gt;<br />&nbsp;void get_array(T (&amp;arr)&#91;N&#93;)<br />{<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />}</div><br />Of course, this requires a template instanciation for every T and N; if your function is complex and you use alot of arrays with differents bounds, then this will generate code for all the different kind of arrays, so watch out.<br /><br />Functions are a strange beast in C and C++: you can dereference them infinitely and it will still be a pointer to function.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int fn(void);<br />******fn&nbsp; &nbsp; ==&gt; (int (*)(void))</div>

It was a typeless language; implicitly, all variables are int, and arrays where just a pointer to an array, and anyway you could dereference an int just like a pointer. Assigning to an &quot;array&quot; just change the variable holding the array address.<br /><br />Excerpt:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">auto X&#91;4&#93; = {1,2,3,4};<br />auto Y&#91;4&#93; = {5,6,7,8};<br /><br />auto a = X;<br />X = Y;<br />Y = a;<br />*a =+ 1;<br />/* a points to Y, X = {5,6,7,8}, Y = {2,2,3,4} */<br /></div><br />(The compound assignment operator were reversed at this time)<br /><br />So, basically, in B it is as if an array was just a pointer to its first element. When C was designed and standardised, the &quot;array-is-an-pointer&quot; thing has to be kept, in order to have working B programs in C.<br /><br />(From <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html" class="postlink">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html</a>)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Disclaimer: C99 added some things that arrays could do that probably adjust some of this slightly, particularly function arguments, e.g. void f( int a [n], int n ) or something like this can automatically pass the size, and array literals can be created mid-expression similar to string literals.<br /><br />An array is an object type like any other:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int a &#91;10&#93; // array of 10 int objects<br /></div><br />Similar to a floating-point value, using it where a pointer is needed it decays into one:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int* p = a; // p = &amp;a &#91;0&#93;<br />int* p2 = a + 1; // p = &amp;a &#91;1&#93;<br />int i = 1.0; // i = (int) 1.0<br /></div><br />Of course saying that a+1 is equivalent to &amp;a[1] is technically circular, since a[n] is defined as *((a)+(n)).<br /><br />It doesn't always decay into a pointer:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">typedef int a_t &#91;10&#93;;<br />a_t* ap = &amp;a;<br />int (*ap2) &#91;10&#93; = &amp;a; // equivalent without using a typedef<br />size_t s = sizeof a;<br /></div><br />The first yields a pointer to the array object itself, not any of the ints. The second gives the size of the array, 10*sizeof(int).<br /><br />Functions don't take arrays; trying to declare one merely declares a pointer to an element:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">void f1( int a &#91;10&#93; );&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // void f1( int* a )<br />void f2( int a &#91;&#93; );&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // void f2( int* a )<br />void f3( int a &#91;10&#93; &#91;20&#93; ); // void f3( int (*a) &#91;20&#93; );<br /></div><br />f3() shows how it's merely a pointer to an element of the top-level array, because each element of it is an array of 20 ints. You'd call these functions with arguments just as you'd initialize said types normally.<br /><br />Multi-dimensional arrays are simply arrays of arrays, so when you're dealing with one you're only dealing with the outer-most array. Once you dereference that to one of the element arrays, then you're dealing with the next inner one. The handling is consistent.<br /><br />As for initialization, you can leave off the size and let the compiler set it based on the number of initializers:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int a &#91;&#93; = { 1, 2, 3 }; // int &#91;3&#93;<br /></div><br />Strings are special. A string literal used as an array initializer is expanded internally:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">char s &#91;&#93; = &quot;Hello&quot;; // = { 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 0 }<br /></div><br />When used where a pointer is needed, the compiler further internally declares and initializes an array object and then uses that:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">char* p = &quot;Hello&quot;<br /></div><br />is equivalent to<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">char __str &#91;&#93; = &quot;Hello&quot;;<br />char* p = __str;<br /></div>

Like any other object, it names the object, the array. You can take its address, which is a pointer to the array. You can get its size, which is the size of the array.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In fact, a scalar variable can be subscripted with the array bracket like thus:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int var = 0, vee = 5;<br />printf(&quot;vee:&nbsp; %d\n&quot;,(&amp;var)&#91;1&#93;);<br /></div></div><br />That's undefined behavior. (&amp;var)[0] is OK though. As would be<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int a &#91;2&#93;;<br />int* p = &amp;a &#91;1&#93;;<br />printf( &quot;a&#91;0&#93;: %d\n&quot;, p&#91;-1&#93;);<br /></div><br />Subscripting actually isn't directly tied to arrays. E1 [E2] is literally defined to be equivalent to (*((E1)+(E2))). So you're just doing *(&amp;var+0), or just *&amp;var. Combined with arrays decaying into a pointer to the first element, indexing works on an array.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't know about the typeless B language, that's a fun think to know (not that I would progamm using this though).<br /><br />blargg, what you say is basically compatible with what I said, which is good news.<br />However you were able to typedef an array. I wasn't able because I was placing the brackets at the wrong place, so it's my bad for saying you can't typedef arrays.<br /><br />So I think most of the confusion is cleared up a bit. In my opinion the concepters of the C language did 2 major errors :<br />1) Allow arguments of function to be arrays. They should either forbid it (like they do for return types), or make it pass arrays by value (with the mention VERY BAD IDEA added to it), but at least it would be consistent with the language scementics.<br />2) Don't differenciate the &quot;pointer to int&quot; type and &quot;pointer to int array&quot; type. In the vast majority of cases pointers point to arrays. Adding to the fact that pointer and array notation is interchangeable to a certain extent, and that they also did error 1, it really creates a confusing mess.<br /><br />So in the end your pointer to an array has to be declared as a pointer, and your pointer to a bidirectional array has to be declared with this funky &quot;pointer to array&quot; type with parenthesis. How lame.<br /><br />The more I do computer science the more I feel like assembly is at the same time the absolute worst language when it comes for maintainability and productivity, but the only one who isn't completely f**** up in its scementics.
