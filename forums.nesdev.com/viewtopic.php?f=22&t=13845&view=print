		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I suppose I should introduce myself first, I am Tony from Electric Adventures, a software company I started back in the early 80's when I published titles for the original Spectravideo and MSX home computers.  I also wrote articles and software for several magazines, as well as publishing the Australian MSX community news letter Micro's Gazette in the later part of the 80's.<br />After awakening from hibernation (well years of writing business software anyway) about five years ago and wanting to relive/revisit the 80's I resurrected most of my source code and started by making new tool sets for cross development for the original Spectravideo, MSX and Colecovision.  <br />Three of my original games from the 80's were released by Collectorvision as EA Classics, which immediately sold out.<br />And last year I was asked by Collectorvision if I could make a special game for the NES i.e. the Game On Expo Championships cartridge, which contained three games, two based on Collectorvision's properties Sydney Hunter and Pedal To The Metal and a 3rd game being a conversion of one of my original games from the 80's - Meteor Swarm.<br />It was a fun experience and exciting challenge to not only learn 6502 but the NES architecture.<br />Part of my learning process involved building a tile set tool (that I may release later as I have done my editor for MSX/Coleco).<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br />Now that I am more used to the NES architecture I plan to slowly release more games based on/inspired by my games I released for the MSX and the first one that I have just sent off for Beta testing is called Meteor Swarm.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br />So yes, it is (very) heavily inspired by Asteroids, but to my knowledge no game like that was ever released for the NES or Famicom.<br />The game is functionality complete, bar a couple of issues that I know about and of course any found by my beta testers.<br />So I hope to be able to announce the game ready to be ordered in the coming weeks.  <br />The box art is currently being put together, so I will share that when it is ready.<br />The game will be produced by Collectorvision and come in a new plastic shell, along with a manual and cardboard box.

This should hopefully address the underlying flaw in Asteroids game play of leaving a single meteor and just shooting UFO's until you get sick of it.<br />I also agree the speed goes a bit haywire on level 5, might be an issue with my maths, I'll have a look at it, thanks.
