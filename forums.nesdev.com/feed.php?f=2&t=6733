If it's reasonable to expect the job to be done with &lt;= 1 day's work (8 hours) then I think $100 would be entirely fair.<br />I'm sure there are some people here who can write what you had in mind. It's just a matter of getting them interested (and money may not be the driving factor there). Good luck with the hunt anyway.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Thu Aug 05, 2010 8:11 am</p><hr />

Just to make it clear, I never doubted you were serious about this.<br /><br />I just wrote to be sure there wasn't a way for you to give a spoiler-free description of the project.<br /><br />You know, if someone was paying $2000 for a programming job, everyone would be jumping on it without even caring what the job actually is, but since the pay is not that high (and I'm not saying it's low either, it might be perfectly acceptable depending on the type of work that needs to be done), an idea of what the project is about could get people more interested.<br /><br />Well, I guess I'm sending a PM because I'm a very curious guy! =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Aug 04, 2010 9:37 pm</p><hr />

The people who came here asking for a programmer like you mention all had 1 post.  I know I don't post a lot and have only been registered for a few years, but it's more then 1 post. Second, I posted last year looking to hire someone for a job.  I hired a person for that job and then hired them for a second job.  I can't offer you pay slips as proof, but someone has been successfully hired here for a job.<br /><br /><br />I offered money to make it look more serious as I expect the person to take the job a bit more serious, ie sorting out and discussing details, keeping me up to date, follow some sort of timeline, etc.  I'm not saying 9-5, but just communication and common courtesy like I can't start for a month, asking if I want it like this or like that, etc like you would for a paid position.<br /><br />I didn't think the secret thing would be as big of deal because I noticed some people here doing that as part of their own projects, but it must of hit a nerve as more then a few have mentioned it.  You can PM me to discuss more, but here are a few details as suggested to me via PM.  I am looking to hire someone to modify an existing game.  Familiarity with debugging tools is most likely required.  I don't have all the details of what needs to be done or I would of done it myself, but here is what I think needs to be done.  The gameplay routine should probably be unaffected and just some modification of startup routines and memory checks.  I don't think it is a particularly large job.<br /><br />I'm open to discuss any details via PM so feel free to PM me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3385">2600</a> — Wed Aug 04, 2010 3:43 pm</p><hr />

Sorry, I didn't realize $100 was so low.  I based that purely on the fee I paid for the last job I hired for, where the person here set the fee, and just doubled what I believe I ended up paying.  I'm flexible on the fee as I don't know how long the actual project would take.  If it takes an hour, $100 seems pretty good, but if it takes the person a long time I feel they should be compensated for that as well.<br /><br />I have no problem discussing 100% of the details over PM with anyone, but would like to keep it to PM and would appreciate it if everyone I talk to does the same.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3385">2600</a> — Wed Aug 04, 2010 12:09 pm</p><hr />

I didn't show any interest because of how little info was given. Since $100 is a pretty low fee for a programming job, I know I'd be more interested if you revealed something about the project itself rather than how much you are willing to pay.<br /><br />I guess that what I mean is that the nature of the project might be more interesting than the money. Does it really have to be 100% secret?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Aug 04, 2010 11:46 am</p><hr />

I've had little interest in this here and am open to suggestions if I should look elsewhere.  I don't believe the job is particularly easy and that's why I wanted to try here as I find the people here more familiar with the system.

It seems I've found myself in need of hiring someone from here again.  I hired someone from nesdev last year and had a few successful jobs with them.  Now I have another task that I'd like done.  Last job was per hour, but I was thinking of just doing a flat fee on this one.  If you are interested, please PM me for details as I would like all details kept private atm.<br /><br />Also, If I posted in the wrong forum or these posts are not allowed here please let me know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3385">2600</a> — Mon Aug 02, 2010 1:16 pm</p><hr />
