Just as 0x80 is -128 when viewed as a signed byte (0x81 is -127, 0xFE is -2, 0xFF is -1, and so on).

Even the official manual says 16-bits, but we all know it's probably crap. <br /><br />I'm so confused. My experience thus far is from converting a 16-bit PCM samples to BRR format successfully with no filter, (filter 0). That worked without any 15-bit treatment. How does that change with filters, and why did I not need to do these weird bounds checking in my filter 0 encoder?

So the largest positive value you'd been able to produce with filter 0 is <strong>(7 SHL 12) SAR 1</strong> = 0x3800, which is in the safe range. <br /><br />For negative values the max would be <strong>(-8 SHL 12) SAR 1</strong> = 0xC000 = -0x4000 (16-bit), which when clipped to 15-bit should still be -0x4000. This would not be safe to use according to the fullsnes document, since it falls below -0x3FFA.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But would the best approach be to simply downgrade the step to -7? Surely that's better than tossing the value the completely, I mean you need to use something right?<br /><br /><br />Lots of questions entailing... Such as what to do if the higher value is a good match for the sample's original value, but not in accordance with FullSnes' specifications. Do you just take step one lower than that?<br /><br /><br /><br />I guess there's room for experimentation.<br /><br />Plus I am a little ahead of myself, outside the scope of filter=0 anyways. Because I am sure I can make better decisions once I finally tackle actually filtering a sample.

You'd have to ask nocash how he arrived at his conclusions since it's his document.<br /><br />But if we accept what the document says as true, then the 16-bit samples are converted to 15-bit by means of throwing away the msb before they are sent to the DSP's filter. What happens when you throw away the msb of -32768? You get 0; probably not the desired result. What happens if you first shift it right one bit and then throw away the msb? You get -16384; the maximum negative value that you can represent with 15 bits, and probably the result you wanted.

Sony <em>tried</em> to handle overflows automatically. But they've accidently saturated the values to 16bits (-8000h..+7FFFh) and did then cripple it to 15bits by removing the sign bit. What they wanted to do was saturating to 15bits (-4000h..+3FFFh). And even if they would have got that part right, values exceeding -3FFAh..+3FF8h would be still causing problems in the buggy gauss interpolation unit.<br /><br />In result, you'll need to take care of that yourself: Be sure that the filtered values don't sum up to something that exceeds the -3FFAh..+3FF8h range.<br /><br />But before blaming Sony too much: One should normally take care that the values don't exceed the the supported range anyways (ie. they have only failed to do some automatic error-handling... which would be needed only if the BRR samples contain crappy data).<br /><br />If you use looped sounds combined with the (lossy) compression filters: Then incoming old/older values may grow bigger and bigger in each loop-cycle (causing overflows after repeating the loop too many times). The safest way to avoid that would be to put at least one BRR block with filter=0 into the loop (that forces the following old/older values back to clearly defined settings).
