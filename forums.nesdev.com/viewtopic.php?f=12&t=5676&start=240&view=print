		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The MISO, MOSI, SCK, and CLK pins are all used for CIC communications so those are routed to the NES/SNES cart connector for you already.  The only one that needs to be added is /RESET in order to ISP the chips.  But then again I use a avrdoper programmer that provides a CLK signal for ISP.  I don't think all programmers provide that so you'd want to make sure you're covered there with your programmer (CLK not SCK)<br /><br />For NES I route the reset pin to the expansion port (EXP5) so the CIC can easily be programmed in circuit via the 72pin connector.  SNES I didn't have a good pin available so I have an extra 10pin connector on the side which is where I routed /RESET it's also used for JTAG programming on the CPLD.<br /><br />Using a socket works too though.  I used a different solution for awhile when I didn't have the reset pin routed to a connector.  I'd leave the reset pin lifted when soldering, then I could use a mini grabber clip to get the /RESET pin for ISP, and solder it down to the PCB after programming.

I've always preferred working with AVR chips over PIC (not that there's anything wrong with them), so it's nice to see someone with a mod that's not PIC-based!  Thanks!!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Am I right in thinking that the ATtiny13 version won't work in lock mode?  I'm looking for a chip to go in a console, so I guess I'll have to wait for the lock version to be released.  Any idea when that will be?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone<br /><br />I'm writing this message to get a little help with Super CIC mods on SNES'.<br />I already performed two SuperCic mods : one on my Super Nes (PAL) and the other on my Super Famicom.<br />I programmed my PICs (16F630) with a small K150 Automatic Programming USB device and the lock.hex file provided at WolfSoft.de. I scrupulously followed the wiring method on this website.<br />On both cases, I used duo-leds (red-green-orange) and on both cases, I have 2 problems :<br /><br />First, the region auto-detection doesn't seem to be working. When the led turns orange, PAL games always run at 60Hz.<br />Could someone tell me which of the PIC pin is responsible for the auto-detection mode so I can check what I did wrong ?<br /><br />And second, all of my 40 games work just fine on both consoles, except for Super Mario RPG. (though it works on my unmodded Super Famicom)<br /><br />Anyone had the same problems ?
