I don't mind fake boxes that look awesome (I got a few shockboxes too, but only because I got them with the carts, I have no idea where you get new ones), but putting fake logos and stuff on it is really dumb.<br /><br />And it's not really a grey area. Putting Nintendos logo on something they didn't endorse isn't just against their policy, it's illegal. Not that I care, but it's pretty black on white <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I put Neo-Geo logos on those fake boxes, and I don't really care if people on the internet disagree with that. In that sense I can fully understand why someone would like a similar box for a Nintendo game that never had one. I of course do not agree with anyone selling a fake copy of something and try to pass it off as the real deal to try and trick someone. But this isn't that.

But there are enough idiots on the internet who get their hands on these reproductions and who sell it as some rare prototype or small batch release of a legitimate game. (The same idiots who list a cart-only &quot;Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt&quot; as &quot;ultra rare&quot;.)<br /><br />And clueless people might fall for it, just because NintendoAge wasn't honest and didn't put their logo on it, but created a counterfeit game with a fake Seal of Quality, fake company logos, fake copyright notes and a fake barcode.

The Nintendo Seal etc. are a fun and welcome detail for many people.<br /><br />I don't think most of the people here would want a fraudulent seal on their game boxes, but it's just a familiar and nostalgic symbol for tons of people. Not everybody cares about what it was supposed to mean, they just like the look of it.<br /><br />The idea that it's illegal is completely unimportant. Everything about it is already illegal.

I see why it's fun to make your own reproductions and fancy boxes etc. Hell, I made a port of Donkey Kong myself, which isn't exactly my copyright, but it was super interesting for me to do.<br />But taking stuff other people made, and reproducing it on your own to sell it for profit ? That's a special kind of terrible morals.

But NROM-era Nintendo games had the &quot;black box&quot; look, and Konami's early output had its own distinctive border. Only starting around 1990 (e.g. <em>Dr. Mario</em>) did Nintendo start to standardize the borders of licensed games, adding the red bar across the top.

But I didn't actually put a &quot;Copyright 1985&quot; into the game. And after telling the fake backstory in the manual, I continued with: &quot;At least this is what it might have looked like if we had actually been game developers 30 years ago&quot; and then I write how the game really came to be.<br /><br />And when I ordered a reproduction of &quot;Tower of Radia&quot;, I created a label with the official artwork and company logo (the game's ROM is a 1:1 copy after all, so the code is still by Tecmo and the artwork belongs to the game that you play on screen, so you can just as well put this on the label), but with a clear text: &quot;Reproduction&quot; and the website from where I got this reproduction.<br /><br />When I got to the conclusion that the game's fighting mechanics are too boring for me and I gave the game away, I can be sure that there's no way this ends up at eBay with the statement: &quot;Never released prototype cartridge from 1992. Ultra rare and highly valuable. $200.&quot;<br />If it gets on eBay, everybody sees the URL and can easily find out that it was home-made and can be ordered for $10 and a donor cart.<br /><br />(Ironically, the guy who makes the reproductions does the same dick move of putting the Nintendo Seal of Quality on his works. I got a different label because I explicitly said that I <em>don't</em> want this and sent him my own label.)<br /><br />So, unless you want to make a movie and use this as a prop, there's absolutely no reason to apply make-believe and &quot;what if&quot; to the real world. An NES collection is not a work of fiction. It's part of the real world. &quot;I'm an NES collector and these are my games.&quot; That's real. That's not part of an act. So, there's no point in <em>pretending</em>: &quot;And this is my copy of &quot;F-1 Race&quot; which was part of the initial run of NES games in 1985.&quot;
