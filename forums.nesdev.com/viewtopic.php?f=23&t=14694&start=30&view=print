		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Neo Geo's picture is theoretically 320 pixels wide, but I'll say 304 because the left and right 8 pixels are often blanked in the fix layer so as not to intrude on the horizontal blanking period. (Neo Geo pixels are wider than Genesis pixels, and only 312 of the 320 fit in the regulation scanline, compared to 350 for the Genesis.) Each scanline can have 96 slivers, each 16 pixels wide. Making a background out of linked sprites would eat up (304/16)+1 = 20 slivers, and that's only if the layer has full coverage (such as a semitransparent waterfall). A layer with lots of blank space in it, such as the layer that the player is on, would presumably have fewer background slivers. So even if you're using sprites to build three layers of backgrounds, comparable to the Super NES or CPS, you still have about 200% of overdraw left, compared to about 100% for the contemporary consoles (Genesis and Super NES).<br /><br />The Super NES has a silicon bug where (if I recall correctly) only the 34 rearmost 8x1 pixel slivers would be drawn, not the frontmost. Does the Neo Geo have a similar bug?

A standard NTSC TV scanline is 52.1 microseconds long porch to porch, but 320 pixels at a 6 MHz dot clock are 53.3 microseconds. Cropping it with the fix layer reduces the picture to 50.7 microseconds, which doesn't come as close to the color burst on the left or the sync pulse on the right. For a very rough Nintendo counterpart, see the discussions about TVs that respond poorly to color $0D.

No game is going to use all 384 sprites and things about bandwidth. The sprite thing is easy, lots of games don't use their platform's maximum amount of ANYTHING. This thing about overdraw and who has more, again I've played lots of NeoGeo games and this doesn't seem to be an issue in those. Your comments about bandwidth I don't get. I can understand wanting to critique the hardware but I don't see your point. <br /><br />The hardware I used to complain about was the Sega Genesis and it's lack of colors available at once. I always thought it would have been a relatively simple to implement more and made a huge difference. Something as straight forward as separate palette sets for background tiles and sprite tiles. I know the issue was probably related to die space on the VDP but I really think the cost would have been worth it. <br /><br />I don't see your complaints about the NeoGeo making sense like that.

Does the Neo Geo have a similar bug?</div><br /><br />Drawing from back to front is simpler hardware-wise. To draw from front to back you have to read the line buffer before each write to check whether an already-drawn pixel is there. And there's no guarantee that drawing from front to back will look better--unless the sprites that get dropped are completely occluded by another sprite, you're still going to see that they're missing.<br /><br />I thought the SNES selected active sprites from front to back, but fetched and drew them from back to front. Seems more likely to be an attempt at a compromise than a &quot;bug&quot;. In practice time overs are much more likely than range overs, so the order sprites are selected in rarely makes a difference.<br /><br />I think the Neo Geo draws from back to front but I might be wrong. At least one of the Konami arcade sprite generators has a register bit that selects front-to-back or back-to-front drawing.

Integrated RAM can organized however you want--look at the NES color RAM (6 bits wide and with irregular mirrored &quot;holes&quot;) or its OAM for that matter.<br /><br />The video DAC in the Neo Geo is external to the video chips (it's a pair of SRAMs and a resistor network) The chips work entirely in indexed color space.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm pretty sure Metal Slug does that. I remember opening up the game and loading the files into Audacity as raw data and you could actually hear all the samples. They're not compressed in any way, but I bet sound samples are streamed directly from the cartridge to where neither CPU has access. I think it's a shame that more Neo Geo games didn't take more advantage of its FM channels, because the PCM abilities by themselves aren't that amazing for an arcade machine.

And if you're on Neo Geo, you can probably make a V ROM big enough for a Mellotron-style patch set where each pitch has a separate sample. (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellotron" class="postlink">Mellotron</a> was an early analog sampler that used sets of magnetic tapes, one per pitch.)
