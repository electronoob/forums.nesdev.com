		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tried my new PowerPak today on my PAL NES but with wierd results. Check out my mpeg-file I captured here:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.anes.se/powerpak.mpg">http://www.anes.se/powerpak.mpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />Image quality is poor but I'll guess you'll see the wierd stripes that appear. My connector in my NES is new!
<br />
<br />The same PowerPak works very good on my Famicom A/V, these bugs aren't there..
<br />
<br />Hints what's wrong?
<br />
<br />EDIT: Discovered the demo, "quantum_disco_brothers_by_wAMMA.nes" looks terrible aswell, BUT, when the logo comes up after a short while, *pow* the distorsions disappear! Have tried many (PAL) games but they all have distorsions..
<br />
<br />EDIT2: Me and my friends old "intro" <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://patpend.net/ftp/roms/nes/fade2black.lha">http://patpend.net/ftp/roms/nes/fade2black.lha</a><!-- m --> works without glitches (no distorsions at all!) Sounds like a powerpak software problem?

<br />
<br />The fact that the problem is console-dependent tells me that it's more likely hardware than software.

<br />
<br />Perhaps someone should write a CHR-RAM test ROM which writes different values to every CHR address ($0000-1FFF) and then checks to see if they read back the same.

<br />Has this ever been run on real hardware before?

<br />Dragon's Lair (E).nes - when the bat is flying on the first level
<br />Kirby's Adventure (E).nes - when I press start and bring up the pause menu.
<br />Metroid (E) [!].nes

<br />thought none of these has been as bad that smb3 movie.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />McDonaldland (E) [!].nes - was really screwed up in the tiles in the intro. seems to be mostly the sky tiles. !! Just tried this one in Nintendulator, bad header. =/
<br />New Zealand Story (E).nes - Like every second frame is black.

<br />
<br />* Cobra Triangle (E)
<br />Corrupted graphics
<br />
<br />* Duck Tales (E)
<br />After "Loading game..." has disappeared, the screen just goes black and nothing happens.
<br />
<br />* Ninja Gaiden (U) [!]
<br />Corrupted graphics, never gets past the title screen.
<br />
<br />* Super Mario Bros 2 (E) [!]
<br />Palette is bad in-game, hangs on the first level.
<br />
<br />
<br />I didn't have any problems with SMB3 though (but I only played the first two stages). The same problem that occurs in Super C happens in Probotector 2 (the european version of the game) so it's not an NTSC/PAL issue. Could be a bad header though (wrong mirroring?)
