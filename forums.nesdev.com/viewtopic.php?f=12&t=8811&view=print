<br />Has anyone tried them? Do they have the same feel as a genuine sned controller? I have the controllers from my retro duo but they just aren't as responsive as the real thing.The buttons just feel stiffer. Am I better of just getting some used genuine made by Nintendo controllers that aren't as wore out? I just don't want to get these and have them be no better than the retro duo controllers and I haven't had the best luck with 3rd party controllers.

<br />
<br />I'm sure they're shit, as I've never heard of any aftermarket controllers being good besides the touchpad NES ones.
<br />
<br />But a rebuild kit for your current controllers, only like $3-$4 and they'll work like new.

<br />"This is NOT an original SNES controller made by Nintendo! This prodouct is made by Innovation a 3rd party non licensed company not affiliated with Nintendo"
<br />
<br />They say Nintendo on them but are some of the worst 3rd party you could buy.
<br />
<br />Just buy some good used ones off ebay and clean em.  They aren't cheap ~$12 each but MUCH better.  Otherwise if your looking something cheap and 3rd party the "superpad" are about as good as third party gets IMO, but they are still junk...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Pretty much any recent SNES controller is going to be complete crap, especially any that come with a box on eBay.  PCB made of (almost literally) cardboard, incredibly thin rubber buttons, wires that are barely connected.  If you can buy it for $1-3, think of how amazingly cheaply they are constructed so the factory+distributer+reseller all still make a profit.
<br />
<br />Unless there is something physically broken most Nintendo controllers will work as new with just some cleaning on the PCB and button contacts.  Rubbing alcohol + cotton ball and they will feel great.  The cases can also go through the dishwasher top rack so they look great  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
