<br />
<br />"Fully [UV] erasable 27C020 EPROM pulls have straight full length leads.... Nice quality - no solder- full length leads- used. G13797".
<br />
<br />Are there any other surprises waiting in store for me?  I'd just hate to order a year's supply and regret it when they come in the mail.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that's what the "used" part refers to as well. I don't think they even make them in DIP packages anymore. I see them (and things like SRAM chips) all the time in older equipment, like 2400 modems and stuff, often even socketed, so pulls are a plentiful source. I believe the main source of degradation is in reprogramming. Those in devices would only have been programmed a few times. But I don't know much about this area, maybe someone else can offer more solid experience.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Unless it says otherwise, they're probably not blank (especially since it says "erasable", rather than "erased").  They are possibly stickers on the window, unless it says "cleaned" (not hard to do with alcohol/solvent and a razor).  If it doesn't work you can usually look at the chip itself, since there's a window.  I've had a couple bad EPROMs where you can see that one of those tiny bond wires in there is disconnected from the die.
<br />
<br />Do you want blank ones?  Do you plan on re-using them often?  One-time-programmable chips are a cheaper option if you want to solder them in.  I picked up a ton of M27C512 OTPs for cheap a while back, not sure if I'll ever use all of them.  The best possible option seems to be a VS Unisystem release.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I already got a VS unisystem board, I've just been delaying the actual wiring it up the part, ordering the jamma adapter and all that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I've bought some OTP's in the past (by accident actually), and they were cheap but I don't have a great success rate just soldering them in yet.  
<br />
<br />After shipping I averaged about a buck a piece for 40 reprogrammable 256k x 8's <a href="http://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/prodinfo.asp?number=G13797" class="postlink">here</a>, which seems like one hell of a deal even if a few don't work.  
<br />
<br />Thanks for the response(s)/advice and what's a vs unisystem?  Sounds like some geekworthy hardware.
