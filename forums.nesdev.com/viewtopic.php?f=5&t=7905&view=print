		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm surprised nobody started a topic on the subject yet since we joked so much about it.  Now that it came out, I must figure out a way to finish my own projects! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />My impression: I was not expecting much at all and it was not much by itself.  The only reason that I really played is because I knew about the franchise. This is the only reason to find the game "enjoyable".  
<br />
<br />There is a lot of sex related jokes.  The game seems stuck in the past to some degree regarding design and game play but in this case it's not a good thing.
<br />
<br />There is a lot of empty space, not enough action.  Level design is average to poor.
<br />
<br />Verdict: a 10$ bargain bin price would be appropriate, maybe 15$ but not the actual price at 60$.
<br />
<br />From the content of the game, I wouldn't be surprised that most of it come from the last 2 years they worked on it.
<br />
<br />Now that someone could finish it and if there is enough interest, I hope they can make something better out of it for another sequel... Maybe in 15 years!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So that is the game they have developed during 14 years ? I've hard about that, but that's pretty much all I know about it.
<br />
<br />Technology sure have changed a lot since 1997 so if they release it on a modern (2011) platform they probably had to rewrite completely the game engine a couple of times even if they didn't plan to use amazing graphics or whatever.
<br />
<br />Therefore : if you want to develop a game for 14 years do it on the NES as it will not get more obsolete than what it already it  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As far as I'm concerned, the "work" didn't take <em>14 years</em>. The game was probably done much before its release. Unfortunately, it was just "finished whatever it was", with a twist - updated for (sort of) modern graphics. I believe the original had the same look of Duke 3D.
<br />
<br />Anyway, it's seems to be an old game being released in present times. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> No, I didn't play it yet.
