<br />My point was just that if it's repressed to download a ROM, then it should repressed to download a ROM and put it on a cart. This is purely logical. However, it seems people on this board are very careful about not linking any commercial ROMs being afraid of Nintendo coming here and shutting down the site.
<br />HOWEVER Nintendo could also shut down the site if we help people to make fake carts. Maybe I didn't word this well in my original post, and I should apologize for that. Nobody wants Nesdev to go down with something stupid for that, especially since ALL those guys come just to ask questions how to do devcarts and go sell them somewhere else.
<br />[quote]
<br />So you are also saying anyone posting NSFs should be warned/locked too?  Nobody wants Nesdev to disappear because they post copyrighted materials everywhere.  Also need to remove any homebrews with copyrighted graphics, or trademarked characters.  PowerPak mappers include the FDS BIOS, remove all mention of them too.  Somehow I doubt your crusade will extend to those, showing legality is not your actual reason.

The judge didn't believe her.<br /><br />Nintendo DS flash cards fulfill much the same function as the PowerPak: they allow running code from a microSD card.

Nintendo managed to convince judges in a couple countries that the homebrew use doesn't justify the piracy use.

<br />We already ban direct links to the PowerPak mapper archive, though it was originally for a different reason: at the time I noticed the problem, it had full copies of three Mario games, apparently used by bunnyboy for testing hardware before it goes out the door.
<br />
<br />As for NSFs, I asked about those before, and there was no consensus to discourage them. If something happens to vgmusic.com or snesmusic.org, on the other hand, I might change my tune.

<br />
<br />
<br />ROM's is different just because it's use able on a cart then can lead to fakes and lots of problems with the Nintendo's usage and us stealing customers  from VC because of emulators. I also agree we should be strict on this and anyone who asks might be able to receive help in PM's or even on the forums legally to make a "development cart" for that particular specs for the game.

<br />I wouldn't sweat it too much. vgmusic has been up for over a decade. The HVSC has also been available for a very long time, as has Zophar's NSF archive. And there are other examples, like ProjectAY and Project2612, the smspower VGM archive, various MDX archives, etc.
<br />They've had plenty of time to make an issue of these music rips/logs had they wanted to.

<br />But don't get <em>too</em> strict about it, especially in <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl108.html" class="postlink">102(b) cases</a>. Otherwise, you'd have rejected several of tokumaru's topics as "I want to make a counterfeit Sonic" and two of my topics about LJ65 (<a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4647" class="postlink">1</a> | <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4754" class="postlink">2</a>) as "I want to make a counterfeit Tetяis". Then it would have taken longer to discover and characterize an OAM refresh bug.
<br />
<br />Proposed wording: "Don't ask how to make a cartridge from the ROM image of a commercial game or a prototype game from the NES's commercial era. With very few exceptions, it's copyright infringement, and as of 2010, we've seen a lot of people go on to sell them as counterfeit prototypes.

<br />But the last time we tried to institute rules specific to nesdev.com/bbs, there was a <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4319" class="postlink">backlash</a>.

<br />
<br />Well I think the point to make is that making bootlegs doesn't add any value to NES development. It's just the creation of a bootleg and the possible destruction of parts in limited supply. The PowerPAK is in another category than just a reproduction. The PowerPAK can be used for both piracy as well as legitimate development. Bootlegs are just bootlegs. Asking how to make a bootleg though is the same thing as asking how to potentially put your homebrew onto a cartridge which makes that information being available somewhat legitimate. The problem though is we have good reason to believe that many people that come asking for the information that is already out there, are not developing their own new NES software.

<br />
<br />And I pretty much agree with tepples too. We should somehow get stricter, but without being total bastards of course - that wasn't ever my intentions, and this is why I got angry when people blamed me for wanting to ban people - which I never intended to !! There is a whole load of difference between just being warned and/or see your thread locked (a minor issue) and being banned (which is a major, permanent issue).

You're right that some people get off on playing devil's advocate, but it's not always out of bad faith. Pointing out flaws in an argument, even one that you personally support, encourages proponents of the argument to make it stronger.</div>
<br />
<br />I guess that's right, however when somebody SYSTEMACICALLY says things like if I was ALWAYS wrong, I find that a bit irritating.
<br />I can be wrong I don't deny it - but puting arguments in a foregin language isn't really easy, and having them bashed like that isn't very cool.
<br />
<br />Apparently, some people here seems like they didn't get the actual reason I oppose people asking questions related to bootlegs / fake carts (they are fake, as opposed to the original released by Nintendo - even if they have no kind of label. Maybe "fake" is not the correct english word, I didn't lear the WHOLE dictionary, if you have anything better please share).
<br />
<br />I tried to express all my reasons in the first post of this thread, but maybe I was expending too much or not being clear enough.
<br />
<br />1) I don't oppose to people earning money honestly (hey everyone has to earn money somehow to live, thank you I knew that ! - that wasn't the point) and I am not opposed to people modifying carts for development purpose.
<br />
<br />2) I am also personally not opposed to people playing ROMs on their PC or their Power Pak, or even fake carts they made, even if it's illegal, because I consider such games were released sufficiently long ago so that downloadig them doesn't hurt the copyright holders economically. That is out topic anyway, just that no I am not opposed to this.
<br />
<br />3) I am however opposed to people asking information about blatantly illegal stuff on Nesdev, because it could lead to trouble on the site.
<br />
<br />4) I am opposed to people selling fake catrs, whenver they try to pass it as a prototype, or they put it a label on it to make it belive it is a real one (even if the game wasn't released). The reason for that is that they asked us how to do this, and sell them to someone as a rare NES cart as opposed to saying it's a fake one and has no collectible value.
<br />So all of us, who spent time to help the "guy" to make his cart, the scammed buyer, and the translator of the game, are being f*** in the ass. You can't say the guy does honnestly earn his life to feed his wife/children that way, this makes NO sense.
<br />
<br />In short I'm not opposed on them earning money, but I'm on them earning money's on OUR and [insert the bootleged game's developers]'s work, when they did literally nothing to earn it.
<br />
<br />5) Eventually I am opposed to the fact more and more people come on Nesdev on the SOLE purpose of doing themselves fake carts, when it adds nothing to nes development. We spend time to explain them how to do it - we take the risk of being in legal trouble - but the "guy" doing the cart at best just plays the game (even though it's not necessary to make a cart to play it thanks to emulators !) - at worst he scams someone.
<br />In all cases, this adds nothing to the nesdev comunauty, therefore such "trolls" are indesirable.
<br />
<br />I haven't even mentioned the parts in limited supply - as I feel like there is enough terrible NES games so that it's not a major problem. But it's true it could become a problem for some particular boards. For instance I wouldn't be surprised if it's now impossible to find a FC2NES adapter in an early USA game, as they probably were already all destroyed to be used to play FC games on a NES, something similar could happen to a particular donor game for a particularly popular bootleg.
<br />
<br />Hopefully now people will understand my point of view better - and will answer with solutions and not by bashing my arguments with other lame arguments such as "yeah they illegaly make money and what ? is it a problem ?"

Despite earthbound being all over ebay, people still try to sell it and still get huge money for it because they say it's unreleased and rare, but yet, over at most sites, you can order a repro for $30 or so. I hate that too. But yet, when you don't research online before buying something, I guess you kind of deserve it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br />Selling a repro as a repro is fine IMO. Just don't say other stuff that isn't true and don't try to dress it up as a devcart for that game back when it was being developed with a sticked on the front and two holes. And even then, prototypes should have prototype Nintendo long boards in them, so again, research before buying can make it obvious that what your buying is fake.
<br />
<br />
<br />Yeah, I say we try to find a way that we can let people know how to make what they want, but we have to decide on a way to point them to the right direction and not make it obvious we're helping despite we're going to say we're not going to.

I don't know why some people here have such a problem with the free market, and the idea that someone somewhere is doing something that others find of value, and is getting paid for it. Fraud is another thing entirely, of course, but I see a lot of focus on things unrelated to that.</div>
<br />
<br />Whether fraudulent or not, most NES fans agree that mass game destruction is not a positive development.
<br />
<br />The PowerPak, which is made without destroying anything already made/valuable, doesn't compare. But it does seem that bunnyboy may have priced his goods too high, considering that the last guy to ask about the boards complained about the power pak's high price. Mass production has its virtues, after all.

<br />And maybe the person who made that stadium events cart used info here. I'm sure they didn't reverse engineer the hardware on the board, it only makes sense since this site has amazing info and docs. But yeah, not even prototypes, but fakes in general.
