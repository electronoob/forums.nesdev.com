		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey dudes!!!
<br />
<br />I recently bought a NES from a flea-market.
<br />It included some games and gamegenie with a loose SLROM board on it.
<br />
<br />So when I got home, I wanted to play the nes.
<br />Mario1+Duckhunt played fine, Track and Field 2 played fine, the Pirate Multicart that came with it played fine, so here I go...the SLROM board.
<br />
<br />first NOTHING!
<br />
<br />Cleaned the contact of both the board and the game genie....it kind of worked. artifacts on screen but the game genie booted. I didn't put in any codes and pressed start.
<br />
<br />it's DOUBLE DRAGON!
<br />
<br />Cleaned the contacts some more.....still weird screen, so I couldn't wait to take the roms off the board and take em to some radio amatuer that lives here.
<br />After getting over there and looking up the pinouts of the chips he rewired a romsocket and placed that on a rom socket in his programmer.
<br />
<br />He actually dumped the full contents of both PRG and CHR rom and with UCON I converted it to iNES format to see if it worked.
<br />
<br />Nintendulator crashed and I looked at the HEADER.....it had a mapper0 header, so I changed it by looking at a verified dump of double dragon.
<br />
<br />It works!!
<br />
<br />But I noticed some difference in the titlescreen:
<br /><img src="http://www.nesworld.com/yabbfiles/Attachments/01.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />after starting the game, I noticed another difference at the bottom of the screen:
<br /><img src="http://www.nesworld.com/yabbfiles/Attachments/03.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />When I wanted to pause the game I skipped a scene/stage.....
<br />
<br />is this a hack of some sort? or is this a beta/review cartridge ?

<br />
<br />But pressing start to skip a level doesn't mesh with that, it'd almost have to be a modified ROM (which MaskROMs can't be).

<br />
<br />Nope, the credits are handled by the Z80/control part of the system, and I don't think the game can access the dip switch settings.  VS games can, but I don't think Double Dragon was one.

<br />A prototype ROM, under the GoodNES name of "Double Dragon (J) (Beta)", matches what this guy is showing - the grey-panted Williams enemies, the "Free Play" sign, and the level skip.

<br />Sounds awfully alike huh?
<br />I guess this whole "Flea Market" is the intro to a scam. It sounds so unoriginal too.

People doesn't sell loose SLROM board into flea markets (altough I wish they does, when I see NES games for sale it's frustrating not to know which board it uses, as it's hard to know all the list by heart and of course it's always games that I don't know which board they uses).
