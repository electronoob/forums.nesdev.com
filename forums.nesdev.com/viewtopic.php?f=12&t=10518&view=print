		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here are some logic analyzer pics of the 65816 CPU interface to the S-SMP (the first 8 signals) and the primary control signals on the S-DSP (the last 7 signals). The logic analyzer was set to internal sampling at 250MHz. The duty cycle and period measurements shown below are not going to be exact but they will be within +/- 4ns. The logic analyzer was set to trigger when a CPU read of $2140 returned the value $AA after the SNES was reset. The trigger point was set to the 10% position. I only captured 32K samples but I can capture more than that. The game running is SMW, probably doesn't make much of a difference though.<br /><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/high_level.jpg" class="postlink">High-Level View (shows all samples)</a><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/med_level.jpg" class="postlink">Medium-Level View (shows zoomed in selection of samples)</a><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/CPUK_duty.jpg" class="postlink">CPUK Duty Cycle</a><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/CPUK_period.jpg" class="postlink">CPUK Period</a><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/PD3_duty.jpg" class="postlink">PD3 Duty</a><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/PD3_period.jpg" class="postlink">PD3 Period</a><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/CE0x_duty_ignore.jpg" class="postlink">CE0x Duty</a> (Edit1=Added, Edit2=Ignore)<br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/CE0x_period_ignore.jpg" class="postlink">CE0x Period</a> (Edit1=Added, Edit2=Ignore)<br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/snes_schematic_color.png" class="postlink">SNES Schematic (for reference)</a><br /><br />Some interesting things to note:<br />- The CPUK frequency is 2.048MHz as I stated in a previous post regarding CPUK. But here is the proof if anyone wanted it. I could get some o-scope screenshots too, but there's really no need at this point.<br />- It seems quite clear to me that PD3 is the &quot;clock-enable&quot; signal to the SMP. The PD3 signal is high on every other rising edge of CPUK, making the SMP's effective clock frequency 1.024MHz.<br />- I'm still trying to figure out what PD2 is. It would seem to me that PD2 must be the read/write strobe to the DSP so that the DSP chip can know whether the SMP is reading/writing to SRAM (so that the SRAM WEx/OEx signals can be driven appropriately). However, if you look at the WEx and OEx signals they seem to be perfectly periodic, as if they were clocks. I think this must just be something that I don't understand yet about how the SNES audio works. (I have only just started looking at this stuff). Any insights?<br />- Looking at the high-level image the CE0x strobe is also another perfectly periodic signal. Any insights?<br /><br />--<br /><br />EDIT1: Added CE0x measurements.<br />EDIT2: Ignore CE0x measurements as the signal shown as CE0x/CE1x/OEx/WEx are actually different signals.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So like I said in my previous post I have confirmed the behavior/purposes/direction of the PD2 and PD3 signals that run between the S-SMP and S-DSP.<br /><br />PD3 = Clock-Enable signal from S-DSP to S-SMP. PD3 is high on every other rising edge of CPUK. Making the effective clock frequency 1.024MHz.<br /><br />PD2 = Tri-state control signal from S-SMP to S-DSP. This signal is used by the S-DSP's MD bus I/O buffers to control when it should drive the MD bus (on a write to SRAM), or tri-state the MD bus (on a read from SRAM). You can see in the high and medium level zoom screencaps below how the PD2 signal coincides with the S-DSP's WEx strobe.<br /><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/high_level2.jpg" class="postlink">High-Level View (shows all samples)</a><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/med_level2.jpg" class="postlink">Medium-Level View (shows zoomed in selection of samples)</a><br /><br />And here is a capture of the 65816 trying to read $AA, then $BB from $2140 during the ROM bootstrapping. It fails the first two times then succeeds the 3rd time. It fails because the SMP was still busy zero-filling RAM during the first two attempts.<br /><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/TLA/2140_AA_BB_read.jpg" class="postlink">$2140 Reads</a><br /><br />I will update my schematic with this new information.<br /><br />UPDATE: Schematics updated: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/schematics/snes_schematic.zip" class="postlink">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36237540/SNES/jwdonal/schematics/snes_schematic.zip</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This SPC700 IPL boot rom is screwy. Not only does it put the stack at $01EF instead of $01FF as everyone is well aware, but it only ever clears addresses $EF-$01 of the zero page. It doesn't ever even clear $FF or $00.  This was throwing me off because i was trying to trigger my LA on the last write to $00 but it wasn't triggering. I had thought there was something wrong with my trigger settings. Anomie's spc700.txt is actually wrong on this. The disassembly of the ROM says that it clears the zero page, but it doesn't. It only mostly does...haha.

I wonder if there is similar observed bias with the NTSC and PAL S-CPU clock rates.<br /><br />Current guesses are 21477272hz for NTSC, and 21281370hz for PAL. That number comes from NES emulators though, I don't know that anyone's ever actually tested the PAL CPU clock speed before.

That would cause the audio pitch to shift upwards by about two cents relative to a perfect oscillator. I think that's close enough.<br /><br />The main oscillator must have much better regulation; NTSC requires that the oscillator be within ±0.0003% of the nominal value. Too far away from that, and there won't be any color. (PAL most likely has similar requirements, although I haven't found the exact value yet.)
