		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, friends! I'm a total noob in programming, but I would like to try to learn NES programming . I know, it's not an easy task, but I'm not ambitious in my desires, just want to test myself in that sphere of life:) There's  already a lot of information about NES programming on the internet and I will try to check it out, but my main question of  this topic is: &quot;Is there a way to use my android tablet (4.0.3) to make the whole NES game including music? is that theoreticaly and practicaly possible?&quot;<br />I know using PC is more convinient and has lots of means for NES dev. but for me it  would be much more pleasant to learn without noise that PC produces <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> just can't stand it in creative work and, unfortunately, have no money for a laptop. (and for the tablet I connect mouse + keyboard, so it's like a laptop:)<br />I'm sorry for my English and thank you for your attention in advance! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

But you would have to find a way how to write Android apps under Android first, and it is so much extra work that it just makes no sense to go through all this.<br /><br />I think, using PC along with a pair of earplugs, or maybe headphones with nice music, would be much easier.

It looks like it's really better to use some earphones with PC than doing that extra work that will kill me  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you've rooted your tablet, you can install a GNU operating environment inside Android. At that point, you can load ca65 and the rest of the toolchain. Or you can put an X server or VNC viewer on your tablet and put in a PC in a different room and then run the toolchain on that. But with the end of production of netbooks, I do find it important to have some sort of toolchain that can run completely on an ASUS Transformer tablet.
