IMO the graphics just look... rounder, not more detailed.

Perhaps what the roundness does is make 8-bit game graphics look more like an illustration (or a modern Flash game based on the principles of traditional illustration) than like an obsolete video game. Consider that the first of these algorithms (EPX, which produces identical results to Scale2x) was originally an aid in porting games to a platform with more pixels as a starting point for tweaks that add detail. If you want more detail in particular games, feel free to contribute high-resolution texture packs, such as CHR banks with 16x16 pixel tiles.

For example, games that are cartoon-like will benefit more from the kind of round look that these filters produce.

I have some ideas about how to handle them using a hash table, which I'll explain in more detail once CHR ROM games are working as in step 1.

Most 2D graphics and games are not about realism. The graphics communicate a particular mood which this filter significantly alters. That's the point here. The problem as I understand it is that upscaling graphics requires <em>some</em> kind of filling-in-the-blanks to avoid them looking blurry. This filter is an alternative to big pixels, which also are not what the games looked like on TVs back then.

The increased resolution really helps the 3D objects though, but that's a very different case. 3D objects are not constrained by the resolution of the display, so rendering them at higher resolutions is simple and effective.
