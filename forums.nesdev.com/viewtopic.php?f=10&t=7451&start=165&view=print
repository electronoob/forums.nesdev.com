<br />Yes, I feel I'm making progress.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  <span style="color: #888888">But, it was too weird and so I changed back to the ROL and so now </span>after pressing <span style="color: red">select</span> it does something... my meta-sprite returns to the left-hand side of the screen... and then, after that, the controls start working normaly. Each button only completes its ppurpose one time per press.   So, it kindof works more now... but if i dont press <span style="color: red">select</span>, the directional pad does nothing.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />
<br />
<br />edit:  I changed it back to <span style="color: violet">ROL</span> because I wanted to see if <span style="color: red">select </span>worked.  With the <span style="color: violet">ROR</span> I could only press directions on the directional pad.  After changing it to <span style="color: violet">ROL</span> I updated my BUTTON definitions: 
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BUTTON_RIGHT .equ #00000001b<br />BUTTON_LEFT&nbsp; .equ #00000010b<br />BUTTON_DOWN&nbsp; .equ #00000100b<br />BUTTON_UP&nbsp; &nbsp; .equ #00001000b<br />BUTTON_START .equ #00010000b<br />BUTTON_SELECT equ #00100000b<br />BUTTON_B&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.equ #01000000b<br />BUTTON_A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.equ #10000000b</div>
<br />(They're in the wrong order but that doesn't matter <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.)  The <span style="color: violet">ROL</span> started to work right... kindof, <span style="color: red">Select</span>, <span style="color: red">Start</span>, <span style="color: red">B</span>, and <span style="color: red">A</span> worked now. And now the other half doesn't work... It's the same problem on BOTH <span style="color: violet">ROL AND ROR</span>!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  <span style="color: red">Select</span> doesn't play the famitone song, but it does fix whatever is wrong with my controller reading code.   After pressing <span style="color: red">select</span> all the buttons do something.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />Isn't the stack inverted?  Is that why you say, "I use a good part of page 1 for variables, starting at $0100"?

<br />Page 0=$0000-$00FF
<br />Page 1=$0100-$01FF
<br />
<br />And so on. Page 1 is the stck area, it's hard wired. Phen you put something on it, it DE-INCREMENTS the stack. So when you load the stack with FF (LDX #$FF, TXS) it's at the highest point. Most people don't use all of the stack, so sometimes random variables go into the unused space, despite the stack being there. I don't put any there myself, but if I need to, they're going there. I doubt I'll need it though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I just meant that since I don't use the whole stack, I put variables in the unused space. So while the stack grows from $1FF down, I have variables from $100 up. As long as the variables don't touch the deepest level my stack goes, that's fine.

<br />
<br />Most people just keep 2 button state bytes, one with the buttons that are currently pressed (regardless of their state in the previous frame), and one with the buttons that are pressed now but weren't last frame (i.e. new buttons). Both of them are useful in games.

<br />I see absolutely no reason for you to be monkeying around with the stack.
<br />
<br />I must remind you that copying and pasting code around just to "see if it works" is a terrible way to program. Things end up working by pure luck, meaning you don't learn anything (because you don't know <strong>why</strong> they worked) and your programs aren't reliable at all, since different circumstances could easily break them.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I just want to add that what I meant in my previous messages is that for some game events you should use <strong>currControllerButtons</strong> (walking, jumping - if you have variable jump heights -, etc.), but for others you should use <strong>newControllerButtons</strong> (menu navigation, shooting, etc.).
