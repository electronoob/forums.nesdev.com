		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How many NES games out there don't use scrolling at all? Even the ones that didn't use scrolling in-game used scrolling in the title screen (although maybe those are playable if you can get past the title screen without looking at it).<br /><br />Surprised it didn't at least try to do per-tile scrolling, but then again way more surprised that a PC-8801 is emulating a NES when it's a <em>weaker</em> system o_____O;

The emulator definitely wouldn't be able to work properly with those. Also I just noticed it just trims off the bottom of the screen... Weird it doesn't try to center it instead =S<br /><br />That said, does anybody know what logic is it using to determine the color of the sprites? I mean, obviously all the sprites are the same color, but Mario and Luigi in that screenshot look different despite being the same tiles.

The emulator uses planes R and G for the background, and plane B for drawing the sprites on. The sprites are fixed at white (I'm not sure, but I think each plane can actually set to display whatever colour you want, so the RGB are just names of the planes and it's not mandatory for each plane to be coloured the same as its name). I suppose the emulator assigns white or black pixels to a sprite depending on the colour value of the original pixels, so darker colours become black and lighter ones become white. Maybe it considers the red colour used in Mario darker than the green used in Luigi, so the Mario sprite has black pixels on it (or the opposite? as I couldn't tell which character is Mario and which is Luigi).<br /><br />Also, only horizontal flipping for sprites is implemented (by using LUT if I'm not mistaken). Vertical flipping is not implemented.<br /><br />[s]Correction on Hamtaro's original info: The emulator supports only 16kb prg and 8kb chr.[/s]<br /><br /><strong>Edit as I forgot to mention it originally:</strong><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Almost reminds me of the NES emulator for GBC.</div><br />That emulator was actually coded by the <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/submarine600/html/gbnes.html" class="postlink">same person</a>.
