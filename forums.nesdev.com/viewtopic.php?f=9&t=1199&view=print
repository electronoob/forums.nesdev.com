		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all, 
<br />I want to build the CopyNes from the schematics provided by Kevin Horton. I understand them in 99%, this 1% are connections of the pins of 6522... Data (D0-D7) need to be connected to the nes processor and other pins mentioned in his notes, but which exactly ? Here is a <a href="http://img65.imageshack.us/img65/6539/6522pinout3qc.gif" class="postlink">6522 pinout</a> , I marked the pins which I don't know where to connect (marked with "?"). I would buy his Kit, and just build it, but I have only famicom console, so it wouldn't help me though. That is why I decided to build a proto board, and then create a PCB for Famicom, not NES. I would be really grateful if someone could help me with this.
<br />
<br />PS I'm sorry, I know my Eng sucks ;/

<br />
<br />CB1/2, CA1/2 are not connected.   IRQ is not connected.
<br />
<br />D0-D7 connect to the CPU databus as you suspected.
<br />RS0 through RS3 connect to A0-A3 in that order.
<br />CS1 (pin 24) is +CE
<br />!CS2 (pin 23) is /CE
<br />R/W connects to R/W
<br />ph2 connects to M2
<br />!RST connects to /RST
<br />
<br />and that should about do it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're the man Kevin, thank you very much ^^ The main purpose for me to build your device, is the fact that I have few undumped famicom games, Ihope it would be possible to dump them.
<br />
<br />And one thing, I don't want to open a new topic, so I ask here - is there any schematic for NSF Cart for CopyNes ? or would it be possible to just add a 62256 with a CR2032 instead of the rom in mapper 0 cart ? I'd love to build one <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> nullsleep made a great job making the tutorial of how to convert the nsf to rom, and then put it onto the cart, but with time it is getting annoying, constant flash programming...So having such neat device which CopyNes undoubly is, would be a shame not to have the NSF Cart for it...
