<br />
<br />However, I can't think of any situation where this would be handy, but still, it's nice to know all of the useless stuff the NES is capable of doing, none the less. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />
<br />And yeah this would be pretty useless so that's probably why it wasn't done commonly. Even if a game has to show a completely static screens, you'd probably want to have it compressed to not waste 1k of data.

The primary display is of a horizon which changes angles depending on the roll of the jet. This is the only way of rapidly swapping name tables that need to change every frame (or close to it).
<br />
<br />I wounder if they filled the two internal RAM-based name tables from compressed data and utilized them as well?
<br />

<br />
<br />Maybe if you developed a mapper that could swap nametable ROM at a very fine scale, say 32 bytes each, you could do some sort of duplicate line compression.

<br />Someone made something like a FMV awhile ago that just used CNROM's abailty to have some huge amount of CHR-ROM.

A typical 8-bit register can address only 256 different nametables. If you plan to make your mapper on a CPLD, each latch costs you money.

<br />CNROM proper is limited to 32 KiB. Clone boards topped out at 64 or 128 KiB because a 74161 was cheaper than a 74377, which is what emulators are supposed to emulate if CHR ROM is bigger than 32 KiB.

<br />
<br />I didn't know mapper 68 boards had two CHR chips. I just assumed it was one chip as that is usually the case. 
<br />
<br />I'm aware actual CNROM boards are limited but the iNES implementation apparently allows for a full 8bit register which makes for a long of CHR-ROM.

<br />Hence the 377, which is a full 8-bit latch.
