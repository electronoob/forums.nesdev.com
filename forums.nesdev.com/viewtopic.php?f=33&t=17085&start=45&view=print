		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's three types: URL, contacts, and freeform text. Although on iOS at the very least, free text is instead interpreted as a search string piped to safari. Contacts will ask to add the info to your devices' contacts list. <br /><br />The problem with QR codes is that they're mostly only applied to ads or other messages of commercial intent, and most poeple don't walk about town scanning ads, they instead try to ignore them as good as they can, so QR codes are a largely misapplied tech many feel mistrustful of. I've never seen anyone scan an ad except for niched event posters/flyers. They had been more useful in situations where people actually might want to know more. <br /><br />There's always a security check when you scan a QR code: your phone or tablet will always ask you to confirm the scan. <br /><br />QR is better than an URL string as printed text whenever that URL has any information to the right of .domain/, because then you can almost be sure that noone's going to bother type that in. You can think of QR:s as links for the material world. For example if an art gallery or museum wants to link an object to a curated blog article, you'd use either QR or NFC.

People could update links as needed. Personally, I'm not sure I care. It's the nature of things that links eventually go out of date. I think including the links, (knowing full well that they'll eventually be broken) is fine.

So, by phrasing your opinion as &quot;players' wishes&quot; you are making a very bold and unearned claim. Sure, some players may not find the reveal, but honestly, it only takes a few tries to realize that shooting sequence is unbeatable. Curiosity should take care of the rest. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">How to handle Star Evil and other bait and switch games</div><br />Last I checked, <em>bait and switch</em> is specifically a negative term, used to refer to the use of advertising something desirable and delivering something undesirable of a notably lower quality.<br /><br />Star Evil is the exact opposite of bait and switch. It makes the player expect something of a very low quality, but delivers something unique and interesting. To most people, there is nothing desirable about <em>generic-looking remake of already generic space shooter from a notoriously low-quality multicart</em>. I'm honestly bewildered by the fact that the basis of your argument seems to be &quot;people will be disappointed the game isn't actually a crappy space shooter.&quot;<br /><br />Moreover, the argument keeps being brought up that a customer would be disappointed after buying the game, but aside from the reasons already mentioned, that argument still seems to make no sense:<br /><br />The screenshot and description occur in the menu, not on the game packaging. That means that any potential customer would have made the purchase BEFORE seeing the screenshot or reading the description. Therefore, it's impossible for either to be a determining factor in their purchase.<br /><br />Also, the ROM will be available for free. So, if we're talking about customers who have had a chance to access the menu (those who have downloaded the ROM), they have also had a chance to play the games, and thus, experience the reveal on their own, in the way the author intended.<br /><br />Furthermore, as is evident by the balance of responses in this thread, more players would actually enjoy the reveal than would be disappointed, so the basis of  &quot;it's not how EA would market the game&quot; is really<br /><br /><blockquote style="margin-left: 1%; padding-left: 1%; border-left: 3px solid #555577;">
&quot;Of the very narrow group of people who will download the ROMs to read the menu<em> but not</em> play the games, the infinitesimally small number who <em>actually</em> think the game would be good based on the screenshot <em>and</em> who also think that the resulting game is not as good as &quot;generic space shooter&quot; <em>might</em> be disappointed.&quot;
</blockquote><br /><br />Also, proposed title for A53v4: <strong>Star Evil – It's Totally A Space Shooter Bundle: Quadruple Action 53 Vol. 4, Function 64… Did I Mention Star Evil Was A Space Shooter?</strong><br /><br />EDIT: typos
