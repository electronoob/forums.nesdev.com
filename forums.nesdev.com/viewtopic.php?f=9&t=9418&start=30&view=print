Which brings me to the second problem: whichever the case, you'd need to add in your own circuit to the Gremlins cart, because the top row of the chip (which is where the audio pins are located in the 5B at least) isn't connected to anything. Although I'm sure most of you lot could handle that part, it is far beyond my own capabilities (I'm a musician, nothing more). Lastly, I'm not exactly rich myself, and semi-rare Famicom games like these can cost quite a bit of money I can't afford to spend right now, so I wouldn't be the one financing this project I'm afraid.<br /><br />I do have a TNS-HFC3, however (it's in jarhmander's hands undergoing maintenance right now, but there's a good chance I'll have it back in working order). So if someone is willing to take the plunge and order one of these Gremlins carts, mod it and send it to me for testing, then sure I'll be glad to oblige - but there's probably not much I could do that someone with a Power Pak couldn't, anyway (swap tests etc.).

I've unsoldered the two rom chips on it and was about to put the Gimmick eproms on it but i got bored, and started hacking something else.<br /><br />If there's real interest i could finish the work and confirm whether or not 5a generates audio.

In any case I bought 3 more Gremlins carts, so while five units is not a huge statistical sample, if they are all 5A's I would consider the nescartdb Gremlin's 5b a fluke, and I'll abandon the idea.<br /><br />BTW I've completed my hack and the 5A doesn't seem to generate anything when playing Gimmick roms.<br />Does it generate anything else if i randomly write to its address space? No clue.<br /><br />I'll post more info on my blog soon.

Several cartridges with certain Konami VRC series ICs respond differently based on which lower address lines are connected to the mapper's register select lines. There are about 14 possible combinations, with nearly half of them attested. Likewise, it's possible to have the chips ignore certain enable signals output by the mapper by playing with how the signals are routed on the PCB.
