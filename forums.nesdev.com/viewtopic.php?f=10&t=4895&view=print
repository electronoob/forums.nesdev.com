		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To preface this discussion, I have very limited amounts of programming experience. Some BASIC years ago, and only a very little bit of C.
<br />
<br />Which microprocessor architecture would some of you recommend to someone that doesn't have much experience with assembly language? I suppose the ideal platform would be one with good tools, documentation, and emulators/simulators for testing code. Some processors off the top of my head are the Z80, x86, 6502, 6509, 6512, 68000, ARM, and TMS9900.
<br />
<br />I would imagine for a beginner, developing on a platform with a decent amount of BIOS routines would be helpful as well. Also, a platform is easy to learn, yet difficult to master to keep it interesting would be ideal as well.
<br />
<br />Would any of you share your experiences and thoughts? I'm interested in both learning and having some fun as well icon_smile.gif
<br />
<br />Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm sort of a noob here, but I do have experience with x86 assembly language. I taught myself years ago with a book by Jeff Duntemann called "Assembly Language: Step by Step." That book was a godsend. It is one of the clearest and most enjoyable programming books I've ever read. If you can get your hands on that book, and TASM or MASM, and use it on a computer with DOS (or use DosBox perhaps), I would highly recommend that. 
<br />
<br />*edit*
<br />
<br />Here is the book on amazon. I have the old copy with the black cover, but this version covers doing assembly programming on linux as well as dos (same book though so I'm sure still great):

<br />
<br />
<br />I haven't been doing nesdev long, but I can definitely say my prior x86 experience has made it relatively easy for me to learn some of the basics. Good luck!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i would suggest you learn the asm for what ever you are programming.  if you are writing nes emulator or game, then i would suggest 6502.
<br />
<br />if you are writing an application to run on an x86 cpu, then i would suggest learning x86.   you can use gcc -S with c source code to show the asm 
<br />
<br />i would not waste my time learning DOS or bios interrupt calls, those are deprecated and have no modern use.   (might i ask why you want to learn bios routines ?    i dont think windows or linux uses those at all, and i think bsd might still use 1)
<br />
<br />not sure i can suggest what to learn.  depends what you want to do with it.   i would suggest 6502, x86, or arm.
