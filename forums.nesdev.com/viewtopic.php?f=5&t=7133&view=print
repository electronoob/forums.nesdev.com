		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello all.  I have been getting lots of neato stuff done with my FPGA-based NES emulator (even in spite of the lack of posts on my blog XD ).  I now have a Qt GUI interface running on my PC which communicates over ethernet/uart to my FPGA development board.
<br />
<br />In the past I have recorded audio/vid from the board using Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (because it's free, easy-to-use and generates the most popular video format (i.e. flash)).  The NES video comes out of the board and I record it using my Epiphan VGA2USB device. The NES audio comes into my PC directly via a headphone style 3.5mm-to-3.5mm cable.  This works really well.
<br />
<br />However, I would now like to not only record the NES' audio/video but also the portion of my desktop which has my Qt GUI interface running.  I would like to have the NES video on one half of the movie and the desktop GUI operation on the other half (like a splitscreen thing).
<br />
<br />I'm more than willing to pay for a software package that can do this and it would also need to run on windows.  Can someone help me out?  I know someone knows how I could do this.

<br />
<br />For the split screen, if you don't mind doing some scripting, <a href="http://avisynth.org/" class="postlink">AviSynth</a> is a great video editor. It doesn't have a GUI, to do your editing you have to type the commands into an .AVS file, and when you open this file in a video player (or encoder, which is how you'll be able to save the result) the software does all the editing you requested in real time. The script to put two videos side by side should be very trivial.
<br />
<br />Also, about the video format, it's not that the codecs used by Flash are popular... You see, downloading an FLV is the same as downloading an MP4, an AVI or an MPG. What people don't want to do is download large files just to watch a few clips. This means that Flash videos are only any good if they can be viewed online just by clicking the "play" button, otherwise it doesn't matter. So just make an account on YouTube an upload your files there, it's the best way to share videos, and what will get you the most viewers.

<br />The good thing about AviSynth scripts is that they don't have to be well written at all, they just have to generate the desired results (an approach I don't usually recommend when making programs). So just take a look at some example scripts and keep the documentation open, and I'm sure you'll find a way to do what you want in no time.

A good program for that is <a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/" class="postlink">VirtualDub</a>. Just open the AVS file in it, go to Video-&gt;Compression to pick and configure a codec (you can do the same for the audio if you want to compress it, but you have to switch it to "Full processing mode" instead of "Direct stream copy", because the video is already set like that by default, but not the audio) and finally go to File-&gt;Save as AVI to generate the final file.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I am assuming that youtube will convert my AVI files to flash when I upload them...is that correct?</div>
<br />Yes, YouTube converts it for you. Just make sure you upload a file with decent video quality so that the result doesn't look like shit. Keep in mind that YouTube will be compressing your video for the 3rd time, so don't compress it too much during capture or in VirtualDub, because each time the video is compressed it loses quality.

<br />Hey Koitsu, that seems pretty easy to install and run (especially after watching the video)...but...how would I do a split-screen effect with it?  Would I still need to use AviSynth for that?
<br />
<br />Also, what codecs do ya'll like to use when making these videos?  What works best in most cases?  Is it more a matter of personal preference?  I have a pretty blazing fast machine so I should be able to record some high quality video without too much of a problem.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

I can record both my desktop and capture card video simultaneously, perform split-screen effects, add in-video notes, pan, zoom, have it automagically upload the videos to my youtube account and everything!!  And the video quality is awesome to boot.  It's $300 but I've only been using it for less than an hour and I can already tell that it's worth way more than that.  I'm going to continue the free 15-day trial for now but if it continues to be this awesome then I'm gonna buy a license for sure.

<br />
<br />You'd need video editing software to achieve split-screen effects and other whatnots.  Your original post stated that you wanted something that could record your desktop, so I provided such.  :-)
<br />
<br />Regarding codecs: you need to keep in mind that if the videos are for other people there's no guarantee they'll have the codec you used.  Lots of people find the whole "codec installation" thing a PITA (myself included).  Don't forget Macintosh and Linux users too.
<br />
<br />I tend to stick to XviD for video and LAME MP3 ACM for the audio (since XP's built-in MP3 codec doesn't permit higher bit-depth encodings for licensing reasons).  Regarding the audio piece, I use whatever bitrate I want, but the frequency I always have match that of the source (e.g. if recorded at 44kHz 16-bit I use 44kHz 16-bit in LAME MP3 ACM) and I do not use VBR.  Adjusting either of these can cause something you've probably seen before: where the audio gradually gets more and more out of sync with the video.
<br />
<br />XviD codec really isn't intended for things like desktop recording, it's intended for things like film.  There *are* codecs out there specifically intended for "screen capture" stuff -- meaning their compression algos are focused around general desktop composition.  However, as I said before, these codecs aren't always available for all platforms and require people to install them.  YMMV.  I still use XviD even for desktop recording because most people have it already, and if they don't, it's a single no-bullshit installation executable.
<br />
<br />For the actual encoding process, I use VirtualDub, but AviSynth would be totally fine too (assuming you want to deal with writing the scripts yourself).
<br />
<br />Finally, I don't recommend doing both recording and encoding (via codec) at the same time.  Sure, you can do this, but even a hefty multi-core machine will drop frames as a result.  It gets exponentially worse the higher the source resolution; I have a Q9550 (quad-core) CPU, for example, and doing both full desktop (1920x1200) recording + XviD + LAME MP3 encoding all at the same time does drop quite a lot of frames.
<br />
<br />You're better off recording straight to AVI (with both raw audio and video).  Yes the file will be gigantic (multiple gigabytes, depending on the recording length, resolution, etc..), but it gives you the chance to do clean-up and post-processing before encoding.  Otherwise you end up trying to edit a pre-encoded video, then you have to re-encode it again once you make the final cut (which looks like shit; kinda like how people rip DVDs to DivX files; DVD is already MPEG, so they're compressing already-compressed video, which results in Double Blotchy Funtime MPEG Artifact Joy!)

Let's do the math: 1920x1200 pixel video at 24 bpp and 30 fps is 1920*1080*24*30 = 1.5 Gbps, which would saturate the bandwidth of the first version of SATA, let alone the bandwidth of the disks connected to it. To record without even a lossless codec such as Huffyuv, one would need 3 Gbps SATA, which means a pretty fat RAID.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">kinda like how people rip DVDs to DivX files; DVD is already MPEG, so they're compressing already-compressed video, which results in Double Blotchy Funtime MPEG Artifact Joy!</div>
<br />But what's the alternative to transcoding if you 1. don't want to move 8 GB files around for a <em>standard</em> definition video and 2. don't have millions of dollars to shoot your own movie?

<br />Well, maybe not the final, multi-pass, size-oriented, slow encoding, but you have so use <em>some</em> sort of compression when capturing. You simply can't escape having to encode the same video a couple of times, unless you plan to work exclusively with resolutions close to 320x240 a few minutes at a time. Just make sure you use high bitrates for the intermediate encodes and the final result shouldn't suffer too much from artifacts of previous compressions.

<br />UPDATE:
<br />I fixed the video quality (I updated the link above). I figured out the "secret sauce" to uploading videos to youtube and getting HD quality.  Sweet!!! If you want to see my video in super high-quality click the box at the bottom of the player window and change the resolution to 720p. Oh, and here is the secret sauce video that I found which told me how to get HD quality on youtube using camtasia:
