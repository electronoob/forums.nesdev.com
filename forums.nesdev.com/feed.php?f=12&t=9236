The downside of batch PCB services like iTead is the long lead time.  It easily takes a month to 6 weeks minimum before you get your order back.  But their quality is excellent.  Even though they allow traces down to 6mil, I'd suggest staying at 10 or greater.  Also, I emailed them and they said that they are capable of producing &quot;gold fingers&quot; (the fabrication name for cart edge connectors), so you're good there.  Also, depending on the features you need, check out FusionPCB SeeedStudio as well.  I believe they use the same fab house as iTead (meaning same quality), but they offer different price breakdowns for different features.  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion-pcb-service-p-835.html">http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion ... p-835.html</a><!-- m --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Tue Aug 21, 2012 12:01 pm</p><hr />

Wow, this PCB service is actually the cheapest I've seen! They should work perfectly! They even provide Eagle DRC rules which will make my life far easier. <br /><br />Qwertymodo, I'll keep my eyes on this thread for EAGLE libraries if you would like to post your work. So far I've been using the library for SD2SNES which I pulled out of their GIT. Yours sounds like it would work better given you have explicitly designed it to fit the 10cm requirement. <br /><br />Thanks a lot for this info!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5646">Farthom</a> — Tue Aug 21, 2012 9:42 am</p><hr />

Yeah, I'm fine open sourcing my library.  It's a bit of a mess at the moment, so give me a bit to clean things up a little and I'll send it your way.  I'd prefer if you didn't publish the library (mostly because it's a work in progress right now), but schematics can be published without including the libraries without any issues (the only thing is that anyone who downloads the schematic without the library can't edit the footprints).  If somebody asks you for the library, I'm fine with you giving it out, I would just rather it not get posted publicly for the time being (again, only due to the current WIP status, I plan to publish it myself eventually).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Mon Aug 20, 2012 2:54 pm</p><hr />

I am interested in the eagle outlines, I have quite a bit of prep work for the schematic of some carts, and the outlines would help get a jumpstart on an open source cart layout.<br /><br />That is assuming that you are willing to give away your outlines in an open source project.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5026">rkrenicki</a> — Mon Aug 20, 2012 11:13 am</p><hr />

Yes, you are correct that the proper thickness is 1.2mm (I just measured one to confirm).  Check out iTead Studios, they offer a 2-layer 10cmx10cm board for $22, no extra charge for 1.2mm thickness (thicknesses &lt;1.0mm are reasonably cheap) <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imall.iteadstudio.com/open-pcb/pcb-prototyping/im120418002.html">http://imall.iteadstudio.com/open-pcb/p ... 18002.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Also, if you're interested, I have a PCB outline in EAGLE for all 3 of the standard board shapes (the tiny, no-RAM boards, the standard board, and the large board with the expansion wings).  I had to shave the edges down ~1mm on each side to fit within the 10cm size requirement, but they should still fit snug.  If you're interested, let me know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5348">qwertymodo</a> — Mon Aug 20, 2012 10:27 am</p><hr />

Hello all,<br /><br />I've recently become quite interested in SNES and SNES hardware. I'm by no means an expert on the subject matter, thus I'm looking to learn as much as I can by starting up a small project. Simply put, I'm looking to drop a nice FPGA chip into a game cartridge, and using it as a learning tool. I wont go into the details but I'm looking to get a PCB board manufactured. The issue is, from my searching SNES cartridge PCB boards are 1.2mm thick, while 99% of PCB printing companies will print you 1.6mm. (Some offer 0.8mm)<br /><br />I figure a 1.6mm would damage the snes cardedge connector, while the 0.8mm would make an unreliable connection. Do you know of any companies willing to print 1.2mm boards, at a fair price?<br /><br />I've found makepcb.com will print them, but I feel that company is sketchy and has had accuracy problems. (Plus reported 8-10 week delivery time)<br />I've also found apcircuits.com however they seem to charge a heavy premium for 1.2mm boards. (Upwards of 400 bucks)<br /><br />Does anyone know of others?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Matt<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5646">Farthom</a> — Sun Aug 19, 2012 2:44 pm</p><hr />
