Il post a pic that may show what I mean.ignore the colours displayed, I know there not nes, I'm just experimenting.

This means that the NES doesn't know any difference. It treats mario's feet the same way it does mario's head and goombas: single, independent sprites.<br /><br />Just remember, there is a 8x16 sprite mode in NES, in that case both the upper and lower part of that sprite use the same palette.

Unlike the background loading up 16x16 that uses only four colours in 8x8 tiles from the 16 available background pallete(1 colour in each pallete of 4 being the same. The sprites 8x8 tiles can use 1 pallete of 4 colours from the 16 available colours(1 same colour being used for transparency in each) unless I would use the 8x16 Sprite mode, in which case 2 8x8 tiles next to each other horizontally or vertically would have to use the same 4 colour Pallete?<br /><br />most of or all the NES games I have seen at least would suggest that the 8x16 Sprite mode was used a lot, why is that, PAL systems? Be interesting to know.<br /><br />I appreciate your comments helping and I apoligise if you are find yourselves going over old stuff here. I'm not a nes dev, I'm just amateur pixel artist learning the trade, and trying to create genuine looking nes assets, so I want to get it right as much as i can, so your advice is crucial to my research and learning. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Also, this is a global setting, so ALL sprites on screen must be the same size.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">most of or all the NES games I have seen at least would suggest that the 8x16 Sprite mode was used a lot, why is that, PAL systems? Be interesting to know.</div><br />Early games tended to use 8x8, which are conceptually simpler to work with, but as time went on people started expecting video game characters to be bigger, and using 8x16 meant, in theory, that the coverage was doubled. In practice, that was not the case, since some of the sprites would contain empty space.

That sounds odd. Or do you mean if I use the 8x16 Sprite mode then every other Sprite needs to use the same, that sounds right. Just making sure I understand what your saying.<img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Just going back to what I posted first, can I use a different pallet selection for each 8x8 tiles when using sprites, and if in 'Sprite mode' different pallete for each 8x16.? (See pic) sorry for the scribble. Have I got it right?

And all of these unused bits in both versions have to be filled with transparency, so there's a lot of empty-seeming space.<br /><br />There's nothing that says the individual components have to be aligned on the grid. Skewing things sometimes can help.

The hardware is 100% unaware of what you'd consider a &quot;character&quot;. Any character can use any number of sprites. But if the total of all the characters currently on screen requires more than 64, the NES couldn't display all of it in the same frame.<br /><br />You've got it right palette-wise. But also realize sprites aren't on a grid like the background. You can put them on any pixel. Edit: Ninja'd by lidnariq.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tasm6Mz.png" alt="Image" /><br />This shows boxes around where each sprite is. (That is thirteen 8x8 sprites.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure I understand all of your notes. You mention &quot;not sprite mode&quot;, but what's there couldn't be displayed using the background, nor could it be displayed without sprite overlays. The only meaningful difference between the tops and bottoms seems to be the number of palettes used.<br /><br />The top left isn't six sprites as you have it laid out. <br /><br />The top 16x16 area would use four sprites of the palette marked green. This would leave a white area that needs another sprite.<br />The legs would be two more sprites using the palette marked red. <br />An additional sprite is needed to display the white in the top using the palette marked yellow. That's seven.<br /><br />The bottom left wouldn't be six sprites + four sprites. It's be six + three. There's no need to draw or store a sprite that is fully transparent, so it's just the the three sprites as palette 2, and six as palette 1. <br /><br />But you could optimize it further, I'd bet. Can you post it non-scaled?<br /><br />For the top right, it wouldn't take eight sprites, it'd take 5. Two of the green marked palette for the top of the body, one of the yellow palette for the white area, two of the red palette for the feet.<br /><br />For the bottom right, it'd take either 6 or 7. (Hard to tell when the image is scaled.) If you post it unscaled I'll break it down in a few different ways. I think you're still thinking too deeply as this being a grid.<br /><br />Like, from what I can tell, the legs seem to only be eight pixels across, so they only need one sprite.<br />Edit: Well, nevermind on that last point. The one row of pixels at the bottom of the hands forces the leg area to be too wide for one sprite.

This is good because it reduces horizontal tile count, reducing the chance for sprite flickering.<br />- Only the sword is positioned on top of the other sprites<br /><br />You could use 2 palettes instead of 3 if you made the shoes black and then used white instead of brown on the second palette, like so:<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kR5xEjx.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This optimization balance is the key to good, varied NES graphics.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hi, sorry for my late reply.<br /><br />OK, dam, i thought i had it figured out, you all must must think i'm an idiot. that's cool, me wife does as well. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Let me just explain what i am trying to do as i think i haven't explained myself properly. I am not creating a game, nor am i developing a game with a NES system.(i may one day, but not yet). I am trying to learn how to create genuine NES looking game assets. Assets that keep to the limitations of the systems capabilities and colour palettes. In order for me to do this i am creating them using the tools such as NESST and YY-CHR. but sometimes i have a few questions which the software im using doesn't have the answer. I understand the background, but 'metasprites' are a bit of a riddle. I understand the colour rules to some degree and i want to get them right as much as i can, or a least have it where i can be confident that it can be done. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The image i showed previously has been scaled, and it wasn't created in any NES software. it was a sprite sheet that was made for another game engine in mind, but using the NES colour pallete in a way that it could be seen as a genuine looking NES game asset, because it had been created as if it was being created for a NES system. Which is something i am doing as well. The assets will of coarse be available in a chr file, or bitmap file, so they could be used for guys like yourself who still develop for the NES system, they may not be your cup of tea, but hey they might help someone here oneday. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Which is why i ask the horrible questions, <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> so i apoligise if some of you feel you may of wasted your time, but i can assure you, your advice is well received.<br /><br />I am a little confused now though? so a sprite is not an 8x8 tile then? i'm sure i read it was, im writing this and i can't qoute now who said what, haha. i feel i have followed what has been posted. Some of you are alarmed by my grid in the image, i suppose you need to ignore that as its not a NES thing. i just wanted to show you how i get the 8x8 sprite tile, use the colours and how id set it up, its not perfect i know, but colour wise is it not doable?<br /><br />i cant send the original unscaled version of my image i posted just yet as its on another computer, i can do it tommorow if you would still like to assist?<br /><br />thanks everyone<br /><br />thank for your responses. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
