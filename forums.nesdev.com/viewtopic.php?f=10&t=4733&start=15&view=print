You should probably have one "sub game state" by possible row, which sounds terribly tedious.<br /><br />Even more complex Konami games like Castlevania III, Lagrange Point, Bucky o'Hare, and so on are all coded that way. I really have no idea how Konami programmers were able to do it that way, but maybe it's just not as a headache as I can remember, if you use a lot of indirect jumps cleverly.</div>
<br />Are you saying that if you have a game state setup, you can't wait for vblank?  It sounds like you mean that if you don't wait for vblank the game will continue to draw all the rows as fast as it can and you'll see the whole text box rather than watching it get drawn, which may be true, but why can't you wait for vblank and also have a game state system?
<br />
<br />I would do something like this:
<br />
<br />mainloop:
<br />     jump to subroutine based on game state
<br />     jump to another subroutine the same way if you need to, etc.
<br />     ...
<br />     loopdone = 1 (tell NMI that we are done with main loop calculations)
<br />     wait for vblank
<br />     loopdone = 0
<br />     jmp mainloop
<br />
<br />You program NMI to do very little (sound processing only) until it hears from the main loop that its calculations are done, which may be one frame, two frames or less than a frame.  Either way, the main loop executes exactly once and then waits.
<br />
<br />As for doing a text box, you would deal with that within one of the game states, probably the main gameplay one like Final Fantasy's town map.   Early on you detect if a textbox is being drawn, and if it is you skip all of the movement processing and such and draw one line of the text box, ending the subroutine.  Every vblank a little more will get done until it's finished.

<br />
<br />My opinion on that is that if the input must be handled differently in different program sections, everything else probably will be different too, so these sections are basically different sets of main loops.
<br />
<br />I handle those in my programs as "program modules". They all set themselves up and eventually enter their main loops. Each of them is free to select which NMI routine to use and whatever else they'd like. Switching to a new module is just a matter of jumping to its reset address, and that's how the program jumps from module to module.

<br />
<br />My game engine is just a programm that flows normally, there is none of theese things, and it works very well and I don't feel limited. I admit I had to find a big trick for ennemies AI to trick the stack in order to make the programm much easier to write, and I'm still limited to 1 object = 1 metasprite, which I may get rid of if I feel like it without adding any crap to my game engine.
<br />
<br />If your title screen is different of your main gameplay (it should unless you're cloning SMB) just make it a different part of the programm and I don't see any problem. I don't understand what you want crappy thing you want to do with jsr in function of game state. However if that woks for you go ahead, I can't force anyone to use my programming technique.

It'd be AWESOME if there was a JSR ($xx), because I'd do away with JMP ($xx) all together. I only use it because I can jump to a variable address. You really don't have to use it. It's actually a good idea to have this somewhere in RAM:
<br />
<br />JSR $XXXX
<br />RTI
<br />
<br />For your NMI Routine. That way you can make $XXXX any address you want, since it's RAM, and still be doing a JSR. I think I might switch to this method instead of using indirect jumps. Oh, but make sure if you're outside of the NMI, and you are changing the address, first make the opcode for "JSR" "RTI" so that if the NMI is executed while you are updating the $XXXX part, it's not partially updated/interrupted, in which case it would crash.

<br />You can blame bunnyboy, since I jumped into writing my own game after finishing his tutorials.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  His pong game uses the gamestate method: <a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=8747" class="postlink">http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=8747</a>.  I'm a newbie so I don't really know if this gamestate method has any advantages over your own.
<br />
<br />One thing I want to make clear is that I haven't made any decision to use indirect jumps yet.  This was just a new idea that Celius introduced to me in this thread.  Right now my design documents show a gamestate setup using normal JSR.   There's just one jump at the beginning of the main loop to choose the right gamestate codeblock.
<br />
<br />Anyway I personally don't think gamestates are too complicated, but you bring up a good question: why bother?
<br />
<br />I haven't started coding at all yet as I'm just designing the game, so it would be very easy to change my mind and get away from the gamestate method of organizing it.  Thanks for bringing this up!
<br />
<br />Does anybody know of any advantages to using the gamestate method over a using series of loops like Bregalad?  If there aren't any, maybe I should change my design documents.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know if it is more or less effective to do so on the NES, but a state setup is just naturally how you do programming.  It's organized, efficient, and emphasizes code reusability.
<br />
<br />I see a stateless program as just one long stream of consciousness, where every new thing that happens is a result of what came before.  Ideally, you want every routine you have to be a self-contained function that takes a number of arguments and results in a predictable output.  It needs to be modular so that in the future you could drag and drop that one function into a new program and it would work the same way that it used to, as long as you gave it the same arguments.
<br />
<br />In the end I think it is mainly different structures, though.  What Bregalad describes sounds point to point, finish-this-then-move-on-to-that.  A game state setup is more like nested folders: you open the main folder, then decide which folder to open next, navigating an ordered list of functions that can you can change at any time based on variables.  You are in control, you don't have to move entire loops around if you want to change the order of things.  Just call a different subroutine.
<br />
<br />If everything is just a lot of loops in a straight line, what if you want to display the title screen again for some reason?  Yes you could jump to the title screen code, but after that the game starts over at level one automatically, right?  With a state you can change a variable and go right back into gameplay again.
<br />
<br />I'm not entirely sure I understand the setup Bregalad is talking about...it sounds a lot like there are states anyway, just without a single variable.
<br />
<br />What if you have some side scroller levels and some racing levels, with different drawing and input routines?  If you have anything in your game to detect which type of level it is and how the routines change, that's a game state.  Whenever the player pauses the game, that is a game state (everything is processed differently for the duration).  You're probably already following the basic principles without realizing it.  My way of organizing things is just taking it a little further than GameIsPaused = 1.
<br />
<br />Of course what is most important is that your game runs quickly and smoothly.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Working with gamestate method would be a huge mess because all code would be merged at the same place and doing lots of indirect jumps. This would be hard to modify and unorganized. Plus, the programm have to read a variable, do an indirect jump in function of it, read another, re-do an indirect jump, etc... It's unefficient when you could just jsr to the desired routine straight away. Code reusability ?

I'm a newbie so I don't really know if this gamestate method has any advantages over your own. </div><br />Well, I don't know what will work the best for you. I think the state method worked because a pong clone is extremely simple to code, and so the negative effect of the game state method didn't show up.<br /><br />I don't remember if I mentionned it yet, but I originally wanted to make a RPG on the NES based on a "Game State" variable, where 0 = Title Screen, 1 = Menu sub-screen, 2 = Field screen and 3 = Battle. In the NMI I just did an indirect jump (altough I only implemented 0 and 1 before giving up that programm).<br />It worked very well for 0, as nothing very spectacular had to be done. However, for 1, I had a long hard time to figure how to draw text-boxes with this engine. I made a "sub-game state" variable to get more entry points in my routines, but that was still too limited. In the end I ended up using an indirect jump pointer, and whenever a frame was complete, I set this pointer so that on next frame it would do an indirect jump to it. But even that was a headache to handle, so I gave up and made another project <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />That was long ago tough so I don't really remember the details. Maybe what I wrote above isn't exactly correct also. I think I thrown away the source so I can't even look back to see why that was such a pain. I was a newbie to programming back then, so how painfull this was could also be done to my lack of programming skills.<br /><br />However, more recently I found myself having headache with enemy AI because I had only one entry point, and needed to do lot of switch and if/else branches in function of enemy's state variable. I hated it because while it worked fine, each time I wanted to modify the code to add something to enemy's AI, it was a headache. Now I found a way to trick the stak in order to have a variable entry point, and everything fixes up  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br />There is sill the inconvenient that if I wanted to call a routine in all cases no matter the enemy's state, I had to do it only once before the indirect jump with the old system, and I have to do it a lot of times with the new. However, again a simple use of the jsr opcode can fix that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What if you have some side scroller levels and some racing levels, with different drawing and input routines? </div>
<br />Well, you'd probably have only one routine reading the controller, but a different engine reading it and interfacing with it.
<br />As for drawing routines, they don't really need to be different. I have a routine that allows me to draw up to 2 name table rows + 1 attribute table rows in NMI (or less if I need less), and another that allows me to draw a metatile without changing the rest. That does all the drawing for me and I never felt any limited with that (other than what the hardware limits you). If I were to do completely disconnected engine where more special screen updates would be needed, I guess I'd still opt for different NMI routines.

<br />
<br />A state system in the way I am talking about it is literally just determining what to do next based on a variable, involving a lot of subroutines.  The game starts out in a title screen state, and when the player moves past that the state changes to the game, etc.
<br />
<br />I think what we are talking about here is just the difference beteen an extended if-then statement and a select case.
<br />
<br />Like so:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">if titlescreen = 1 then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;jsr title<br />else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;jsr gameplay<br /><br />gameplay:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if statusscreen = 1 then<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jsr status<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jsr maingame</div><br /><br />vs.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">x = gamestate<br />jsr statetable,x<br /><br />statetable:<br />.db title, status, maingame</div>
<br />
<br />Is that about right?
