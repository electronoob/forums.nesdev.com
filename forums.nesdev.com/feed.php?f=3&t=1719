Now that the discussion about FFE has been split, I would like to add one more issue: I would like someone to investigate what <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/trans/764/" class="postlink">this translation's</a> documentation says about mapper 78.<br /><br />Specifically, the documentation says this (emphasis mine):<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />...Because all this compression was already in place, there was nothing left<br />for me to compress.  I had to expand the ROM with a mapper chip to fit in the<br />English text.  But, I only needed a really basic chip that simply doubles the<br />lower bank of program ROM as this is where all the 496 blocks of text are<br />stored.  I would simply swap it based on which of the pieces of text need to<br />be displayed at any moment.<br /><br />It turned out that Mapper 78, the Irem 74HC161/32 chip was perfect.  With it<br />you could have any number of program banks replace the first program bank, but<br />not change the second program bank--exactly what I needed.  You can switch<br />character banks with it too, but I didn't need that.  Supposedly, "several<br />Japanese Irem titles use this mapper", but I could only find two.<br /><br />* Uchuusen - Cosmo Carrier  by Jaleco<br />* Holy Diver                by irem<br /><br />And <strong><em>they switch banks quite differently, so in reality they are actually two<br />completely different mapper chips.  Holy Diver's mapper needed a special 256<br />byte table to work... yuck, I didn't have that kind of room to waste.  But<br />Uchuusen's mapper, you simply load the bank number you want into register A<br />and then perform this 4 byte piece of code.</em></strong>  Easy and efficient.<br /><br />tay            ;A8<br />sta $d548,y    ;99 48 D5<br /></div>Should mapper 78 be split? Or do the two games mentioned really use the same bankswitching method and different data patterns to handle bus conflicts (Holy Diver a table of all possible byte values, and Uchuusen - Cosmo Carrier something a little more clever)?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=499">-_pentium5.1_-</a> — Mon Jul 03, 2006 1:06 pm</p><hr />

iNES mappers are one big mess, shared conflicts and duplicates everywhere. It can't be said which ones are still free, because, not counting the numbers assigned by Marat himself, the list is not official.<br /><br />UNIF on the other hand... hmm, but that's like changing the world from QWERTY to Dvorak, it would help if Cowering would convert from GoodNES to GoodUNIF.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=115">hap</a> — Fri Jun 30, 2006 8:15 am</p><hr />
