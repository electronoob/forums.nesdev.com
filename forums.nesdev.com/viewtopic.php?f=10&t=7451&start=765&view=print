So in the above code snippet I would set the player's X velocity value to some value. Then during the object update routine I apply the velocity to the position, then check for collisions, and if there is a collision react to it. If you do go this route, do Y movement and collision detection first, then X. Trust me on that one <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />If you want to take the immediate route I would recommend JSR'ing to a routine that calculates what the X value would be, then sees if that movement is possible. Depending on your level data layout this routine might be pretty complex, and I personally wouldn't want it cluttering up my input routine.<br /><br />Also, sounds like you've got good parents and a pretty awesome sister <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

Instead, it should affect the horizontal velocity (just like gravity affects its vertical velocity), and the velocity, whatever it is, should be added to the player's position every frame (again, like happens with vertical movement).<br /><br />If a direction is pressed, increase velocity in that direction, if no direction is pressed, gradually decrease the velocity until it reaches 0 (this creates a nice inertia effect). After adding the velocity variable to the current position, check whether the block(s) at the edge of the player in the direction of the movement are solid, in which case you need to push the character back, like we discussed before.<br /><br />Ejecting from the right should be exactly same as repelling from the ground, while the formula for ejecting from the left or from the ceiling is a bit different, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.
