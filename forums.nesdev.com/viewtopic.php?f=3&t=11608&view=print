		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know how you say something is 97% accurate. That really doesn't make sense to give it a number. How was this number calculated, or was it just pulled from nowhere? <br /><br />We have extremely detailed information about how the NES behaves these days. If you very carefully followed every little detail you'd have an extremely accurate emulator. Most NES emulators are far better than what was available over a decade ago just because of the wealth of information we have gained. <br /><br />Another point to be made though, why does it matter to you which is the most accurate? Are you developing new software? If you are, I can definitely see wanting to find the most accurate emulator with good debugging features. If not that, maybe I could see you wanting the best compatibility. But even with just a basic level of accuracy you can probably support 90% of licensed games. The more precise accuracy tends to be for a very small percentage of games to work properly. Games you may never play anyway. So if you are just playing games, you're better off looking for the emulator that has the features you like best and works best on your hardware.

That's why I wanted one with accuracy. Counting that no FDS emulators are accurate, an NES one (with FDS support) with close accuracy would be enough.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Which is the Most Accurate NES Emulator?<br />Not an easy question to answer. All the latest emulators tend to be very accurate, but I can highlight a few:<br />-- Nestopia<br />Can run almost any game. However it is not the best emulator in terms of accuracy. It has problems with IRQ processing, audio processing, DMA, video processing, PPU/CPU sync.<br />-- Nintendulator<br />Was really a revelation for me. It is written in C++ and the source code is really straight-forward, almost like asm. From that I could really see that the author understands very well how NES operates internally (it matches my vision in most details at least). However, it has a lot of inaccuracies too (IRQ processing, unofficial opcodes, audio processing, DMA, PPU/CPU sync). But it has a very good PPU, I must give a credit for that.<br />-- puNES<br />Has a closed source code, thats too bad. But it is the most accurate emulator I know, especially when it comes to APU. There is still work left to improve PPU and maybe to implement some missing details for the variants of NES (NES PAL, NES NTSC, FC, Dendy, other clones).<br />-- FCEUX<br />Does not have a good accuracy, but is very useful for debugging and stuff.<br /><br />I did not research this closely, but it can give you some ideas.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Like I always say, running a large number of games is not a sign of accuracy. Commercial games (and newer homebrew games) are finished programs, which have been tested and bug fixed for release. This means that they are (usually) well behaved programs, that do most of their work according to the book, so a higher level simulation of the system is often enough to support them well. Things are very different during the development of a new game: you'll find yourself writing to wrong memory locations, extrapolating VBlank time, forgetting to initialize registers... and that's when accuracy is really needed, otherwise those problems might go undetected if the emulator is too forgiving with the little details.
