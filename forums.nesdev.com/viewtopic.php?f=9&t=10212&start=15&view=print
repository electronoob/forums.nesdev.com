So you might as well invest in the n8.</div><br /><br />Bullshit, terrible advice. N8 is a better built PP. PP2 will probably kick it's ass for having bigger ROM space alone, as N8 is piss poor at only 512KB each side. I'd wait, for sure. Don't get anything until the PP2 is out. Much better over all, considering we'll have at minimum a scoreboard and the same stuff PP already has, which is better than the N8 by a long shot.

No warning. <br /><br />All the flash carts are likely to play the main mappers fine. It's obscure mappers and special features that make them better or worse. One thing that is cool that I don't know if the N8 supports, is the realtime save states. There are realtime save state mappers for PowerPAK.

I know the Mega EverDrive supports save states, but I don't believe any of the other ones support such a feature. To be clear though, I really like the EverDrive cartridges. But I also like the PowerPAKs. I have a feeling much of the slamming of the PowerPAK's reputation is actually related to issues with bunnyboy/retrozone, grudges or other type of drama. Or maybe fanboyism toward the EverDrive line. <br /><br />As a product, the PowerPAK is a fine one. But I've noticed people don't compare products as products, they judge them on things that have nothing to do with how the product works.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The color restrictions on the NES make it hard to make the UI look good, although there's some obvious improvements over the default PowerPak firmware.<br />The most important thing is paying attention to the 90% safe area, which AIUI the current firmware doesn't.<br /><br />There's a bit the FPGA can do to help (like automagic <s>non</s>proportional font support) but you're still kinda hamstrung by the very small source palette, the even smaller active palette, and the 256px width of the screen.<br />The FPGA can also shrink the attribute area from 16×16 to 8×1, which would only help with putting shorter-than-8-pixel text on the screen, because each row of text could draw from a different attribute.<br />Finding a good antialiased font at any smaller size might be difficult, however. (For non-antialised fonts, I suppose the Chicago typeface, or one of the 4x6 tiny fonts, maybe.)
