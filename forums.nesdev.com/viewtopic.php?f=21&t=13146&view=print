When your looking directly at the tiles themselves, you can see a lot of attribute clash problems.  Colors themselves look a little dull on emulators too.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure, but I think the later DKC games did a little better with color palette choices.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The most serious problem I see with DKC is that the anti-aliasing of the graphics doesn't go well with the hard transparency (no alpha). All edges end up looking very jaggy. Another issue I see is that some parts have very busy textures, that look like a mess of pixels when seen on anything other than a blurry CRT TV.<br /><br />Other than that, I think the style is pretty consistent, and it works even though the hardware isn't the best to reproduce pre-rendered 3D graphics. Unfortunately, the Genesis is even less suited for that, and I don't even have to say anything about the NES.<br /><br />On the Genesis, I think that the standard techniques would work fine: increase the contrast a bit, so the result doesn't look washed out, and reduce color usage with dithering. Make use of the higher horizontal resolution to make the dithering blend more, which means adjusting the graphics to a new aspect ratio.<br /><br />On the NES you'd need a different approach if you expect it to not look like crap. The pre-rendered look won't work, the graphics have to be cartoonized a bit. Objects should still have volume (i.e. shadows and highlights whenever possible). Backgrounds could be more heavily dithered. A more washed out look will be unavoidable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the sprites need some help. I'd have probably sacrificed some of the sprite per scanline limit for more colorful sprites. Also, kind of random, but many of the backgrounds are oddly colored. Why is the factory background red? It really doesn't seem like all 16 color palettes for BGs or sprites are ever being used and there are some attribute problems, but that's to be expected with 2bpp graphics. (Certainty not all palettes are used for sprites, because on the SNES with 8 palettes, no more than 8 different types of objects are even onscreen, unless they do use the same color palette. They probably could have reserved 2 palettes per object instead of just 1.) Like I said though, flickering can be pretty bad, but only ever really around large amounts of bananas, which reasonable only need one palette anyway.

The backgrounds are surprisingly good, but the sprites are, um... let's just say they leave a lot to be desired, and some palette choices are really questionable. No idea if this longplay is using color correction though (the LCD screen washed out the colors a lot so palettes were made to counter it - also this causes issues on the GBA that doesn't do this heavy washing making GBC games look darker than they should)

To oversimplify things: GBC's gamma is kind of light, GBA's gamma is very dark, DS's gamma is less dark, DS Lite's gamma matches Game Boy Player and is very close to Super NES 5-bit.

Oil Drum alley also has a dark red background instead of the dark gray, and I'm sure many of the caves are also off.
