Send an erase command while you're editing an assembly language file, and then by the time you've finished editing, compiling, and linking the program, the flash should be ready to program the next build.<br /><br />That and use segments to put the part of the program you're working on in $8000-$9FFF and the part that isn't currently changing in $A000-$FFFF. Depending on the size of your memory's erase blocks, that might save you some programming time.

When you go back to the assembler, initiate an erase and then it's ready to program for the next testing round.

We had 256K parts on a project I worked on and it was *very* convenient.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i have plenty of different types of memory, and I do plan to experiment with them to find the best options.  I have tons of eproms, but the goal of my cartridge is quick programming times.  So i'll save the eproms (and proms for that matter) for when projects are more complete.<br />The arduino is a very good tool for programming the roms.  I am working on a small python program that acts as the computer side interface for the programmer.  I will first do a command line driven program, but in the future I will do a gui with things like show difference, verify (the command line version will have this), and other features of the sort.  Additionally, the eeproms I am using have 64 bytes for chip identification.  I can utilize this to keep track of what chips are being used for what projects, so when they are inserted in the programmer, it will automatically know what the chip is for.

Wouldn't RAM be a better option?</div><br />You're looking at minimum 100,000 write cycle limit typically.<br /><br />Let's say you develop games as your day job, and flash builds 20 times an hour. 160 flashes a day.  5 days a week, for 800 writes a week.   50 weeks a year for 40K writes a year.  Gives you at least 2 1/2 years on flash.  So it is possible with heavy abuse.<br /><br />FRAM is nice, but very limited in size for parallel 5v readily available options.  Digikey doesn't even stock such a thing.  If you buy in qtys &gt;200 you can pay a hefty $7/chip for a whopping 8KBytes, 32KBytes will cost you TWICE that @ $14.  There are other options for suppliers of course, but if places like digikey don't have it readily available it's a pretty rare device.  For that price you could socket a 128KB flash and include 15 spare chips to last 40+ years...  Pretty sure your pins would wear off the cartridge with that kind of abuse.<br /><br />~$3 or less for battery backed sram beats em all if you're looking for speed, durability, replace-ability, and non-volatility assuming you will reach EOL of flash.  You don't even need a battery for a devcart though...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Most people savvy enough to program for the NES already have muddled through cobbling together their own solutions - and they like it that way, methinks.<br /><br />The people that need and want a development kit are the same that are thriving in the Atari 2600 community.  They  thrive because they have these items available:<br /><br />* A fully integrated IDE that manages projects, code, art assets within (VisualbB)<br />* A novice understandable programming language tied into that IDE (batari BASIC)<br />* An emulator that reports back when you've gone over cycle. (Stella)<br />* Flash cart that makes testing easy with FAT32 formatted SD card support. (Harmony Cart)<br />* A storefront to make actual carts with labels (AtariAge)<br /><br />I think some of these things are starting to happen for the NES community.  I think the flash cart portion is the most mature with the PowerPak and EverDrive NES still readily available.<br /><br />Maybe a better goal is to find pre-existing projects and help them grow/work with eachother to reach the five points above that the 2600 guys enjoy.
