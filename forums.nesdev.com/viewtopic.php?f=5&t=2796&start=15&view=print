<br />The SMS has a single "pause" (as opposed to start) button on the console itself. The controllers only have the directional pad and buttons 1 and 2. From a programming point of view, the pause button isn't even a button like all others, it actually triggers an NMI.

<br />OK, I might have seen that on the SMS, but just doesn't ring a bell for the Genesis. I have also seen that on my MSX machines, and the SMS video chip is a direct evolution to the MSX VDP. And as I've heard, the Genesis VDP is an evolution of the SMS VDP (although it lacks the screen modes that were avaliable on the MSX, I think). That may be the reason this problem you talked about lived for so long.

<br />But at least on the Genesis, you have exactly 2 pixels per color cycle, which makes the issue easier to pixel around.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But at least on the Genesis, you have exactly 2 pixels per color cycle, which makes the issue easier to pixel around.</div>
<br />I calculated 1.875 pixels per color clock (6.7116375 MHz pixel rate, derived from 53.6931 MHz master clock), and the artifact pattern matches this. It's a bit more than the SMS (1.5 pixels per color clock, like the NES), but still gives nasty artifacts.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ooh, here's a nice and interesting topic.  Some various comments:
<br />
<br />The NES has more shades of grey than the SMS.  (Bonus!)
<br />
<br />The SMS cannot change vertical scrolling mid-frame, as the NES can (with some effort), so some types of raster effects are impossible.  Horizontal scroll raster effects are possible, though the method of setting up raster interrupts is pretty stupid.  You can't set an interrupt to an arbitrary scanline (as on the SNES or PC-E), but rather set up an interrupt N scanlines after the previous interrupt.  It's a bit convoluted.
<br />
<br />Yeah, most SMS programmers who have commented on sprites have said that whoever decided that sprites could not be flipped should be flogged with a large wet fish, or something similar.
<br />
<br />Sprite scaling on the SMS is useful sometimes... like at the bottom of the screen if you want a large status bar made of sprites.  This is what Earthworm Jim on the GG/SMS does.  You can keep sprites normal-sized until you get near the bottom of the screen, then turn scaling on.
<br />
<br />Since the SMS uses VRAM, storing all the frames of a character's animation in VRAM at the same time is a waste of the system's memory.  That's probably why many games have 4 or 8 tiles in VRAM that the Vblank code writes CHR data into to animate the main character, and -- yes -- flip his/her sprite data.
<br />
<br />The lack of buttons on the controller and strange palette/sprite limitations are probably a result of being chained to the legacy TMSxxxx modes of the SMS' predecessor, the SG-1000.
<br />
<br />The Z80 is a bit weird, but it has some nice and useful instructions that the 6502 doesn't, but apparently the Z80 is 4 times slower as a result.  That's why Z80 programmers don't count clock cycles, but T-states, or something like that.
<br />
<br />Finally, regarding the colourburst issue of NES vs. SMS, what Blargg wrote is true: the NTSC SMS has a terrible video encoder.  Here, I'm working on a page that compares systems' RGB output to their composite outputs: <a href="http://www.disgruntleddesigner.com/chrisc/gotRGB/screenshots.html" class="postlink">http://www.disgruntleddesigner.com/chrisc/gotRGB/screenshots.html</a>

A better way to compare video quality would be to take video snapshots with a good video digitizer accepting composite and RGB (or at least S-Video). Pointing a camera at a TV adds too much distortion (brightness, Moire effects, blurryness) and variation between different photos. You'd also need to merge even and odd fields to get a representative image, otherwise you're making the artifacts more prominent than they appear on a TV.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems like the NES CPU would be a little faster (lots of people compare a 4Mhz Z80 to a 1Mhz 6502), but the architectures are radically different and I don't know Z80 asm so it's hard to tell.  It's probably pretty close, with each CPU being close to stomping the other at certain tasks (assuming a fully competent programmer on both sides, regarding that though I think the 6502 looks easier to learn and use fully since it's mostly about optimal use of addressing modes).
<br />
<br />NES definitely has better sound.  It can produce all kinds of textures, especially when you get the DPCM channel involved.  SMS does have the advantage of having 3 melodic channels with volume control, but that's kinda overshadowed to me when the NES can go a whole 2 octaves lower for bass.
<br />
<br />Being able to flip BG tiles seems kinda nice (SNES can do that), if not terrible useful, but there's no way I'd take that over being able to flip sprite tiles.. that's just pure crazyness.
<br />
<br />Having the extra buttons on the NES controller sure is good too.  Pause button on the console is kinda brain-dead, but a lot better than nothing I guess.  Atari systems were kinda similar, but had more buttons and switches on the console than on the controller itself, heheh.  Much to my confusion, you had to use those to play a few games too.
<br />
<br />Having all those colors for tiles is pretty nice, but I bet that gets a little burdensome when it comes to having to redraw the sprites to flip them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After writing Z80 asm for a couple of years, i'll add some of my characteristically useless comments to the matter:
<br />
<br />+ 6502 has much more powerful methods of addressing memory
<br />+ Z80 has a much more orthogonal instruction set
<br />+ Z80 allows you to treat 8-bit register pairs, like B and C, as 16-bit units (BC), which is very cool
<br />+ Z80 has some very cool auto-increment modifiers: ld A,[HLI] loads a byte from memory and increments the 16-bit pointer in the HL pair
<br />- 6502 is missing lots of useful instructions, like INA/DEA, and passing everything through the accumulator is a pain in the ass.
<br />- 6502 has 1 general purpose register. implementing any algorithm that accesses several variables ends up requiring more code compared to z80
<br />- Z80 probably runs slower, and probably costs more to make, due to the increased complexity of the opcode set
<br />
<br />I only used the GB/GBC castrated version of the Z80 (which is actually more like an Intel 8080), which is missing quite a bit of Z80 functionality, and i admittedly have done about 100 times more GBC programming than NES programming, but i would have to say i enjoyed the z80 more. Though when i moved to the ARM7, which clearly modeled its THUMB instruction set after the 6502, it was nice to have had experience working with the NES CPU.
<br />
<br />Edit: INX/INY-&gt;INA/DEA

<br />Umm, that's probably a really bad example since the 6502 <strong>does</strong> have instructions INX and INY (as well as DEX and DEY) - perhaps you were thinking of some other operation?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the 65C02 can be had new from WDC for $5. Zilog doesn't seem to put prices on their site, but I believe the Z80 in a vanilla-processor version goes for ~$7.
<br />
<br />Also, yes, the 6502 does have INY and INX (and DEY and DEX.) Amusingly, it doesn't have INC A or DEC A (though I believe the C02 adds this.)
<br />
<br />I admit, though, that it's nicer to have more general-purpose registers as the Z80 does, and the 16-bit operations are a nice bonus as well. However, the 6502 has a clear edge on the Z80 in terms of execution times. Memblers is probably right, it probably depends on what's being done and who's doing it, but my preference leans towards 6502.

<br />
<br />I don't think the 6502 lacks anything actually. I've never tried Z80, but with all processors I've coded for, the 6502 has by far the best instruciton set. Many processor just have direct and indirect modes. Indexed, and indirect-indexed mode are pure genius, and you cannot see at wich points they makes the programmers live easier until you code for another processor.
<br />
<br />Also X and Y can serve as general purpose registers, tough you cannot do any arithmetic on them exept increment and decrement (thanks god to read/write arrays), and you cannot for example directly add them with A wich would make the 6502 instruction set even more perfect than what it is.
