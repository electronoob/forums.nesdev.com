<br />
<br />Genecyst really brought home the emulation concept for me--that you're truly playing the literal game. This is kind of funny, but I did a double take because I had remembered Genesis games having a lot more fine detail when I last played one a few years prior (probably RF interference), the clarity of a RGB monitor in whatever screenmode Genecyst used was too "blocky".

I had the chance of calling him in Moscow back in 1997 -- all I wanted to say to him was "thank you" (in English and Russian) and he couldn't respond since he can't speak English (but can type it fine).  It never occurred to me until then that someone could type a language but not speak it.  He's also the main reason I learned a little Russian and gained some interest in Russian culture over the years.  He and I have a running joke (dating back to something like 1995) about barracudas...  ;D
<br />
<br />I've pointed him to this thread and I'm absolutely certain it will make him smile and bring a tear to his eye; he's a nostalgic.  :-)
<br />
<br />If you have any questions for him about LandyNES, etc. let me know and I can ask him, otherwise we might get Shiru to convert the questions from English into Russian so Landy can understand them better.  But that said, I'd like to politely request you not ask questions about the LandyNES/iNES ordeal or Alex/Marat friendship -- it's not something he likes talking about for a lot of reasons.

<br />
<br />I can write in English, around 90%. Since I don't practice chatting with another guy in English, well, I can speak at ~60% and listen ~40%. I just need more practice.

<br />The same kind of double take you might do when playing an NES through an LCD TV?

<br />Same here.
<br />
<br />The fact English vowels are completely distorted, and that you don't know how to speak a word even if you write it in this particular language doesn't help.
<br />The good side of english language is the simple grammar and conjugation, and similarity in vocabulary with french.

<br />Heh, I distinctly remember my father thinking the same thing. We used to play Genesis together all the time, and in 1997, when he first got internet, I found out about emulators and promptly downloaded Genecyst and Sonic 1. Knowing that he was a Sonic fan and that he would enjoy playing it on his computer, I showed it to him, and the first thing he did has ask me if the resolution wasn't higher on the actual console.
