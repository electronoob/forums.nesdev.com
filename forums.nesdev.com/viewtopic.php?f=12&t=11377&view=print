		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey there, I figured out that there's an easier route to program some SNES games rather than using 27C322 and doing all that nightmare rewiring. But as the title suggests, I have a Willem version PCB50B and I don't know if it's able to program these flash EPROMs like 29F016 or the mentioned 29F032. Also you need some kind of TSOP40=&gt;DIP36 adapter that are available here and some more advanced soldering skills. Link to PCBs: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.buyicnow.com/it.php?i=396">http://www.buyicnow.com/it.php?i=396</a><!-- m --><br /><br />So here go my questions:<br /><br />1.Which board is the best one?? What are the differences between them??<br /><br />2.Will a flash EPROM work 100% good on SNES cartridge board?? I mean I experienced some issues with some flash EPROMs on NES dev-carts that shouldn't exist and probably that was due to wrong connected special pins (CE, OE, WE etc.). So is there everything connected as it should be?? Are there any technical advantages or disadvantages over using an actual UV EPROM??<br /><br />And the major and most important one:<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">3.Is my programmer (Willem PCB50B) even capable of programming such chips???</span></strong> Is there any adapter available for it allowing me to program them?? I tried to search google but I only get some garbage or something completely unrelated to my problem... I'm afraid I need to buy a different programmer, maybe GQ-4X. Well it's still not a big deal since I can buy a newer one and sell mine but I'd really rather be using my current one I already have<br /><br />Any ideas?? I'd once again be very grateful for any answers and advices!! Big thanks in advance!!

Yes, they work.<br /><br />-Advantages or disadvantages over using an actual UV EPROM?? - You don't need an UV eraser, also doesn't need any rewiring (like swapbin), just plugs straight in place of the original maskrom (I mean adapter III)<br /><br />-I don't know anything about Your programmer, it probably can program these chips. Do some research, check the manufacturer's website, look around the web, maybe someone had the same question?

But, would you provide me some more details for it?? Do I need to make that PCB by myself?? What method would be the best?? Or is there any company that makes PCBs by looking at the project?? Anyway, how can I open it??

When you published your response, not only you gave me some very useful information but I have even already bought the PCBs!! I'm just stunned how simple that site is!!<br /><br />Well first of all I wanted to try some local (in my situation it's Poland) companys that produce PCBs but there was tons of variations and options but the worst part of it is that they rip off ridiculously sky high and some of them have very bad opinions.... and here I bought 3 of them for just 9$ and everybody's opinion about that site is very good as I've seen. So ordering them from the US is MUCH more affordable than giving a chance some company in Poland, so that's just absurd...<br /><br />Once again, thanks so much for your big help, I'll let you know if everything goes right!!<br /><br />Oh and by the way I forgot to ask- does speed of 29F032 matter?? What is the best option?? I want to buy exactly AM29F032 but I don't know which model will be the most useful
