		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hi guys. i know i made a thread about my open-source PC emulator Fake86 (written in C) in the past, but i have compiled what i might release as the newest version. i was hoping i could find a few people who would like to give it a test run. i'd love to get feedback, and maybe somebody will run into a huge bug i haven't seen yet or something.
<br />
<br />most of the improvements in this version are SPEED (by a lot), audio quality, and i fixed several CPU emulation bugs... hopefully without introducing others.
<br />
<br />i know this is a NES dev forum, but most of you are interested in emulation in general and lots of you are good coders as well so i thought it would be a good place to go for this.
<br />
<br />here's a ZIP with the new win32 binary, support files, and a 15 MB test hard drive image with DOS 6.22, shareware Wolf3D, and also Ultima 6 to get you started.
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://rubbermallet.org/fake86-0.11.10.21-test.zip">http://rubbermallet.org/fake86-0.11.10.21-test.zip</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />it also comes with a blank drive image generator to make your own to install an OS to from floppy images.
<br />
<br />it has to be run from the command line, just run fake86.exe without any parameters to see the list of valid ones. this will boot to the test drive image:
<br />
<br />fake86.exe -hd0 test.raw
<br />
<br />
<br />if you're not familiar with it, it emulates an 8086/80186 PC so it's real-mode only. it can emulate hercules, CGA, and VGA/MCGA graphics (but no EGA or 640x480 VGA yet) - it also emulates a disney sound source adapter, and an adlib music synth card.
<br />
<br />if you need to change floppy disk images on the fly, ctrl-alt-M switches your view to the fake86 monitor where you can enter commands. for example, this would change the image file used for floppy 0:
<br />
<br />fd0=c:\path\to\image.img
<br />
<br />typing exit leaves the monitor. i big-time appreciate anybody who helps and checks it out. let me know if you have any questions. fyi, i've started re-writing the whole CPU core to support 386 and protected mode, but it will be a while before that's ready.
