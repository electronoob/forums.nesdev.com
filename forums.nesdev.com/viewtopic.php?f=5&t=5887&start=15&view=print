I suppose there's no way to disable the PPU (video for you) and inputs ("Joystick" for you), unless by writing a few lines of asm code. I added NSF playback in my emulator and could detect a few ones within writes to PPU, which should have been removed. In other words, it's <strong>not</strong> exactly like you said.</div>
<br />I meant in the context of a standalone player, i.e. a seperate program, or a plugin for another music-playing program like winamp, or foobar. All you need is the CPU emulator, and the sound core. Emulation code that emulates the PPU and renders it, and code that processes PC input and translates them to joystick input can both be omitted from the music player.
<br />
<br />If an NSF file writes to the PPU at all, it's not a clean rip.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />cool news! i've been checking out the sets this morning with the new GEP update. I have to say though, one niggling criticism i have is that for the average person this format doesn't provide any significant advantages versus KSS/VGM. one of the nice things about VGM (and other emulated formats) is per-track tagging and timing, which might seem like fluff but is incredibly practical. i assume for this format tagging would mean either custom m3u lists, alike NSF GBS KSS etc. (even then, there's no per-track composer/artist accreditation, which would be useful for Last FM fagz) or maybe some sort of proprietary format like NSFE. so i'll probably stick to VGM for the time being (where applicable), as it seems more practical if you <em>just</em> want to listen to the music, which I assume is all most people would be likely to do. if it weren't for this, it'd be superduperawesome.
<br />
<br />another thing i'm curious about - what are the differences between this format and sms/gg KSS files, either technically or practically? i assume KSS can't be played on hardware? or are there other important differences too?
<br />
<br />anyway, this is a positive thing! no intention to crash the party, etc. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Oh, and since Virtual Boy and Neo Geo Pocket are the last two handhelds that don't have a music format for them... Anyone thinking about those two? Both had some spiffy chiptunes made for them.</div>
<br />
<br />mm. even though the VB only has a dozen or so games, i still think it'd be pretty cool. i don't know of any repository with all the soundtracks properly recorded, tagged, encoded or even <em>available</em> at all. that and channel muting is nice to have. it could also open doors for chip musicians creating music in that format, be it with MML or a dedicated tracker. VSF? i'd certainly like to see it in future. there are a lot of benefits to having emulated formats.

<br />No low octave and one duty cycle will do that. Compare Mortal Kombat for Game Gear to Mortal Kombat for Game Boy. (If you set the appropriate SGB palette, the blood's even red.)

<br />Yeah! I always wondered why GG/SMS games had their music so high pitched. Wonderboy even has the FM music play an octave lower. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />The only soundtrack for the VB that I know about and would be interested in is Teleroboxer. If available, I'd probably grab a few more sets though, if only to 'explore' VB music more. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />I have a n00b question tho
<br />
<br />where do I put the dll?  I tried the plugins folder, and the main wimamp folder, and it didn't work when the dll was in either of them
