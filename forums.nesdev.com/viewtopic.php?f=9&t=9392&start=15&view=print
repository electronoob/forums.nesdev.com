		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />just a follow up: my fault, I had some wires at the wrong points. fixing them improved things, but it's still not right. I can start a new game, and pull up the default list of best times for glass joe (which I think means the ram is at least enabled correctly), but the game hangs after the fight same as if ram is not present. So I'm not sure what's happening there. I'm putting it aside for now. The other one I built at the same time is working fine, so I guess I'll just finish that one.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />goddammit.<br /><br />So I finished up the build on the other board and everything seemed fine. ram was working while the game was running, and it even appeared to persist through powering off and sitting for a few minutes. But it appears not to be stable, as I went back and checked after another 30 mins and the save data was cleared.<br /><br />So, what now? Notes:<br /><br />I built the battery circuit based on instructions for <a href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=81242" class="postlink">FFIII as listed here</a>. I had built a FFIII cart previously and I believe the savegame held fine while the game sat unplayed for several months.<br /><br />The battery is new and is putting out ~3.3V, although the ram Vcc pin is measuring 2.98V. Is that good enough? The battery is connected to the capacitor, and the cap is connected to ram. Should the battery go to ram first, then the cap?<br /><br />I held reset while powering off, as you are supposed to do with other battery games.<br /><br />I connected M2 to the 7420 and ram CE2 to 5V.<br /><br />pics:<br /><a href="http://segacd.org/up/mtpopc10/CAM00026.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://segacd.org/up/mtpopc10/t/CAM00026.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> <a href="http://segacd.org/up/mtpopc10/CAM00027.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://segacd.org/up/mtpopc10/t/CAM00027.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perhaps they're there, but with the low resolution I can't see them,  where are the diodes???<br /><br />That thread says to use standard 1n4148 switching diodes which isnt a great idea.  I've<br /> Had issues with them in the past.  Schottky diodes are more appropriate and designed for applications such as this.  Wouldn't surprise me if they were a source of trouble.  Do you have a pull up resistor on the /CE line and CE tied too sram's Vcc?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Diodes are on the backside of the perf board - they kind of blend in but the blue bands make them easier to see. You can click on the photos to see the jumbo versions. For the battery half, it's <br /><br />battery + &gt; resistor &gt; diode &gt; cap + &gt; ram Vcc<br /><br />pretty sure I have the diode pointing the right way.<br /><br />I pulled the diodes, resistor, and cap off and Al Unser cart, figuring they would be appropriate to use here. Is that wrong? <br /><br />The only resistor I've added is the one off the battery. ram /CE is wired right to the 7420 output line. ram CE is right to 5V at CHR pin 30. Do I need some resistors in there somewhere in the? What would be the purpose of that? I can follow directions, but the electronic engineering aspect of this is still over my head.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I see the diodes now, my phone was only giving me poor res photos for some reason...<br /><br />Yeah you're not handling the CE and /CE lines properly.  You're supplying power while the cart isn't running, but your not deactivating the SRAM (aka putting it in standby/sleep mode) so it loses data eventhough it has power.<br /><br />CE pin should be connected directly to SRAM's VCC  This will keep it high at all times.  Take a look at your datasheet, this should be okay.<br /><br />/CE pin is connected to your logic which drives it when it's running.  But when you've lost power you need this pin to go high to 'put the sram in low power standby'  To do this add a pull up resistor between the /CE pin and SRAM Vcc pin.

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />You can fiddle with the exact ratio of 5.6k to 1k resistors to trade off the best point of &quot;shuts down permission to write to the RAM before any dirty writes from the CPU&quot; and &quot;doesn't randomly disable itself in response to instability on the +5V line&quot;. The simulation shows a corner at 6.8k-&gt;4.8V, 6.2k-&gt;4.4V, 5.6k-&gt;4.0V, 5.1k-&gt;3.7V, but real-world behavior probably won't align.<br /><br />Note that the battery voltage is no-where in this circuit.<br /><br />For the PNP transistor use almost anything: a 2N3906, 2N4403, BC557, &amp;c. <span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">edit: braino'd, listed an NPN instead of a PNP part #</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That is a handy little schematic, thanks for sharing.  One potential issue I that could be taken into account if trying to make it more universal.  Clones don't operate at 5v, they're usually around 3.5v from what I've heard.  I can only speak for my portable that runs ~3.4v IIRC.  Probably a safe universal point to shoot for around 3.0-3.1v assuming the SRAM's datasheet supports.  My napkin shows that's probably somewhere around 4.4k on R1.  You're right though, it should be verified with the real deal and probably a small population of transistors.  I'm planning to do this testing, once I get around to it I'll post my results in a separate thread.
