I even was able to briefly get an almost perfect menu yesterday but when I booted a game is was as unplayable. I tough it might be the connection with the 60 to 72 pic adapter even though I tested with multimeter so to completely rule that out I soldered it directed to one of the adapter like this:

<br /><a href="http://skinnyv.com/Cart/245in1/Direct_Connect.JPG" class="postlink">http://skinnyv.com/Cart/245in1/Direct_Connect.JPG</a>
<br />
<br />Test each connection with a multimeter for continuity and for short. All was perfect. Tested it ion my NES, corrupted graphic, and not the nice one like on the picture. I must say it is a very strange cart. 
<br />
<br />So I'm at a loss once again:) By the way, I was still wondering about the VCC, I've been instructed to lift the RAM's VCC pin and connect to +5v on edge connector but I don't think it was running on 3V at all, it seem to be connected directly to pin 30 of the Famicom edge connector which, as far as I know is 5v...

<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/img/images/thwaite.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />It turns out dumping the cart and comparing hex files, that the very first byte in CHR memory is corrupt.  It's 0xA0 and supposed to be 0x00.  I still haven't figured out why exactly.  But I had a similar problem where the first byte in PRG memory was programming improperly.  It ended up fixing it's self when I realized the retrozone cart I was using had the /CE line on the PRG memory tied to GND.  So basically anything that was being write controlled by PRG /CE was failing, but writes that were controlled by PRG /WR were working properly.  Connecting the /CE pin to PRG /CE actually fixed a lot of other problems I had too with corrupt data and in ability to battery back my SRAM well also.
<br />
<br />I don't know if all this helps much but it's one way I was able to get horizonal lines with a completely different setup.  My error is in the writing process to the SRAM not reading it.  Basically it makes me think that it's corrupting data for something like the first byte of several or most tiles or something.  That gives a horizontal line and the follow on bytes of the tile or block of memory program properly.  IDK I'm making a lot of guesses on how things are actually working but it sounds possible to me atleast.
<br />
<br />When you checked all the lines did you compare it to the pin out of the SRAM?  Like did you ensure the /CE line is actually connected to CHR A13 on the cart edge?  I would recommend checking all the control signals making sure they make sense where they wire them up.  That's basically why I had issues, the board is designed for EPROM or FLASH where it wouldn't be an issue grounding /CE and not letting the NES actually enable the chip.  But it caused hell with my SRAM even though the pinout was the same.  I know it's a different story on the CHR side with VRAM and all but it atleast gives you something to look at.  Perhaps if I find my error on the CHR side it'll be related to yours as well, I haven't figured out why I'm having an issue with that first byte...

<br />
<br />I can see /OE grounded, it doesn't allow for making use of CHR /RD signal but it's not of much concern.
<br />
<br />So what does CHR A13 line do?  This is should basically one of the /CE signals for the VRAM.  Double check to see if it's tied to either of the /CE pins on the SRAM.
<br />
<br />If it's not connected I'm really surprised now that I think about it a little more.  The /CE line MUST be low when writing or reading to/from VRAM, and it only makes sense for what's tring to Read and Write (the NES) to have control of /CE.  For the mapper to have complete control of /CE the mapper basically doesn't give control where it belongs.  If this is really the case it's a backasswards design and super difficult to time properly.  I'm suprised it even works in a clone...  Based on the fact you're getting different glitches every time supports the possibility of a timing issue, since the Mapper can't very well know what to do with /CE when.  
<br />
<br />I'd be curious what would happen if you connected CHR A13 to the spare /CE2 that's currently tied to Vcc.  If it wasn't obvious you'd want to make sure you cut a trace or somehow removed it from Vcc, you could double check by checking the resistance of the CHR A13 line to Vcc afterwards and ensure it wasn't low (like less than 1K ohms).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I didn't check the datasheet for this part, but the 2nd CE line almost certainly a positive-enable, so it being at +5V has it enabled (both CE's must be enabled).
<br />
<br />So if the VCC pin for the RAM is at 5V, then I guess they were running the original 3V RAM chip at that.. strange.
<br />
<br />There's nothing stopping the mapper from taking CHR A13 (or /A13) and then having it's own output to the CHR /CE on the RAM.  The only reason I can think of for doing that, is if the mapper was also controlling the "CIRAM /CE", then it could map nametables into it's the cart's CHR-RAM (which would allow 4-screen mode, and nametable banking, which are kinda rare features).
<br />
<br />I wonder, is the voltage of the clone really 5V?  Maybe NES maskROMs and mappers can run at 3.3V, I can't say I've tried it or would know what to expect.

<br />This is true in the case of one CHR memory. But when you have a split CHR ROM (e.g. <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_068#Hardware" class="postlink">mapper 68</a>), or both CHR ROM and CHR RAM (e.g. <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/TQROM" class="postlink">TQROM</a> or <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_192" class="postlink">its Chinese clone</a>), or allowing nametables and pattern tables to share one memory as Memblers mentioned (also mapper 68), you need the mapper to postprocess the PA10-PA13 to come up with the enables for CHR memories.

<br />
<br />Anyway, I did notice that CV3 does not boot at all when using the wall wart supplied with the Yobo (goes to grey screen). It does boot when using mine, but fails to enter game play due to the CIRAM bug.

All you need to do is simply desolder OE pin from CHR-RAM and solder it to unused CHR/RD pin 17:<br /><img src="http://img607.imageshack.us/img607/240/150in1fix01mwk.jpg" alt="Image" />
