		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Congrats on the new one hope all are healthy and well!<br /><br />I actually missed out on the birth, first words, and first steps Of my oldest while I was deployed.  So one of my proudest firsts I got to witness was her beating the first level of SMB for the first time.  My 4 year old probably plays as more NES than anything but she still spends time on the SNES, N64, wii and gameboy.  Although her attention span per game is much shorter on the NES, she goes in spurts from one console to another.  She only plays 1-2 games on each console, except the NES.  Her favorite thing to do with the NES is randomly pick a game that looks good out of the cabinet which reminds me of how I acquired most of them <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If anyone here has any tips on how to conciliate our kind of hobby with being a family man, I'm all ears! =)</div><br /><br />I really don't think it's as hard as it sounds.  We had our second child nearly a year ago.  I'm pretty sure I wrote a few thousand lines of code with our then newborn in my lap.  The difficulty comes when they realize how awesome the keyboard is and they try to attack it whenever in sight.  There isn't much I can't do with a kid in my lap which helps, so perhaps thats a skill/tip to work towards.  Software is also significantly easier to work on than hardware with young ones so most of you have that advantage.<br /><br />The other thing that goes a LONG way in things more than just deving is keeping them involved with your interests even when they're really too young.  Figuring out ways for them to help out when they are ~3+ years old allows you to work on your hobby while entertaining/teaching them.  For me I always ask for help testing things, or maching things up before final assembly.  Kids are also FULL of ideas for things like games, and love to draw.  So those are integratable skills for deving also.  <br /><br />Aside from hobbies I think getting the older one involved and helping out when the second child comes around is also a huge key to help them cope with the family change and shift in attention.

That's a fun think to know.<br /><br />@Tokumaru, I agree it'd be very hard to combine fun hobbies with a family. It'd be possible but then you'd probably be a terrible father, taking more care of you computer than your own children, which is not a good idea (even if technically possible).<br />Even though I'm a lot into computers and technical stuff, I have to admit social links between people have probably never been so damaged in history because of computers, as people care more about virtual stuff than the real people that are around them which is sad.<br /><br />You have to make choices in your life I guess....<br />I'll prefer having some fun hobbies myself, the world is already overpopulated enough (at least in my country), and I have my nephews (from now on with a s) for a nice change if I want to do child-ish things. I might change my mind later though.<br /><br />As for people saying congratulations I'll just add that while having a baby is easy, rising him/her is the really hard part. I don't want to say anything negative or anything, this is just the reality.<br /><br />In short :<br />Still I wish you best of luck and a lot of pleasure in rising your children, Clueless. I hope you'll be able to continue some sparse NESdev, but I perfectly understand if you don't.

So family fun isn't part of your vocab?<br /><br />I'm not sure how many children you've given birth to Bregalad, but I'd like to see you try and convince the women I know that having a baby is easy...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Sorry but parenthood is not the end of your hobby/fun life unless you want it to be.  In my opinion it only makes that hobby/fun time more enjoyable.  Your welcome to your opinion Bregalad.  If one's only hobby were drinking at the bar I'd agree with you.  I just hope everyone else doesn't see it the same way and feel they have to abandon their hobbies (and nesdev) as new or soon to be parents.  Unless you also think all parents who are active on nesdev must be terrible, there are plenty of us here who are proof of that it can be done.

Saying the opposite would be a straight dishonest lie, or someone who never actually dealt with a baby or a young child.<br />Children needs that you pay attention to them <em>all the time</em>. You can't just sit in front of your TV, your computer or whatever else and let them play alone. Or if you do, you'll probably not a good parent. But I'm not one to juge whenever other people are good parents.
