For example, &quot;what other people do with their own money&quot; is buy video game consoles instead of gaming PCs, which forces third-party developers to spend extra money on the overhead of obtaining a console devkit just to make and sell their games. And because &quot;what other people do with their own money&quot; is buy PCs, you can't be sure that GNU/Linux will work on a brand new major brand laptop (see DebianOn listings for <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Asus/T100TA" class="postlink">T100TA</a> and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Asus/X205TA" class="postlink">X205TA</a>).

I've always been too ambitious with my own creations, and used to look down on simpler projects. But now I can see the merit of the smaller games, and I'd honestly much rather have one fun, well polished, single screen puzzle game under my belt than nothing at all. You can shine making whatever kind of game you want, just work well and make sure you're releasing a polished product, not a half-assed mess that barely works.

It's the same reason you need to buy a Nintendo 3DS to play <em>Animal Crossing: New Leaf</em> or <em>Super Smash Bros. For</em>, even if you use a PlayStation Vita or an Android-powered tablet for the rest of your gaming.

However, I've yet to re-restart, as I think I should probably design a GUI first - if I have to manually put in one more note I'll explode.<br />As for actual tracks, I have 8 total, with one or two in rough state, three reasonably complete, and the rest in between. (Most of them aren't yet assigned to a specific level.) I finally got the overworld track written, by fiddling around and stumbling upon something that just clicked. No earlier attempt got an appropriate feel, and even still the one I ended up with is a little pop-like, but it's the best I've done so far, and I'm actually a bit proud of it.<br />Unfortunately (once again <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> ) I can't really show you guys anything right now, since I haven't been directly using any music engine for writing--<br /><div class="quotetitle">Alp wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But this game, and all other game-related projects is CANCELLED.</div>Oh.<div class="quotetitle">Alp wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If my game didn't have a dedicated composer, this reaction would have made me dump the game in the Recycle Bin, and called it a day.</div>...

To think that it's my best attempt at something that sounds menacing...<br /><br />0-title.mp3: I'd put this further down, but you've probably heard this track before.<br /><br />1-menu.mp3: Same.<br /><br />trash.mp3: One of my first attempts at an overworld/title theme. Obviously inadequate.<br /><br />fast.mp3: Another attempt at overworld/title; fortunately, less inadequate.<br /><br />4-forest.mp3: I knew that a lot of my stuff would end up either &quot;sounding sad&quot; or &quot;sounding happy&quot;, so I decided to write the Forest Temple first of the temples, because that was the first and most light-hearted.<br /><br />5-lake.mp3: Sounds like forest, i.e., not really appropriate for any other temple's theme, let alone the water temple's.<br /><br />2-overworld.mp3: I might have overstated the quality of this track. I'm not proud of how it sounds <strong>now</strong> - I haven't written any other parts or transitions. Had I 20-30 hours to work on all of these, I would have been able to consider most of them complete AND acceptable.

But, I think that if you dropped the drums and made it smoother, it would work great for a opening title theme.<br /><br />Some of these are pretty good. If anyone else is working on a Zelda game, maybe you can still use them.<br /><br /><br />(On an unrelated note, it looks like Alp took down all the pictures of the game. Two years from now, if someone is looking through old posts and wondering what this game looked like - it was a bit like Link to the Past.)
