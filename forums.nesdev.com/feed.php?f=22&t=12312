It's kind of weird seeing people like that who have either been on the website for one year and then quit but still did a bunch of posts, but what is even more strange to me is seeing accounts from 2006, that don't even have a single post... (I really don't get it.) I wonder, are those accounts ever going to be deleted, or are they just going to stay their forever? I think its safe to say no one is going to use them. Also, just for the heck of it, here's a map of Texas, with the top red shape being where I live and the bottom red shape being the person closest to me.<br /><br />2000px-Map_of_Texas_highlighting_Nacogdoches_County_svg.png<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Mon Feb 02, 2015 11:06 pm</p><hr />

I'm in Ontario, Canaada, near Toronto. (Until recently was living in Toronto.)<br /><br /><br />As for desktop customization, I mostly tend to try to stick with defaults unless it's something that actually bothers me. That way if I ever use someone else's computer I will be familiar with the way it will most likely be set up. I'd like to be ready to drop-in on any computer I see, rather than sit down and be frustrated by the lack of customizations/extensions that I am so used to using constantly... For the most part I really just want the OS GUI to get out of my way and just let me run programs; I don't really care too much how it does this as long as it works okay. (Windows 8 is the first OS in a long while that I thought actually had something wrong with it in this respect.)<br /><br />My pet peeve in this respect is antialiased fonts.

This has nothing to do with the original thread, but I agree the decrease of customisation for Windows' GUI is awful. And every time someone sees me on Win7 they scream and believes I'm still using windows 98, because I use the &quot;Windows Classic&quot; theme, and apparently <em>most people didn't even go to the customisation screen since XP (and 7) to see that there is a fallback mode available.</em><br /><br />It's sad but it seems 90% of the people just use the default is available to them and don't even look for options and customisation. And needless to say I do not like most of the changes that has been made recently to desktops, no matter if it is Windows, Gnome or KDE. Completely bloated, why didn't just keep them simple like they were before ? Even LDXE, the supposedly &quot;lightweight&quot; desktop for Linux is bloated, as windows comes with so many buttons in the top bar I don't know what is their purpose, and defaults to 4 desktops, which I don't need, 1 is enough, thanks. I still think the &quot;Windows 95&quot; style is the best desktop you could ever get, and I also regret to the absence of pre-made colouring theme in &quot;Windows Classic&quot; mode, but I still use it as I never liked XP, and W2k is way too old to support new hardware.<br /><br />This has hardly anything to do with Nesdev except maybe the &quot;nostalgia&quot; thing, which may in fact have a bit influence on out opinion about desktops.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jan 30, 2015 7:50 am</p><hr />
