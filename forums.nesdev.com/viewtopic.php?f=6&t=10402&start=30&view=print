Don't use Qt FamiTracker for anything serious...yet.  It is very much a beta beta and there's still some things in it that I know are not quite right [keyboard shortcuts, etc.] but progress is slowly being made.

But #define does what #define does...regardless of scope...oh well.  I have posted to FamiTracker forum and we'll just carry on with the change on our side.  When you're satisfied with the OpenBSD build would you mind creating a pull request on GitHub for the necessary changes [including this one]?

Personally, I don't feel that great about needing Java just do MIDI. Since MIDI isn't crucial, you might use PortMidi but make it a completely optional component at build-time. (EDIT:) Granted, of course, those are all things you should probably have installed as a programmer anyway.<br /><br />I'm just thinking about this in the case of maintaining a BSD port for Nesicide in the future.

If it succeeds, I'm really curious how it will look and work, or if it will at all, on Android... And yes, I have those wine headers on my Nexus now.<br /><br />I emailed the author of C4droid about building FamiTracker and got this quick (and slightly snarky) response: <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Qt can't be used at the same time with SDL, these input/output systems are independent and incompatible on Android.<br />P.S.

I mean it sounds like frames of audio were being repeated, and low pitches were distorted beyond recognition. The slowdown tended to increase when I navigated through menus and dialogs and especially when I alt-tabbed to Firefox to write my testing report. Xfce Task Manager reported fairly high CPU usage.<br /><br />Yesterday, I got FCEUX audio working in Wine. So it appears Wine audio improved greatly from the version in 10.04 to the version I'm running.<br /><br />EDIT: <a href="https://github.com/christopherpow/nesicide/blob/master/TODO" class="postlink">cpow's burn-down list</a></div><br /><br />When I was using Linux, I've had similar issue to what you are describing. What I've done was to stop using shitty ALSA and used PulseAudio. If you are already PulseAudio, please tell me your PA configuration. Maybe all that is needed is to change few things? Most likely when I'll see your PA configuration (if you are already using it), I'd be able to tell what's wrong.

I'd try disabling dmix before I tried <em>enabling</em> that piece of crap.
