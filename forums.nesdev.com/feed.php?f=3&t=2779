Well, about Cobra Triangle... after you press start, it checks the VBlank flag.

Disch is doing about the best possible short of actual hardware tests: careful reasoning about what can and can't be the case. It's about as far from hacking as possible. I'll have to double-check these things Disch mentions, because some of my notes suggested that the PPU powers up just after the end of vblank (though the VBL flag is also set).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Dec 12, 2006 12:47 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">WedNESday wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'd consider that a hack.<br /></div><br /><br />I suppose that depends on your definition of a hack.  I would consider a hack to be the employ of behavior you know to be wrong in order to get games which normally don't work to work.  Since the exact behavior of this isn't known -- I think of this as more of a semi-educated guess than a hack.<br /><br />But you don't have to take my word for it.  Trace these games (Cobra Triangle, Time Lord) for yourself to see how I came to this conclusion.  Both games use DMC IRQs, but neither disables or acknowledges Frame IRQs -- all they do is switch to 5-step mode.  Blargg has already confirmed that switching to 5-step mode when a frame IRQ is pending will <em>not</em> acknowledge the Frame IRQ, and also that the APU does indeed start in 4-step mode with IRQs enabled -- therefore the only way these games can work is if they switch to 5-step mode <em>before</em> the frame IRQ trips.<br /><br />If you start at the start of VBlank (or earlier), the first two $2002 read loops will cause the game to wait too long before switching modes -- and if $2002.7 isn't high right away, it'll wait even longer (over 1 full frame).  Therefore the obvious solution would be for startup time to fall somewhere in vblank.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Tue Dec 12, 2006 11:51 am</p><hr />

Yes, it <strong>is</strong> a hack. I already traced Cobra Triangle startup and could compare the reset/startup. The VBlank flag must be enabled. So, you cannot really say <em>"it doesn't matter the startup point"</em>. Plus, it's NOT correct to affirm my procedure (or yours) is RIGHT and the Disch is WRONG. ^_^;; It's a way to get the things working while no official thing pops up.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Tue Dec 12, 2006 5:57 am</p><hr />

(it's impossible for a game to have timed writes to rely on said behavior because the CPU is just too slow -- so any time such a thing happens, the point on the screen at which the change takes place will shake around on the scanline -- see SMB3 status bar and MM3 enemy select screen... the distortion flickers around every frame -- so you can't tell whether or not it's 1 or 2 pixels off).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon Dec 04, 2006 12:18 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1. Why is there no BCD support on the NES's 6502? I mean, I wouldn't of thought that it would of been to save cash.<br /></div><br />It saves a considerable amount of transistors inside the chip. No idea why the decimal mode in particular was removed, but at least it is.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />2. Why did the NES have so many mappers, while the GameBoy only had a handful?<br /></div><br />Mainly because 90% of iNES mappers are chineese pirates. The other 10% contain about 7% of custom made boards (like Konami, Sunsoft, Bandai and so on), and about 3% of mapper were officially made by Nintendo. The values here are just an evaluation by me to show you the main thing, not result of any exact calculation. In other word, 95% of games uses the last 3% of mappers. I think rich developpers think it would just be better to developp their own boards and mappers, to have a wider range of available features. Why this isn't done on the Game Boy, I have no idea. However, the Game Boy has better protection than the famicom (wich actually had none at all), I think the GameBoy has a bios that deals with checksum and so to verify the game is licenced. So yeah, the Famicom had no protection and that's why chinese have created lots of custom made pirated cart, and each one with it's own circuitry, so it's own mapper.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />3. Why aren't the NES's registers stored in Zero Page like they are on the Atari 2600? I know that the NES didn't have that much RAM, but what is 20 odd bytes lost when you can save so many cycles when accessing them.<br /></div><br />This is just one thing Nintendo chosen, I think it would be wastefull to have an area stored in both RAM and register. That would means all registers are read-buffered (a la $2007), wich would tend to be somewhat annoying. Also, I think RAM is a much more usefull use of page-zero than registers, that are acessed somewhat rarely (well, that COULD save time in VBlank, but I don't think it'd make so much difference in the long term, and Nintendo didn't care about that when developping the Famicom).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Dec 04, 2006 9:47 am</p><hr />
