True, but remember they had no mapper IRQs to work with !<br /><br />Also, it's fun how the status bar stays in place but the other raster effects are disabled during the sound effect. I guess they stop the sound completely between the start of the VBlank and the end of the end of the status bar every frame, which makes the sound effects sound weird/distorted (it doesn't matter that much since it's sound effects).<br /><br />That also explains why the sound effects plays at a lower rate on the snake level and last level, the status bar is longer because they needed to update more tiles to VRAM every frame.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />On a related not I'm really curious how Rad Racer works, since it seems to do scanline scrolling with an MMC1 somehow.

Then it synchronizes with a sprite zero hit that happens at a variable pixel position but always just one scanline before the start of the road part.<br />Then there is several lines where the game writes an adress to $2006 every 2 scanlines for the 3d look of the road, in a addition with $2005 writes for the curve of the road. This section also vary in length, but added with the background section, is always a constant.<br />Then comes the part where there is only $2005 writes for the curve of the road, and finally comes the status bar which of course is fixed.<br />All those timings depend on the synchronization with the sprite zero hit.<br /><br />Rad Racer 2 is similar the only difference is that there is no sprite zero hits, and the initial synchronization is done with an IRQ instead. However, the other split points are still synced with timed code from the first IRQ. I don't remember if there was a second IRQ for the status bar but it would be easy to check.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2012 9:42 am</p><hr />

I never realized Battletoads' Turbo Tunnel level was a raster effect. I'd always assumed it was like the other scrolling effects in the game (careful CHR-RAM tile cycling), since the differently-scrolling portion was tileable anyway. That game has a little bit of everything in it though. One thing I've always wondered... that differently-scrolled part of the background in this level flickers sometimes with punches/kicks. I sometimes consider maybe it's just a bug they left in?<br /><br />I've done a partial analysis of Rad Racer; I'll create a thread for it once I've got a bit more information on it (I think it's pretty interesting), but it is indeed just carefully timed code for the most part (after a sprite 0 hit at the start of the road).<br /><br />Edit: after looking at it, the top of the battletoads turbo tunnel screen before the first split appears to be timed code, and the second split to halfway down the screen a sprite 0 hit. A lot of other crazy stuff is going on, like the code that updates PPU data each frame appears to be written to $0700-$0800... dynamically generated code? Very interesting. I'm sure there would be a lot to learn from the Battletoads source code.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2012 2:32 am</p><hr />

The NES can do parallax/raster effects without mapper IRQs, it's just a bit harder and less practical. You need a way to synchronize with the PPU, which can be done with the vertical blank (you can detect the start or end of it in various ways), a sprite 0 hit, a sprite overflow, or even APU IRQs (these are really tricky!), and then some timed code. With these methods you typically waste more CPU time to pull off the effects than if you used a mapper with IRQs though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Feb 04, 2012 8:00 pm</p><hr />

Ofcourse you can have a hacky implementation for PAL but it's just not meant for it normally. <br /><br />And that defeats the point of having extra CHR for sprites if you are using up a bank like that. For example in Gradius II, the game uses sprites from the BG side of the pattern tables which makes MMC3 unsuitable.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sat Feb 04, 2012 1:17 pm</p><hr />

Or you could start running the cycle counter right after the first PHA of the NMI handler. That'd need a change for PAL NES, but not for Dendy style PAL clones. The maximum variation you'd get in the starting point would be roughly the difference between the shortest instruction (2 cycles) and the longest official instruction (7 cycles), which is slightly less than the expected sprite 0 hit variation (7-12 cycles depending on how you handle a timeout).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Feb 04, 2012 8:29 am</p><hr />
