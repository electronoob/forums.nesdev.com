Like the example famitracker file, where would those addresses be in that? Thanks for anybody that answers my question. =)

<br />According to the <a href="http://gilgalad.panicus.org/nsf_level/nsfspec.txt" class="postlink">.nsf spec</a>, a .nsf file consists of a 128-byte header segment (which is not loaded into NES CPU address space) followed by several 4096-byte PRG ROM segments (which are).
<br />
<br />The load, init, and play addresses are located in header at $08, $0A, and $0C respectively and refer to CPU addresses in $8000 through $FFFF. The bytes from $70 through $78 control which PRG ROM segments get loaded into CPU space at load time, but I don't understand how they interact with bankswitching.

But okay, those addresses are also what I am confused about. What address are they referring to? Like in the NES program, in the NSF file itself, what? I'm just confused about that. So if an NSF is incbined at $8000 in a NES program, and the init adress is $8000, or so it says in the header, where would you actually jump to? And should the header be removed before being put into the ROM? Sorry, NSF files have always been my feild that lacks knowledge in NESdev.

<br />
<br />1. Grab the music driver code from the webpage. (Written for CC65's assembler.)
<br />
<br />2. You must choose a memory location where you want to place the music data. (There must be enough free space, try creating a NSF to see how much is needed.) 
<br />Then fill the 'music data address'-field with that location and press the 'Write BIN'-button to create a music data file.
<br />
<br />3. Tell the driver the same address (the SONG_OFFSET constant).
<br />Include the driver (may be anywhere) and the music code (at your chosen address) into your code. Call 'sound_init' to initialize the driver, and then periodically call 'sound_driver' to play the music.
<br />
<br />I don't think anyone have used this in a program before, so I'd like to hear what you think. (If there's anything you want to change or something).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a little confused about what you are telling me to do. I think you should make an option on FamiTracker to make an NSF that'll be already totally usable by a NES ROM. So just make an option that's like: "Make Usable" and it'll make an NSF that will have no header, and the NSF maker will tell you the addresses of init/play/load addresses of the songs, so you can just throw it into a rom with this code:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;.inesprg 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.ineschr 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.inesmir 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.inesmap 0<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.zp<br />LowVar: .ds 1<br />HighVar: .ds 1<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.code<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.bank 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.org $FFFA<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.dw nmi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.dw reset<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.dw irq<br /><br />init = $8xxx<br />play = $8xxx<br />load = $8xxx <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.bank 0<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.org $8000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;.incbin &quot;example.nsf&quot;<br /><br />reset:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #%00011111<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $4015<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; lda #1 ; song 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ldx #1 ; NTSC speed<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr init<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda #%10000000 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta $2000 ; &lt;- enable play after init<br /><br />loop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jmp loop<br /><br /><br />nmi:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jsr play<br /><br />irq:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; rti </div>
<br />
<br />And you'll be all ready to go. I don't know. I've always hated NSF files, they're nothing but trouble to me. I've never in my life successfully put an NSF that I've made into a NES ROM. So if you could make it as simple as possible for me, that'd be really cool of you <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> . I can do a whole ton of other crap in 6502, I'm not a newbie, I know what I'm doing, but I really don't understand NSFs at all, or why mine don't work.

<br />
<br />Using nesasm makes things a bit more complicated, but it's still possible to assemble the music driver separately and then merge the files.
<br />
<br />The easiest way to get an NSF running (that's made in famitracker): 
<br />remove the header (first 128 bytes), load the file at $8000 and call $8000 to init the song and $8003 to play it.
<br />
<br />This code works, just remove the first 128 bytes from the NSF.

<br />The driver is 3.4 kB, and a typical NES song (my enl_end.nsf in this case) uses about 3 kB (DPCM samples excluded).
<br />
<br />I don't think the music format is a big problem.
<br />The driver would need some optimizations though, but mostly to decrease the CPU usage. I haven't really focused that much on the driver this far, as the goal has been getting the tracker usable, but it's probably time for that now.

I know in NT2, you have to press space over the section that you want the song to go to when the song reaches the end, but how is this done in FamiTracker?

<br />
<br />There is no easy way right now, but you can modify the playback code to load music from different addresses depending on the x register in the init routine.
<br />
<br />I'll add real support for multitrack files some time.
