The loops are really only important if you want looped/chip samples.</div><br />Granted. Though i meant was that if you happen to use looped samples anyway*, you also may get some short notes this way as a side bonus. A lot less useful than i thought now that rainwarrior taught me the use of the == stop. That makes their use limited to sub-step note lengths, percussive addons, staccato gaps and the like.  <br /><br />*I think the main reason to go for tonal loops is to conserve space. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">[...]a lot of redundancy in the set, and if you pick samples with divisions that are close to each other they should be closer in sound as well</div><br /><br />Yeah, it's quite doable to organize them as a few somewhat different sounding voices by grouping if you'd want to, or just focus on one characteristic that works for the song/songs. <br /><br />I spent a lot of yesterday messing about with the samples. At first i looked at bytes per non-overlapping note as a sort of value, but then came to prioritize that all samples would be within a couple of hundred bytes. + for the 'value' to work best, you kind of need to know what notes you're going to use.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you are going for conserving space it is indeed the best solution, especially when you want to simultaneously do something unusual for an NES game. I once wrote a demo song that tries to sound &quot;advanced&quot; while only using the base hardware features, including a looped DPCM waveform made from an FM bass guitar patch.
