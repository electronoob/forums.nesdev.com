You still need a PLL somewhere. I guess you could start with the actually-purchasable 4x crystal and use a 3x PLL in that case.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It'd be far too obnoxious to recover the level with a 4-bit ADC since you'd need equipment and skills to develop a preprocessing circuit for level shifting and biasing. Instead you could stick a very typical 8-bit ADC between VDD &amp; VSS and maybe have enough resolution, or definitely have enough with a simple resistive VDD/2 bias, since the DAC should swing 0.7V somewhere around VSS.<br /><br />For a really low cost, high speed ADC you could probably bias the CMOS inputs (or better yet differential inputs) to act as comparators, but that would take quite a bit of wizardry...

But an array of 15 trimpots and 15 comparators is awfully hard to screw up.

The global palette lookup is 512 * 24 bits (but could be reduced by using less bits for RGB and calculating the emphasis dynamically). Shadow palette is about 16 * 6 bits and scanline buffers are 512 * 9 bits each (extra space is for borders, could be optimized). Logic utilization is at about 1% if I remember correctly, there's not a lot of it.
