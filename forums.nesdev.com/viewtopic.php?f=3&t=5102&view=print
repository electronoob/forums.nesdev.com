<br />
<br />In first moment I thougth in run a separete thread to ppu but now I guess it could be harder...
<br />

<br />
<br />Sorry for the code that is not the real one! I've worked mainly on cpu core (I believe that I "close" the opcodes [not illegal]) and moving forward to ppu.

I suggest keeping the cpu and ppu separate.  I have catch up that is called when ever the cpu reads or writes a ppu register.  The cpu and ppu have their own clocks.   There is also prediction code for nmi, but i think you need to get your ppu started before you do that.   And if you want to have working nmi, then you can still code for catch up, but only run in tiny cpu increments and catch the nmi when it really happens.  This will be slower but good for getting started.

<br />I'm always arguing against going multithreaded at work for otherwise trivial tasks, it's one of those rookie developer mistakes (among using other "cool" technologies/buzzwords where they are inappropriate).

<br />I keep differents classes to Ppu and Cpu... the connection between them is made by a third class called Emulator.
<br />The ppu has you own clocks ok, but it will influency on the emulation... 
<br />
<br />I'm based my timming on : (cpu cycling)
<br />
<br />Each 114 cycles of cpu I made one of 240 scanlines...
<br />Then I plus 3 (or 2) scanlines and the Ppu enter on VBLANK timming, so I made the VBLANK things (check nmi, zero to bit0detection) on 20 scanlines timming then I exit of VBLANK period  and start again the 0th line scanline...

<br />I'm also don't like to use BUZZWORD I have a couple of articles published on magazines talking about buzzwords ... fancy developer... I just wondering the two threads by what I've read...

<br />I agree with you that multithread can made slower the nes emulator... but in some cases as game cube or ps2  (or even the psp) emulators the multithread is needed and improve the speed too.

<br />I'm just wondering ... do you deal with ppu cycling on your ppu class or even on emulator?

My ppu code has its own time stamp or clock.  So if the cpu does 30 cpu clock cycles, then my ppu would do 30 * ( 3 for ntsc and 3.2 for pal) clock cycles.   Actually, cpu 5, ntsc ppu 15, pal ppu 16, you can find alot of info about that all over here.
