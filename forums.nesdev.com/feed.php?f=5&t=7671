Some of my favorites:<br /><br />Balloon Kid / Balloon Fight GB - My favorite early GB platformer (Moreso than Super Mario Land).  It stands apart from most platformers in that only the ground enemies kill you while the airborne ones pop your balloons.  For only 8 stages each one presents more variety in the level design and the last two stages are a beast.  Plus it's a challenge to beat every stage perfectly (collect all the balloons without dying).<br /><br />Has anyone ever played the two-player game?  It must be like Balloon Fight but I've never even seen footage of it!<br /><br />Wario Land II - Probably my favorite game on GB or GBC.  You just tear shit up and explore.  Wario Land III is a close second but that game isn't much fun until you have all the abilities.<br /><br />Samurai Kid - A very obscure game with three different weapons for the title character: a katana, fan and jug that turns certain enemies into blocks.  I haven't got very far but this will be one of my favorite games once the puzzles are knocked out.<br /><br />Spanky's Quest - It's monkey bouncing a ball on his head to power it up and unleash it as a spreadshot of divebombs.  How cool is that?<br /><br />Nail n Scale - Simple tile graphics and great concept, you throw nails at the blocks and jump on them.  Stuck on this one too but I want to beat it.  Boss battles are very lame (shoot them when they spit).<br /><br />Burning Paper - Very simple and innovative, you control a robot on a rooftop blasting insects off the side of the building.  The best part, you can cut apart billboards and drop them on the bugs.  Also has reflex straining boss battles.<br /><br />Donkey Kong Land - This is the only portable DKC title I really like.  At least it tries to be a different game and not just a SNES port with different layouts.  Pretty much unplayable on the first GB model and must be played on GB Pocket, Super GB, etc.<br /><br />Kirby's Dreamland - Even though it doesn't have the polish or features of later Kirby games, and you can only spit enemies (no enemy powers in the first Kirby game), I still like to tear through it just for the extra difficult game, which is pretty tough.<br /><br />Mortal Kombat II - Considering the platform it's on, the controls are fluid and the graphics are readable.  It's a dumb game but good for a session on the john.<br /><br />Best GBC game that isn't - Ninja Senki looks so much like a GBC game I'm including it here.<br /><br />If I had a request for SatoshiMatrix, it would be the top 25 N64 games not by Nintendo or Rare, if you're really familiar with JPN games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3506">strat</a> — Sat Apr 23, 2011 12:09 pm</p><hr />

So many good games in that list.<br /><br />I am also pleased Wario Land made it into the top 5. My favorite gameboy title for sure.<br />Oh, and being a huge sucker for Sunsoft games like Gimmick and Ufouria, I am very happy to see Trip World got a spot in there as well. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1377">miau</a> — Thu Apr 21, 2011 11:51 pm</p><hr />

I actually don't have many complaints.  <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Things I'm pleased about&#058;</span><br /><br />Donkey Kong '94: Admittedly I haven't played it as much as I should have, but I remember REALLY liking this game. <br /><br />Wario Land: This is one of my favorite games period. Easily makes my top 25 games across all consoles. <br /><br />Then of course there's Link's Awakening/Kirby's Dreamland 2 and others, but they sorta had to be there anyway. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Game I don't agree with:</span><br /><br />Tetris: I think Tetris DX beats the hell out of the "original" Tetris in every gameplay related aspect, but I understand why Tetris had to be included, and TDX would have been another slot. <br /><br />Super Mario Land/2: I suppose the first is decent, but it's really short.  I'm also not a huge fan of the second. The first definitely had to be included though, just like Tetris.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Some I'd have included:</span>  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Mario Tennis: This game beats the N64 version, and every other tennis game I've ever played. Truly splendid. <br /><br />Game and Watch Gallery(1, 2, or 3): High score fest games are not for everyone, but I play them a lot. <br /><br />There are others like the Game Boy Camera/Kirby's Tilt and Tumble, but those are definitely not for everyone. I was always impressed by the depth of secrets in that camera though...<br /> <br />Of course it's all opinion, they're just here for the sake of discussion, not to change the (pretty solid) list. <br /><br />Though I hear there's a runner up list coming...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Thu Apr 21, 2011 6:28 pm</p><hr />

the problem is no matter what list I come up with, there will be those who disagree. Dragon Warrior 3 is a good runner up for my list though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4236">SatoshiMatrix</a> — Thu Apr 21, 2011 1:30 pm</p><hr />
