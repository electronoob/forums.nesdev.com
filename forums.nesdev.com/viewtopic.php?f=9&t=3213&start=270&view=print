<br />I don't see too much of a reason against a Mario Adventure submapper, given that quite a few other mappers are used on fewer than 5 games: MMC2 in PNROM (Punch-Out!!), CPROM (Videomation), MMC3 in TQROM (two Rare pinball games), MMC3 in TLSROM (a couple football games), MMC6 in HKROM (StarTropics 1 and 2), FME-7 (Batman ROTJ and Ufouria), Nichibutsu's bass-ackward version of UNROM (Crazy Climber), etc.

<br />
<br />The author of <em>Mario Adventure</em> should fix his hack to comply with the MMC3 specs, just as the original game where the hack was based on did.
<br />
<br />Now, if someone is to program a game that can't possibly use the existing mappers, then I'm all for the creation of a new mapper with the needed features. If a hardware counterpart exists, even better.
<br />
<br />I just don't think that we need more mappers, specially submappers to accommodate bad code. One of the reasons is that emulators will have a hard time to keep up with all the changes (and old emulators may never support the new ROMs). This is very bad, because if they don't support new homebrew software, they will be seen more like piracy inducers than tools to aid development, something we're all trying to avoid.

<br />
<br />for Tecmo Super Bowl i need 0x340 more bytes of sram then the mmc3 provides to update it to 32 teams. it would be much easier to create a submapper that has multiple sram banks like the mmc5 (possibly with the register in the $5xxx range), then trying to hack it to the mmc5 board (as i'm trying to do). i'm not sure if it's even gonna be possible because the new irq's are causing very noticeable shearing and the 8x16 sprites are a nightmare in themselves.
<br />
<br />i think it depends on your goals. i would like to put this on the extra TSB cart i have, but a new submapper would make that impossible. though emulators could be easily extended.

<br />
<br />Porting an MMC3 to MMC5 is definitely doable.  If you're having IRQ troubles, chances are it's because of two things:
<br />
<br />1. Differences in the IRQ counter.  This will particularly show up if multiple IRQ's are desired in a single frame.
<br />
<br />2. Different timing.  The MMC3's IRQ fires at PPU cycle 260, whereas the MMC5 triggers the IRQ at PPU cycle 0 (a difference of ~87 CPU cycles on NTSC).  You'll need to add an extra delay to the IRQ handler to compensate.
<br />
<br />What's the big deal with 8x16 sprites?  Being an MMC3 game, all sprites should come from $1000-1FFF, so you'd only need to update $5124-5127 for sprite banks.  Background banks are set through $5128-512B in 8x16 mode.  Even if there were sprites from $0000-0FFF, all you'd have to do is be sure $5120-5123 mirrors $5128-512B and you're set.  (I'm not missing something, am I?)

<br />Boy, have we gone off-topic here.

<br />
<br />along those lines i was thinking about using the TQROM board by reading the new save data from sram to chr-ram at start up and writing it back at power down. a good portion of sram is used as game logic ram and needs not be saved at power down. two problems with that is the 64k limitation for chr-rom and the rareity of the board.

In a perfect world, mappers would be created with mapper definitions, specifying all the wiring, what is connected where on the board, what components are used, and the IC's would all be emulated. This would allow for a shit load of new "mappers" without the need to code anything. If all the standard IC's were emulated, new code would only have to be written for new chips, instead of for different board combinations. Then emulators would not support "mappers", but mapper chips.<br /><br />But in the current situation, if new mapper numbers are assigned to each small customization every John Doe makes, it'll be chaos.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It might have to use MMC5 instead.</div><br />Don't all programmers have to deal with hardware limitations?

<br />Bunnyboy said he is waiting on the manuals (the artist is sick).  That's the hold up right now.  Hopefully, we'll see the CF PowerPak Monday or Tuesday.
