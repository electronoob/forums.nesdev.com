		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everybody.<br /><br />As the tittle suggests, I am dealing with a PAL CPU-02 SNES that suffers of Black Screen. I have tested all the obvious things: voltage regulator and fuse are OK, PCB seems OK (I did not find any damage on it and cleaned with alcohol), capacitors look OK (have not tested them), etc.<br /><br />As the power/electrical part seemd to be working, I decided to test the electronics themselfs. I got access to an oscilloscope and started trying things. I had the schematics, so I could get some information about what output to spect from the oscilloscope. I could only test some basic things (controller pins in CPU at HIGH, same for all RESET and the button working well and a few more things). <br /><br />The problem is that I did not find any information around the internet about how to test each chip independently with the oscilloscope. I read the this may be a failing CPU, but how to get sure about it? Next time I have access to an oscilloscope, what pins should I test and what should I expect to get from there to ensure that the chip (CPU or PPU) is working? <br /><br />By the way, taking some measurements, I noticed that, for two different games (SSF II Turbo and Bomberman), for the CPU: JPIO pins are HIGH, D0-D7 there is data through them, same for RAMSEL and CPUSEL, pin 18 LOW, from 19-28 HIGH, 29, 30 and 31 LOW, from 32 to 36 HIGH, 37, 38 and 39 LOW, regular pulses on 40, 41 LOW, 42 LOW, 43 HIGH, 44 LOW, 45 HIGH, 46 noisy and I got tired of taking measurements. I checked that there wasdata through the bus that conected both PPU. I suspect that this &quot;random&quot; measurements are not useful at all, since the system had been turned on for a while when I started taking them (maybe it is more useful to check during boot/reset sequence?). I would not trust a lot these measurements, so I plan to repeat them.<br /><br />I barely know some things about electronics (I'm taking my engineering degree right now). I have experience repairing electronics (old PCs and handheld consoles), but never at a &quot;logic&quot; level I have not found a forum with more SNES experts than this one, so that is why I seek for help out here.<br /><br />Thank you in advantage and sorry for my bad english.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Other than the CPU, as you already tought of, one of the PPU ICs or even the video memories can be the  problem.<br />The best advice I can give is to try to get an SNES test cart.<br />This cart sometimes can display things on screen even when some games can't, wich is a nice way to narrow down problems.<br />Should be a nice start, and it's not too difficult to make a repro of it.<br />Good luck!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for the advie, I will buy some eproms and try. By the way, is there any test cartridge better than others? Any recommendation?<br /><br />And what about testing the CPU by using the oscilloscope? I will have access to on enext week and I would like to know what to test exactly.<br /><br />Thanks.
