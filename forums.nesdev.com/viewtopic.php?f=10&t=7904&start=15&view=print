		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />thanks for your help guys. I got it totally working, at least on my powerpak. I'm hoping that when burning the EPROM for a repro it still ends up behaving correctly. 
<br />
<br />I have one other small thing I'd like to ask if I can. 
<br />
<br />In my list of romhacks I also found a Metroid that starts Samus with 99 Energy units instead of 30 and also apparently has unused graphics. 
<br />
<br />The internet name for this hack is Metroid - Unused GFX Tiles &amp; 99 Energy Units by Grond. 
<br />
<br />I am wondering two things - first if this hack can be used as a base to put on the other three, and the other question I have is just what unused graphics could the hacker be talking about? I wasn't aware Metroid was missing anything. Can someone take a look at the rom and see if they can pull out any sprites that are different/unused?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SatoshiMatrix, it sounds like things got sorted out. It's odd that the map patch has those extra zeros. Anyways, if you do hit a snag, the offer still stands. The 99 life hack is trivial, and as far as the unused gfx goes, there is a small handful of tiles that are unused, Japanese characters excepted. Not even worth mentioning. I played through brinstar, and looked at the rest in Editroid. I didn't see any changed gfx.
<br />
<br />As far as free space, there's actually a lot, but it's not obvious. There's a decent chunk of leftover FDS code that you can overwrite in the fixed bank.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Once again, it seems to work with all the other hacks. The number of bytes different between the Grond hack and the original game is very low. There's one set of changes that seems to be mirrored in 5 banks, and then two bytes different somewhere else. I would doubt this is enough to make any hidden graphics visible in game, but I could be wrong. And if the actual CHR graphics were changed in the hack and not the maps, that's meaningless because it's not unused stuff Nintendo left. It's stuff Grond changed. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />BTW: Satoshi, you may run into a snag when burning it to an EPROM because of the extra bytes MDbtroid adds. I don't think you could mirror it across a 256kb chip, and if you leave it as is on a 256kb chip, something odd might happen.
<br />
<br />MDbtroid might not even use the extra bytes that edittroid seems to have added, so it may be as easy as chopping those off before burning.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh boy, I didn't know that. I myself won't be burning the EPROM; its a friend of mine that will be doing it. 
<br />
<br />From looking over the cartridge itself, Metroid uses a  single 128KB mask rom that combines CHR and PRG and then has two 8KB SRAM chips, the MMC1 and the lockout chip. 
<br />
<br />I didn't consider the size the game would be once the various patches (99 energy, debatably unused graphics, graphic hack via MDbtroid, auto map and wall jump) are applied and what that would do to the size of the rom. What size EPROM will I need for a reproduction? 
<br />
<br />Are you saying that I'll need a 27C020 (256KB) EPROM or something even higher? I sure hope I won't have to use a 27C040. I've been unable to find those anywhere. 256KB is fine, if I need to know so I can try and secure the correct size chip.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The issue is that MDbtoid makes the game larger than 128KB. That means you can't mirror it evenly on 256KB eprom, and it won't fit on a 128KB eprom. Chopping off the extra bytes MDbtroid adds and seeing if it still works fine is what I would do. If so, you could burn it to a 128 KB eprom with no problem. Else, you burn a 256 KB eprom as is and hope the unwritten areas aren't accessed, or are accessed safely.

The powerpak is a pretty good benchmark I've found if something will play correctly once roms are screwed with. my email is satoshimatrix[at]hotmail.com.

So far, it seems to do the trick and is fully playable on the powerpak and on my PSP's NESTERP emulator. I'd like to confirm that there's no problems with it...so if you guys want to test it out that would be great.
