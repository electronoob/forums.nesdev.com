Interestingly, the sprite 0 code isn't run because it waits for a value in the zero page ($60) to be non-zero before running it, so I'll look for clues there as only the code in $C564-$c587 and $c5c6-$c5f7 writes to $60 explicitly.

I guess something to add to the hard to emulate list <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> (it's funny since Super Mario Bros 3 works with some glitches in roof crushing scenes heh). The NMI timing inaccuracy might stem from the fact that I use the best case cycle count for all opcodes in my 6502 and that seems to work for [almost?] all games I've tried so far. Are your cores fairly accurate in cycle count?

(i don't wan't to search the link for your old post, but you remember it don't you?)<br /><br />And no offense to you, but everybody was a begginer at first and needed help (like you) to work around a problem.<br />So, if you think the question or issue somebody expose here is too &quot;noob&quot; remember your old days when you had the Signature &quot;Wednesday,  the best emulator in the net.... well according to the author&quot; and don't reply the noob question if you think so.

It's not like I set the cycle count to 4 for all instructions, I used the correct base values. Anyway, I'm sure someone else who has this problem with bomberman in the future will find this post and not ask the question again thanks to Anes and Zepper's hints towards correct behaviour.
