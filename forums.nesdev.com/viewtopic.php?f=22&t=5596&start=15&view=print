Altough I've always preferred 2D games, it's really exciting to see a (pesudo) 3d engine working on the system that wasn't designed for that. It already looks way better than 3D worldrunner, slalom and stuff like that.

<br />Since the resolution is so low, textures will only look good when you can actually move around, so that if you can't see a texture well you can get closer to it or look at it from different angles.
<br />
<br />I plan to keep the textures pretty simple. Like I said, their size is 8x16 pixels, but as you can see in the videos, the faces of some blocks end up taking only 2 columns of the screen, so there is no way they'll look awesome there, it's impossible to scale 8 to 2 and keep any detail.
<br />
<br />Well, you've probably seen the textures in the Flash demo, it will be exactly like that. The key is to design textures with little horizontal detail, and focus more on vertical detail.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Great job, tokumaru! This raycasting is actually bearable to look at (pretty damn impressive, as a matter of fact), and I would probably enjoy myself if I were playing a game with these graphics. This is pretty hard to do with raycasting on the NES <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .
<br />
<br />Anyways, I do have to agree with Bregalad to some extend about the ground. The dithered pattern looks a little big, and it makes it seem like the ground does not extend into the distance. If you undithered the ground pattern, this wouldn't be the case. Otherwise, the walls look great, it runs smoothly, and I can't wait to see more! I hope you make a cool game out of this or something <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .
<br />
<br />EDIT: I just had a question about the colors. It seems like you have more than 4 colors present for these walls and the ground. I'm assuming the entire image is part of the BG, so I'm wondering if you are working with color attributes in this project? If so, that's very impressive! That must be a nightmare to do. If not, well it's still impressive because it seems to me like there are more than 4 colors visible.

<br />Sorry about the double post, but yes, I could have the ROM up on my site. Well, I wouldn't have info about it, but you could download it from <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/tokumarusROM.NES">www.freewebs.com/the_bott/tokumarusROM.NES</a><!-- w --> or something like that if that's what you were wanting.

IMO, it doesn't look so good in fullscreen, but that's when I'm close to the monitor. Since we usually sit quite far from the TV, it should be OK.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I just had a question about the colors.

<br />You are correct, there are more than 4 colors. There are 5! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />1 = floor/ceiling;
<br />2 = dithering (black);
<br />3 = wall color 1;
<br />4 = wall color 2;
<br />5 = wall color 3;
<br />
<br />It may not sound like a big deal, but I believe that you'll agree that 3 wall colors in one scene is much better than 2. And yes, that adds significant complexity. The colors might have to share an attribute column with another color, and for all possibilities I have to select the correct palette and use the correct patterns while rendering. A table helps me with this.
<br />
<br />You'll understand when you use the PPU viewer in FCEUXD. Watching the palettes changing as different walls are found is pretty cool. This happens because even though only 3 walls can share the same scene, these colors are dynamic, so you can have as many as you want in a level, as long as no more than 3 of them meet in the same view.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the hosting offers, I guess it make sense to take Memblers' offer, since we were thinking of including a version of the raycaster in his garage cart.

Instead of the big power pellet, have the stars that makes him invincible and allows him to kill them by touch. Maybe put in power ups scattered through out the maze like the flower that allows him 2 shoot fire balls.
