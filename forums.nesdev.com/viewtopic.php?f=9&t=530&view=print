<br />More difficult to design, more difficult to replicate, or more difficult to use? Compare the SuperCard SD for Game Boy Advance, which has a small boot ROM, 32 MB of RAM, and an SD card slot using SPI. It then loads game code from the SD card into RAM. Such a design wouldn't be significantly more difficult than the Famicom Disk System, except possibly for FAT parsing.
<br />
<br />Here's yet another cart design proposal. Is it feasible?

<br />Yeah, it sounds do-able.  It also would need 3V power for the SD card.  Supporting a non-custom file system is the harder part.  
<br />
<br />I'd like to add an SD card to Squeedo sometime, controlled by the PIC.  But I'll have to do that later.
<br />
<br />Here's a cart that uses one:

<br />FAT isn't that hard to parse, given that it was first developed in 1981. It appears that the <a href="http://mypage.direct.ca/c/ccovell/nesdev.html" class="postlink">Doctor PC Jr</a> uses FAT on its floppy disks. So if the Doctor PC Jr supports it, the SD-UNRAM BIOS can support it as well, right?

It wastes power, makes more heat and there is a possibility that the zener will short out and burn up whatever it is your powering. Some semiconductor manufacturer did a study on zeners, and found that 99% of the time they short out, not go open.
<br />
<br />I've seen 3.3V regulators for pretty cheap these days.

<br />How much current do those SD cards need?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I looked at the datasheet for a SanDisk RS-MMC card (which uses the same SPI protocol that you'll be using for the MMC/SD card port), and it gives the following specifications:
<br /><ul><li>2.7V to 3.6V </li><li>0.15 mA idle </li><li>50 mA reading </li><li>60 mA writing </li></ul> Then I looked at the <a href="http://www.sandisk.com/pdf/oem/SD_Physical_specsv101.pdf" class="postlink">simplified SD Card physical layer specs</a>, which should give a <em>maximum</em> current that a card is allowed to draw. Some of the other <a href="http://www.sandisk.com/oem/manuals.asp" class="postlink">SD specs on SanDisk's site</a> seem to give a 100 mA maximum power draw. Would it be too hard to make 200 mA available to the port for a safe margin of error?
<br />
<br />Yes, there are four bank select bits in $5xx0 because this design emulates UOROM. Some 128 KB games will need to be copied into both banks 0-7 and 8-15.
<br />
<br />I specified $5xx1 for generality. Chip select on SD cards is active low (1: not selected; 0: selected), but other SPI peripherals may assume the opposite. Some SPI devices may also assume the inverse direction for the clock signal from what SD assumes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was under the impression that SD is easier to interface with than CF.  SD can provide a more direct interface, while CF uses the IDE interface.  CF has up to 4GB capacities, but up to 2GB in size, both SD and CF are equally priced.  SD has the size advantage, and I am pretty sure it uses less power than CF.  A flash kit based around PSRAM and SD flash cards seems like the ideal route for classic consoles, in my opinion.
<br />
<br />Builtin flash requires some means of programming the chips.  Parallel port is not very user friendly these days, and USB ports add a layer of complexity that negates any simplicity gained by being able to access flash chips in real time.  Then there is the cost and capacity limitations, all taken together it makes SD flash cards plus PSRAM seem like the best choice.
<br />
<br />One might also say that write limitations also make removable flash cards more appealing because once the write limit is reached, you can easily get a new SD flash card... but I am not sure if people actually regularly reach the write limit of their flash devices.  Have people with GBC, GBA, or other flash based backup devices ever reached the write limit of their flash chips?  I could see it happening for developers, but for casual game playing, I just don't see it happening.

I don't know about SD, but modern CF cards store the FAT partition as just a file inside a wear-leveled file system.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Have people with GBC, GBA, or other flash based backup devices ever reached the write limit of their flash chips?</div>
<br />Even the cheapest flash chips offer 10,000 guaranteed erases.
<br />
<br />If we go with a common NES mapper (in this case UOROM clone) on a CF or SD devcart, I'd suggest using iNES files so that 1. you don't have to parse UNIF on a 6502 and 2. the devcart and PocketNES (GBA NES emulator) can use the same files.
<br />
<br />As for powering the CF card, a CF card using flash memory won't use more than 100mA anyway, and <a href="http://www.compactflash.org/info/cfinfo.htm" class="postlink">CF is 5.0V tolerant</a>. As for size, as long as I can plug the CF card in and out of the NES without removing the devcart, it should be OK. I've compared against my frontloader, and it may be possible to design a connector that matches this.
