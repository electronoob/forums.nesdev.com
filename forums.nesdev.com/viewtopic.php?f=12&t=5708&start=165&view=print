<br />
<br />ALL my (E) roms have been patched with ucon64 -f,  But unfortunately, only a few of them will remove the PAL protection.
<br />
<br />THIS is my favorite pal roms list in order of importance of games that dont work on a NTSC system even after trying to remove the PAl protection: IF YOU CAN GIVE ME THE HEX CODE TO CHANGE FOR SOME OF THEM I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY , only if you have time,  THANKS:
<br />
<br />1. Lucky Luke
<br />2. Tintin au Tibet
<br />3. Adventure of Tintin
<br />4. Spirou
<br />
<br />
<br />OTHERS PROBLEMS:
<br />
<br />- BS ZELDA DONT WORK, and i have 4 different versions. and i have one version made for the real hardware.
<br />
<br />- BS F-ZERO 2  DONT WORK
<br />
<br />- Final Fantasy II ( translated in French) only show 2 lines in each paragraph, so its not possible to understand the text.  Its bad because my wife dont speak english and she want to play it. Dont worry the english translation of final fantasy IV work perfectly. 
<br />
<br />- Mystick ARK (7th saga 2) i have 2 roms with a different english patch. anyway the 2 patchs are 100% translated in english. But one of them will SHOW NO TEXT. the other work perfectly.
<br />
<br />- Pilot Wings dont work correctly
<br />
<br />- all A&amp;S nes hack dont work. ex: mappy, pinball, pooyan
<br />
<br />
<br />- I TRIED TO TEST  ALL SNES RPG : USA AND JAPAN AND EURO AND ALL ENGLISH TRANSLATED, ALL OF THEM WORK PERFECTLY, except for what i wrote before.  
<br />
<br />- star ocean need a patch for saving. works perfect with the patch
<br />- terranigma need a patch for working. works perfect with the patch
<br />- all others rpg work without a patch.
<br />
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's likely those translations are from people not testing their hacked code properly.  I haven't tried those ones you mentioned, but I do remember occasionally running into fan translation glitches on my Game Doctor SF7.  Mostly on hacked-in intro screens and such.
<br />
<br />Those A&amp;S NES hacks should work though, they played just fine on the GDSF7.  Maybe PPak doesn't like the small ROM size.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />F-Zero 2 and BS Zelda are probably related problems to loading BS-X roms. They might be fixable with some hex editing or if the PowerPAK loader recognized them in an update I guess. If I ever get a PowerPAK I'd try getting them working. 
<br />
<br />Pilot Wings I remember being a game that even on Copiers needed a patched/hacked version to play or something like that. I can't be sure but I think it is because Pilot Wings is a LoROM DSP-1 where as virtually everything else I'm guessing is HiROM. I know Super Mario Kart, Lock-On (Super Air Diver), and Super Air Diver 2 are all HiROM DSP1 games. I didn't go through the list of every DSP1 game though to see if it is the only one.

<br />
<br />The game is street fighter Alpha 2.  It use the SDD-1 chip.
<br />
<br />If someone decompress Street fighter alpha 2 like someone did for Star OCean, i think street fighter alpha 2 will work with the Snes Powerpak ?
<br />
<br />right ?
<br />
<br />Is it a hard job to do ?
<br />
<br />Another question: 
<br />
<br />i played with a game title: Sonic the hedgehog (UNL) ??
<br />
<br />Is Sega have done a Sonic game for the super nes ?? im very surprised ??
<br />
<br />or its a hack ?
<br />
<br />the game have several stages and several worlds and it work on the snes powerpak
<br />
<br />thanks for answer 
<br />     
<br />
<br />
<br /> (NOTE: I cant pad any hack nes rom. see error : [inSNESt Error] File is smaller than 1 Mbit! ) i tried mappy, anyway i dont miss these games much )
