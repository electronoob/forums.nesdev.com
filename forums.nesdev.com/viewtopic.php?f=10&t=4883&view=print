		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am attempting to play around with writing the VRAM address and tile offsets using $2006. From documentation, it looks like bits 12-14 in the VRAM address are the tile y offset. That means the first time we write to $2006, the upper nibble of the byte is essentially the tile y offset, correct? (with the 15th bit ignored) When I try this out and check out the scrolling with FCEUXD, I am able to increment the tile y offset from 0 to 3, but when I set it to 4, it appears to wrap to 0, as though the 14th bit is being ignored when I write.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is because the first write to $2006 only uses bits 0-5 (high 2 bits are forced to zero).  This makes fully specifying the fine Y scroll impossible with $2006 alone.
<br />
<br />To do this (assuming you can't just use $2005 -- like if you want to change V scroll mid frame or something), you need to alternate $2006 and $2005 writes.  Do the writes in the following order:
<br />
<br />$2006 - write NT scroll (NT scroll in bits 2,3)
<br />$2005 - fine Y scroll
<br />$2005 - fine X scroll
<br />$2006 - write low byte of PPU address (coarse X scroll + 3 bits of coarse Y scroll)

<br />We switch the writes to $2005 since $2006 and $2005 share the toggle for high/low byte.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The thing is that these writes only affect the <em>temporary</em> PPU address (loopy_t) and not the <em>real</em> PPU address (loopy_v).  The only way the real PPU address can be changed is automatically by the PPU at frame start (provided rendering is enabled) -- or on the <em>second</em> $2006 write.  $2005 writes never update the real address.
<br />
<br />This is why the second $2006 write must be the last in the series.  Doing it your way would work for setting the temp address, but the $2005 writes would have no effect on the real PPU address.
<br />
<br />And if you're using $2005 this way, you might as well just ditch $2006 completely and use the NT scroll bits from $2000 instead.

You can use the low 2 bits of $2000 to set the NT scroll, and use $2005 to set the remaining scroll bits normally.  $2000+$2005 do it all... the only thing they don't do is explicitly change loopy_v.
<br />
<br />The only time you need to use $2006 to change the scroll is if you're changing the Y scroll mid-frame (like for a status bar or something -- or if you're turning rendering on late and miss the PPU's automatic v=t)

<br />I guess this serves as one more evidence that loopy's doc just isn't clear enough. A few years back I came here for explanations because I simply couldn't understand his document. I finally did though, with a little help.
<br />
<br />If someone decides to present that information in a more friendly way (with a wiki entry maybe, instead of just a link to the original doc), they should also make clear that tricky $2005/$2006 writes are only necessary for messing with the scroll *after* the start of the frame. Many people seem to think that using $2006 for scrolling is required, while $2000 and $2005 were designed for manipulating the scroll under normal circunstances (during VBlank).

<br />
<br />I think that's kind of an understatement. It's not really as unclear as much as it's like a riddle or something. Basically the document gives you obscure clues or hints rather than answers.
<br />
<br />I still have to go through this thread to fully understand the relationship between $2005/$2006 for changing the scroll mid frame. But I can already tell just by skimming through it that it's a nicely condensed explanation of this.
