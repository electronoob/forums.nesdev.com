Then I will need to figure out why you mml doesn't work with the latest version (maybe ~J-@D!~ can help me on this issue since he must know the format well). Maybe a few thing changed in the format.

<br />
<br />Thanks for the offer, I appreciate it. It just that I don't know what my ISP allows since all the rules are written in japanese.  Since it's for personal use website, I don't think I can put too much files on it.  I could have used the wiki account but this is for the wiki and I don't want to abuse Koitsu's good will since I don't pay for the hosting.
<br />
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />@~J-@D!~:  
<br />
<br />I was able to modify the ppmck source code to allow to make nes file for VRC7.  I have a few issues:
<br />
<br />vrc7.mml -&gt; missing file sample.inc
<br />vrc7sound2.mml -&gt; missing file psybass.inc
<br />
<br />I tried to make a mutli song nes file but it always fail. I will check on the net to see if I can find any information about it. if you know the cause of failure in that case, please let me know.  I should be able to test melody, instrum and vrcvii tonight.

<br />Sound the same as emulator at first glance.

<br />Same here. 
<br />
<br />I didn't have a chance to check with earphones to hear how different they are but I guess that they are the same.  The PPMCK v0.9 driver doesn't make any glitch on the hardware too, which is a relief.
<br />
<br />As for VRCVII.mml, for some reason, the file failed.  My guess it must be related to some bank setting error. I will try to fix it and post the results later.
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://membler-industries.com/banshaku/j-vrcvii.mp3" class="postlink">vrcvii</a>:
<br />This one seems similar too.
<br />
<br />~J-@D!~:  once I have the 2 missing files that I mentioned in a previous message, I should be able to test the 2 remaining song.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've expected these songs to sound correct, because they use the user-defined patch, which is usually well done on emulator/NSF players. The problem is the predefined patches.
<br />
<br />And those song you're not able to compile: you have the MML file, but not the DMC files (defined in those included files .inc) that must come with it... SO, you can just delete the lines containing "#include .....", @DPCM = ... , and anything about the E channel (so when a line begins with 'E', delete it)
<br />
<br />or I can take a shovel and dig in my computer to find these files, and you'll have to change paths in the MML file and maybe the INC file too. Tell me if you prefer this

<br />Either way is fine with me.  I didn't know I could remove those lines since I didn't know the use of it.  So if you don't mind without dmc I will test it tonight.

<br />
<br />BTW, I noticed MML has been around in BASIC programming for a long time (the PLAY command).  And that there's MML in text format (editable, too) in the game Castle Excellent.

<br />Well now I know what I can work on after I finish my current project.. fixing the synth that was really never broken!  The thing was making every sound I wanted it to, it just didn't play music properly.  It's a 4 channel (more or less channels for better samplerate) wavetable synth. What's cool is I was putting in some code to morph the waveforms various (controllable) and sometimes chaotic ways.  The waves are 256 bytes, check out how smooth <a href="http://www.parodius.com/~memblers/nes/squeedo/samps/004.mp3" class="postlink">this pulse-width sweep</a> is (not quite SID-level, but pretty good).  But anyways the part I was proud of was that it all worked on an unmodified NES (using a sound IRQ with the $4011 register).  So I think it's still the first (only?) sound expansion for the NES.  Doing it now I would try to use the expansion pin (also making it Famicom sound compatible) and offer the IRQ as an option.

That's why I'm using a tracker since I can hear in real time the note I'm trying to write and can tweak it right after. It takes more time to make music that way thought.

<br />
<br />Exactly. Changing the channels isn't enough, the VRCVII has only one user-defined instrument (as you already know), so I can only mimic one of the waveforms you made. Substituing some of your N106 samples with standart VRCVII patches?
