I'm all for the "let's dump everything we know" idea. There is a great deal of information discovered since the most famous/detailed docs were written, and the current wiki is too vague when it comes to this kind of new information. I'm not very good at planning things, but I will contribute to as many sections as I can.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jun 10, 2009 9:19 pm</p><hr />

If we wait for perfect the format, the perfect design.. It will never happen. Nothing is perfect.<br /><br />Since the original wiki is down a few time and the content doesn't have any real license, I think we should re-use most of the content and try to organize it at the same time, if time allows it.  Already having the main sections copied to it would be already useful when the "main" server is failing.   I asked to make a mirror but I never got an answer for that so the only way to make one will be to do it by hand.<br /><br />If some people have some objection to copying then they can raise it but I would be surprised. The goal of this wiki is to have some resource for the community so as long as the content is available, people will be more than happy with it.  Copying the content will just make sure that we have a backup of it. That's how I see it.<br /><br />Any objection?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Tue Jun 09, 2009 5:01 am</p><hr />

Yeah. It's the itch that doesn't want to go!... I asked Atarimike already.  They changed a port on the firewall so we lost access to the server. Should be fixed tomorow. I'm happy that I have a local copy (kind of) of the site.<br /><br />Maybe I should make one someday for everyone or just copy the site "without permission" on parodius since the new wiki idea doesn't seems to move forward anyway.  It always fail when I check content.
