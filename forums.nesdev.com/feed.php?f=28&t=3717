OK, I did the mod and it worked fine. I just connected the /CE of the WRAM chip to GND. I tried it with Dragon Warrior IV, which ran just fine. I took some pics. First, the front of the cart:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/devcartfront.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The back of it:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/devcartback.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The game running:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/devcartgame.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />My box of devcarts is growing! =)<br /><br /><img src="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/devcartbox.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Although the game worked, I don't know if it used the special switching thing up to the point I played. I should probably debug the game in an emulator to verify that.<br /><br />EDIT: Yeah, the game seems to switch a lot between the 2 256KB ROM banks right from the start. I can now safely say that the cart works.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Nov 20, 2007 5:16 pm</p><hr />

Battery is always optionnal. I haven't seen a single official Nintendo board that doesn't have solder pads to make it work without one (at least not on all scans on Bootgod's site), expet maybe for 3rd party board (such as the one used in Overlord).<br /><br />I trought the pin 11 of MMC1 was called CHR A16 / WRAM /CE because it is the /CE of the WRAM on SOROM board (because this bit selects between two RAM chips), but maybe this is wrong, because this should be CHR A15 (I have no SOROM board to verify). The WRAM is normally enabled only by CE (pin 6), and the negative chip enable is unused (so I guess it's grounded). Maybe that's not the case on SNROM, tough, I haven't checked. If so setting this bit will disable SRAM, wich is weird. Maybe only older or newer board have this ? Because on SKROM, you just KNOW this bit can only be used to bankswitch the CHRROM, but things may be different on SAROM, SJROM (smaller CHR sizes), and SNROM (CHR RAM). I think the inverted /CE is used to chose the active RAM chip on SOROM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Nov 20, 2007 12:16 pm</p><hr />

Hey guys, turns out that the pin referent to CHR A16 on the MMC1 is connected to WRAM /CE. Can you tell me if I can just undo this connection and use it for PRG A18? Or is the MMC1 providing this /CE to the WRAM chip? I'm lost with this one, can anyone help me out?<br /><br />EDIT: I'm finding very weird the fact that this pin is connected to WRAM /CE. Does that mean you can enable or disable the WRAM chip using the bit that would otherwise be CHR A16? I have never heard of this, because the MMC1 has other means of enabling and disabling WRAM, right? And if I do cut this connection and connect the pin to PRG A18, what should I do about the WRAM /CE? Connect it to GND?<br /><br />EDIT 2: Can a mod split this thread? We've been talking about the MMC1 for a while... so the title could be something like "Converting SNROM board into SUROM".

- You said you hate the MMC1, but it's just a slightly enhanced UNROM like mapper if you look it that way. If you managed to avoid bus conflicts on UOROM, I don't see why you couldn't just make 5 switches to writes to the mapper. Just make a routine that does this for you (like you probably already did to avoid bus conflicts on UOROM) so this really is simple. The only difference is that you will have to manage more registers. Yes, 4KB bankswitching is poor (depending on the usage) but it doesn't matter if you use CHRRAM. Just write $0e/$0f (UxROM mode) to the control register and $00 to both CHR bankswitching registers at reset and you're done. In the case of SUROM, you'll want to bankswitch the main 2 sides of the ROM with the first CHR bankswitching register. The NESdev wiki says all there is to say about it.<br /><br />- It's not hard to make a 512 kB mapper 2 ROM run in any emulator. However, what is hard, is to reproduce it in hardware, you'll need one more '161 and one more '32 in order to make it work. You certainly cannot do this by simply modifying a existing UNROM board.<br /><br />- While only DW3 and DW4 uses SUROM in the United States (and a couple of more games in japan), any SNROM board can be converted to SUROM by changing ONE wire, wich is less than the number of wires you should change to make a SNROM board accept regular EPROMs. Just tie A18 to CHR A16 (the pin is originally on PRG R/W for some reason, SNROM have 2 pins connected to it). I guess Nintendo could have mande only SUROM boards and used them for all SNROM games as well, but for some reason they did just not do that.<br /><br />- I don't know if you will be able to sell repros if your game is labelled Sonic, so I don't think you will want to avoid MMC3 just for that.

You should be able to take the SNROM board, reroute the unused CHR A16 to the PRG A18.  A18 is likely tied to gnd on the pcb so you can bend that pin up or cut the trace.

OK, guys... I'm considering the SUROM idea... It's possible to make new boards with your parts, right bunnyboy? I don't have to use the battery, right?<br /><br />Now just answer me something about SUROM: It uses the highest CHR address line (since it's not used for CHR) to control the highest PRG address line, right? With that you select which 256KB half of the 512KB chip you see, right? That's not perfect, but could work for my game. One of the 256KB halves could contain mostly graphics, and maybe music.<br /><br />If I'm gonna use it, I'd like to have a devcart... Is there any other more common MMC1 cart that could be transformed into SUROM, minus the battery? Can anyone list games that use the SUROM board (or boards that could possibly be turned into SUROM)? The "boardtable.txt" file doesn't seem to list any...<br /><br />From what I've seen, SJROM and SNROM seem close enough to what I want, I'd just have to do the 512KB trick. I thinkI *might* have a SNROM at home. I'll check next time I go there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Nov 18, 2007 6:49 pm</p><hr />
