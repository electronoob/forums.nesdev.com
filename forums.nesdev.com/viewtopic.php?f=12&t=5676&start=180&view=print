		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your problem reminds my of one of my software professors whose freshman C++ labs basically consist of being given broken code that you have to fix (usually simple logic and syntax errors), then once you check it off, he or his TA's get to break it again.  One of his favorite dirty tricks is to replace a single space with an invalid, non-printable character that renders as a space in the IDE.  The man is diabolical, but he's an awesome teacher (if you can survive his class...).
