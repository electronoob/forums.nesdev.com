That means re-taking scenes many times when the actors mess up or whatever, using computers and stop-motion filming to get really intricate sequences, etc. One difference is that a TAS may not do anything beyond what can be done by sending the game a sequence of button presses as a controller could generate, otherwise it really is just a movie rather than an intricate puzzle.

This is not a speedrun.
<br />
<br />Altough there is good tool asisted speedruns, like I remember one who did Castlevania : Circle of the moon in slightly more than 20 minutes which was awesome it was very weird and turned into a skeleton to kill all bosses in one hit.
<br />
<br />So while some TAS sucks, some others can be great. With regular speedruns you are sure that they are fair and even more impressive. But tool asisted stuff can be more fun at times.
<br />
<br />Also it is wrong to say that tool assisted speedruns are always clearly labeled at such. I have seen many speedruns on Youtube that were not labeled as tool assisted, but that seems to have been done with other cheats than just savestates.

<br />
<br />That was the most disappointing speedrun, tool-assisted or no, that I've ever seen. (For me to enjoy it, it is important that they not cheat luck too much -- killing every single boss via possibly multiple critical bones made it completely implausible that someone might have done that. OTOH, the Metroid speedrun where they kill enemies frame-perfect to get the desired loot was psychologically ok.)

<br />I don't hate TAS, I just don't wouldn't want to make it easier than necessary (as if someone would bother to speedrun anything I've written, let alone even play it twice). Part of the fun of a TAS (I assume) is the challenge.
