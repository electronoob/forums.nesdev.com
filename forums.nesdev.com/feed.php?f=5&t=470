Hey, I'm really disapointed. I've written a huge sound engine, taking myself a couple of week of work, and I'm unable to play it with your player !! I do nothing tricky, no bankswitching !<br />I just write to the registers using indexed indirect mode (lda [blah],Y) but that should be supported, I even changed it to write to the registers the normal way, and if still doesn't work. I'm hugly disappointed. Why wouldn't it work ? That's really stupid.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Nov 05, 2005 1:22 pm</p><hr />

Well, the SNES is far to be powerfull enough to emulate the NES (I think). It has a similar, but faster CPU, but a very different PPU and even more different APU. The SNES nsf player is extremely cool, but it doesn't sound like the NES unless you remove the "sampling interpolation" in the sound options of ZSNES.<br />Yeah, the SNES could run the code of a NES game fine, but what about the PPU writes and the APU writes ? It would write only in the SNES RAM, nothing else.<br />And about emulating it, it would me by far too much slower, and pretty crazy to have a processor emulating itself.<br /><br />I never owned any Sega console, so I don't know how this compability had worked.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Aug 14, 2005 10:13 am</p><hr />

Well, all nsf I have are witout sound effects. Playing them over the music would be even more cool !<br />By meaning Win32 version, I would mean witout have to uses ZSNES. Well, ZSNES is more or less to the SNES what Nesticle is to the NES.<br />The real problem is that it can't play any NSF that have a size over 32kb, or that have any kind of bankswitching. It's a shame that it doesn't play the majority of nsf out there  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /> <br />Only the music from old games, and only few new games works. I really tried to modify the Just Breed's nsf to reduce its size to 32kb (with only some of the songs in it at the same time), and to remove any kind of banksithing, but even if it plays fine in any other NSF player, it doesn't work with the SNES nsf player (even if it would, all MMC5 channels would be lost, heh...). Even to play simple songs, the fact to have to modify your nsf file to fill a whole 32kb file, then to have to save it under a SRM file, that would overwrite the previous one, is frustrating. Imagine the same, where you simply have to load the nsf file you want, that would be so great !<br />Also, Solar Jetman sometimes play wrong notes, and sometimes when the sweeps are used, the visualisation get suck.<br />What's Cubic player ?<br />About porting it on the nes, it would be pretty easy, without bankswitching. You just have to copy all the code, and replace all opcode writing to any sound registers by jsr (both are 3 bytes) and eventually go into a routine that effectively write to it, but also write copy of its in some RAM to do the visual effects.<br />The SPC is a great sound chip, but effectively, nothing can easily the sound that the NES does.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:25 am</p><hr />
