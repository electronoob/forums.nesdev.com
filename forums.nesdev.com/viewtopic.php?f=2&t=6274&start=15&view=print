<br />
<br />I remember writing software in basic pds that'd convert bitmaps into nes tile format (of course that was a over a decade ago on my pentium 75MHz laptop, so it's long gone.)
<br />
<br />Not too sure about how you'd achieve NES emulation...I'm certain that the WinCE machine could run somthing made for WinCE on it's architecture though.&lt;/my2cents&gt;

Non-linear (segmented) memory models on original x86 really sucked -- there's all sorts of complexities you never think of until you actually run into them.  Have you actually tried using XMS and EMS?  They suck -- XMS is easier to use, but there's added complexities with it.  And ;et's not forget that 640KBytes is enough for anyone... *sigh*
<br />
<br />Otherwise, if the OP is at least willing to go 386, he can generate a DOS MZ binary (16-bit) which then makes use of something called a "DOS extender" (which transparently provides setup and functions for full 32-bit protected mode) -- like DOS32 or DOS4GW.  I'm familiar with DOS32.  Trust me, it's easy to use and it's a blessing.

<br />A 16-bit program runs in the available PC emulators that run on old-skool smartbooks from before Windows CE was called Windows Mobile. A 32-bit program does not. So the choices are to write native NES development tools for Windows CE or write a 386 PC emulator for Windows CE; both are highly complicated projects.

<br />
<br />If the form factor is the reason behind keeping it, you could go for something <a href="http://www.jp.onkyo.com/pc/notebook/bx407/index.htm" class="postlink">like this</a>.  The only problem is the price.. They don't give them. Very small thought. I tried at one store on the way back to work. It came out recently.  WinXP, 512meg ram, atom z515, 32 gig ssd, touch screen.  I wouldn't mind having one for the (literally) "crush" on the morning train.

It's not a laptop only because it would break your lap, heheh.  It has a 286, 640kB of RAM, VGA monochrome LCD, 3.5" floppy, dead internal HD, it's pretty nice.  I don't think I'll be using it anytime soon for development though.  QBASIC worked fine on it, I was going to to try CopyNES on it one time, but it couldn't be arsed to boot.  16-bit PCs are dead, heheh.
