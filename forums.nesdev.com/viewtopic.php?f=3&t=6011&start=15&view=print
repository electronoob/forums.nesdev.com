<br />Anyway, now I set everything to FF (including PPU/APU registers) on startup.
<br />I've also started testing some roms(Super mario bros, ice climber, donkey kong) to see if everything works good so far.
<br />It does not! :p
<br />Only donkey kong gives me the correct graphical output. Ice climber is just blank, and I don't know why.
<br />I wonder if anyone might have an idea of whats wrong.
<br />I've not implemented sound or input support yet if that could have something to do with it?

<br />About the PPU it has it's "warm up time" where it's entierely disabled and only $2002.7 reads are known to be reliable, but I don't know any details. That's why most programms write $00 to $2000/$2001 to turn the graphic output off, wait 2 or 3 frames by polling $2002.7, and write $00 to $2000/$2001 again to make sure the PPU is effectively disabled, because on power on the first writes might as well not have any effect.
<br />
<br />The vast majority of programms should work without the sound being emulated, but a few will rely on DMC IRQs (Guardian Legend, ...) or APU IRQs (Door Door, Dragon Quest, ...) in order to work.

Your best bet is to log every executed instruction to a file, then run the game in FCEUXD for example (which can log to file as well) and compare both outputs to see where your emulator went wrong.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I've not implemented sound or input support yet if that could have something to do with it?</div>

<br />Well, if you like to use it for playing, that's your call, but please never use it for development purposes (like comparing your emulator to it).
<br />
<br />FCEU isn't terribly accurate either. It's great because it originated debugging versions that are insanely useful, but it doesn't do a great job out of simulating several obscure details of the console.
<br />
<br />The consensus is that Nestopia and Nintendulator are the most accurate emulators, so you should always use those for development purposes. But having an actual console to run tests on is a good idea too. I have programmed stuff that these two emulators were fine with, but they looked wrong on the actual console.

<br />In my most recent situation I had mostly the same problem you had with LJ65 because you turned sprites off early. I was disabling and enabling sprite rendering mid-frame and this caused sprites to look corrupted. I don't know if that behavior has been completely understood by now...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From the small experience I've had, the Linux version of FCEU also sucks as opposed to its Windows counterpart. It had no graphics filters available, was lagging even tough my PC is largely powerful enough to accurately emulate the NES, and I didn't even see debugging options. It might have been me tough.
<br />I think there was 2 NES emus I found on Linux so I may be confusing with the other one - I'd have to check that again.
<br />
<br />Tokumaru, in case you don't want to Switch to Linux you can do like me : Install Windows, install Linux on the top of it, and modify the boot parameters so that Windows is selected by default. Be careful tough not to mess up with your drives, which is a very easy thing to do.

<br />
<br />I experienced the same as you. My notebook is powerful enough to run NES emulators with filters and debugging windows without any sort of lag, but when I tried what was available for Linux it was all very slow and unstable.

<br />There are some other bugs left though and I have some more questions :p.
<br />
<br />1. Should the top row(the one not visible on ntsc displays) contain garbage(sprites) in donkey kong?
<br />
<br />2. Any idea why the hud in SMB is flickering? Could it be a timing related problem or something else?
