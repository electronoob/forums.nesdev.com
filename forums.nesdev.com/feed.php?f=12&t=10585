I made some interesting discoveries. <br /><br />First, I did try removing the pull down resistors on the SNES audio input side, they are 200 ohms to ground actually. <br /><br />It then tried both the Adapter and the super gameboy and it was not as bad as we expected I guess. Removing those pull down resistors really seems like it makes a bass boost + volume boost. I even kinda liked it with the Super game boy, I mean, Tetris Bass boost was sort of a refreshing novelty.  <br /><br />With the AD adapter, bass was equally boosted, maybe a bit too much. <br /><br />I then tried with 1000 ohm pull downs and it felt about right.  It was cool with Super game boy, sounding more badass than usual. With Ad adapter though, it was still a bit thin, because they count as 500 ohm instead of 1000. And The adapter is not designed for that to begin with.  I think its designed to for straight output.<br /><br />But that is not all, I then opened the AD adapter and tested every parts on the AD adapter to find where the hidden audio trace was going and I found it. <br />It goes to a pair of caps, where it then splits to two traces that seem to bury under the glob top. ( STEREO ?! ) <br />Those caps are C28 and C29.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JATA9mqh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I was ultra excited that maybe this thing had stereo after all. I removed the caps and soldered the pads to a temporary RCA outoput and tried it. <br />They are definitely two separate channels it would seem, one has more noise than the other for some reason. But they still output the same waveform, I checked. <br /><br />It seems like they actually intended stereo with the adapter. But possibly they had some issues and they deactivated it. Maybe it can be reactivated with a pin... <br />There are several empty part spots on the board; resistors, transistors, caps. I wonder what else this adapter could be hiding. <br /><br />This is the version 1.0 board. Maybe the Super Retro Adapter is a better version? I am tempted to get one... But I am risking getting the same board twice... There are no reviews of PCB pictures of it yet and it annoys me...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6214">MaxWar</a> — Tue Oct 15, 2013 11:24 pm</p><hr />

I tried my idea of putting a switch on the base of the Transistor ( IT was Q13 and not Q15 on my board revision ) <br /><br />It works well, the sound of the AD adapter gets mixed in but it still sounds bad. Maybe its a little better than default sound out of the adapter on a SNES, but not as good as when the sound output is completely isolated from the SNES.

Ideally, you should have a little piece of software that the SNES uploads to the SPC700 that will disable the mute.<br />There's probably enough information at wiki.superfamicom.org to piece that together:<br /><a href="http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/SPC700+Reference" class="postlink">SPC 700 Reference</a>, <a href="http://wiki.superfamicom.org/snes/show/Transferring+Data+from+ROM+to+the+SNES+APU" class="postlink">Transferring Data from ROM to the SNES APU</a><br /><br />Oh, and in the case you've circled, the transistor is just serving as an inverter. (You could also think of it as a common-emitter amplifier, but when the input is digital, that's a bit misleading)<br /><br />When MUTE is asserted, the second and third transistor (Q14, Q15) short out the adjacent resistor and reduce the gain of the adjacent opamp.<br /><br />If you really want to break your SNES to make this work, the cleanest thing would be to desolder R49. But be careful; that part may have moved or changed number between revisions of the SNES, I don't know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Mon Oct 14, 2013 9:47 pm</p><hr />

First of all, a big Thanks for the replies!! You guys are a great help. <br />This schematic rewrite is also great, A big improvement over those barely readable originals. <br /><br /><br />I checked the /MUTE pin of the DSP and it is indeed High during normal operation but it is low when the AD adapter is used. <br /><br />I am trying to figure the best way to switch it high when Im using the AD adapter.  I do not think I can just force it high, it would probably just short the system. <br />Here is the concerned part of the schematic: (/MUTE at the transistor base connects to the DSP ) <br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vuWM0un.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I am not any kind of electronic engineer so I am not familiar with this specific type transistor usage. <br />I am familiar with transistors as common collector AMPS and switches, but with the switched device connected to either C or E. There its connected to Base and I do not understand how it works yet. <br /><br />I could always cut the Mute line right at the pin and switch it but there must be a nerdier/cooler/better way of doing this. Any ideas?<br /><br />(EDIT, I just realized that there is 33k resistor between the base and the pin, so I guess I could try to force it high, but then would not the 4.3k pull up resistor force it high all the time since since its much bigger then the 33k?? What kind of sorcery is this!)<br /><br />EDIT 2, I measured resistance between pin 39 of the DSP and ground and +5v, gets in the MegaOhm range with both. That does not add up with the Schematic. Maybe my SNES revision is different, Its a GPM-02 .<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6214">MaxWar</a> — Mon Oct 14, 2013 9:36 pm</p><hr />
