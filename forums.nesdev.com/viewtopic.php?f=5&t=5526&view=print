I'm pretty sure other people here burn to ask them too. Of course I can understand it's hard to impossible to remember exact details that much time later.
<br />
<br />- What kind of computer did you use to do NES-dev ? Did the compile process take long ?
<br />
<br />- What kind of tools did you have to make graphics ?
<br />
<br />- What kind of cardige hardware did you use to test your code in the console ? It looks all Eurocom's games uses the MMC3, were you only able to use a MMC3 cartridge ? Because you mentionned all the financial prolems Eurocom had, why didn't Eurocom try to save costs by having games running on simpler hardware like Rare did ?
<br />
<br />Feel free to answer either here or on your blog. Other people feel free to add questions to the list (but not too much or that may turn him down).

I imagine there was a lot of working off of the computer, and then entering data by hand. But I could be wrong. Perhaps there were editors of some sort made on the NES itself? I've used this idea MANY times.

<br />
<br />I remember reading an interview with a developer from Color Dreams, where he said the graphics editor they used at first ran on NES, and was used with a controller.  Then later they made the NinDraw utility for PC.
<br />
<br />I wrote part of a metatile-based level editor on NES too.

The reason I stress -today- is because a NES emulator saves the SRAM data in an 8k file that you can easily work with and edit. Back then, I'm not so sure this would be so efficient as it might be difficult to retrieve the SRAM data from the chip on the cart. But I haven't worked with really old computers, so I can't say much about it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I've seen a video of Atari 2600 programmers working like that...

<br />
<br />Yeah, a programming professor told me that he often had to write programs by hand on paper when he first started programming. That's not nearly as nightmarish as the whole punch-card deal! I can't imagine having to wait a number of days to find out if your program worked or not... Actually when I've been on vacation without a laptop or anything, I've written several programs by hand. They were mostly little routines rather than large scale programs though.

<br />
<br />But with today's ease of tools like vb.net or even vb6 (or any flavor flavor of rad tool like delphi etc),  it will be a lot easier to make a simple editor and, the most important,  <strong>debug</strong> it later.  On the nes, making the same thing will be longer to code and will be always primitive since you're limited by the hardware and the controller for the input interface.
<br />
<br />Back in the days I could understand to do it on the nes and have a way to read your save ram but now I don't find it acceptable at all.

It must be pretty cool to draw level maps by shooting at metatiles! =) On an emulator, where you can use the mouse as a gun, it could be very comfortable (except for the white flashes resulting from each click). There wouldn't be any dragging, but clicking can already do a lot!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Back in the days I could understand to do it on the nes and have a way to read your save ram but now I don't find it acceptable at all.</div>
<br />I think the idea has it's merits. Say, 20 years from now, if you are making a NES game, you certainly have a NES, an emulator, or other means of running NES programs. Can you be sure you'll be able to run .NET applications, for example? Or that the graphics library you use in your C program has a working version for the OSs of the time?
<br />
<br />Also, depending on the tool, much of the code can be shared between it and the game. A level editor could use the same rendering engine as the game, while an editor in a different platform would need to have it's own version of the rendering engine.

<br />
<br />For those of us who already know how to program for the NES, it might take less time to make a NES-based level editor than it does to learn everything you'd need to know to make one in Visual Basic. I was planning on making one in VB, and I was going through all these tutorials and whatnot, and then after like 2-3 weeks, I said "Screw it", and whipped up a NES-based one in like 2 days. That includes a metatile editor as well as a level editor. And like tokumaru said, you can use the same rendering code that you do for your game rather than typing it again (and since it's not the NES, you'll have to define the concept of tiles and attributes, which could be a pain).

<br />
<br />@Celius:
<br />
<br />I guess it all goes to which platform/programming language you have more experience in the end.  I didn't meant that it's wrong, maybe I sounded hard in the way I said it.  With my current background, it make little sense to make an editor on the nes since I know I can make more with the current tools I know.  Since most of your experience is on the nes, it makes perfect sense to make the tool on that platform directly.
<br />
<br />@Tokumaru:
<br />
<br />As for tool that cannot be used in the future, so the same thing can happens with emulators and other things.  Any tools/software can be an issue in the future to use again. But with the proper emulators (dosbox, virtual pc) or emulation layers (wow64 etc), it should still be possible.  Some of the code could be ported to the next platform too. 
<br />
<br />Don't forget that technology always progress and more will be possible in the future. With the nes, we already knows it's limit and once you reach it, your editor will have to endure it.  Who knows what kind of editor we will be able to do in the future is the proper tools exit.
<br />
<br />Now let's go back to the original topic. I want to know too how it was "back in the days" from someone that saw it from it's own eyes. That will be an interesting read <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />For programming we had Amstrad PCs (similar to Amstrad PC1512);
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.sticklandweb.co.uk/images/AmstradPC1512.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />We originally started with a modified version of PDS which used a comms card in the PC (excuse my general ignorance of this, I'm not technically-minded with regard to this stuff) which was connected via a parallel-port type connector &amp; cable to DIY flash ROM (or RAM?) cards that slotted into the cart slot on the Famicom. With PDS you'd assemble the code to a binary file which would then be dumped to the flash cart. Later on, we re-wrote PDS from scratch to make it more powerful and add in some specific console development features (things like adding support for the SNES's processors etc.) and it ended up being nicknamed "EDS" (Eurocom Development System - original huh? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />For those unfamiliar with the PDS system (I think it was originally made for C64?) it was a kind-of IDE is so much that it was a single (DOS) application that included a text editor, macro assembler &amp; disassembler. You could also use it (well our own "EDS" version at least, not sure about the original PDS) as a command-line assembler.
<br />
<br />As you can imagine, on cheap PC's from the late 1980s, assembling code was a slow, slow process <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />For graphics, I'm pretty sure we used DPaint Anim on Atari STs. Maybe someone can help there with the chronology/platform-availability. It was definitely on Atari STs though. We had several tools (written in Basic I think) to convert bitmaps into tiles etc.
<br />
<br />As for assembling graphics into backgrounds/maps, I have a feeling this might have been done in DPaint too. There was definitely the use of a joystick involved to lay down the tiles (again on the Atari ST). Again, several command-line tools to wrestle the data into a format for the NES.
<br />
<br />We definitely didn't have anything that ran natively on the NES.
<br />
<br />I don't think every NES game we did was MMC3 was it? In any case, it was irrelevant to us as that was just a publisher cost. The development carts were "home made". We had several proper test carts with EPROM sockets on which I would assume came from Nintendo though I've no idea who paid for them. These weren't the source of Eurocom's financial woes though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I'm doing all this from memory - if there's anything more specific you want to know about I'll try to ask some other people who might know more details/have slightly better memory of those days.

<br />Nope. We were sent one by our first publisher, Taxan (Magician), it was 99% Japanese. We spent a day with two Japanese girls (studying English I think) at a local university and they helped us decipher some of it. The rest we figured out by trial-and-error.

<br />I fear it may have been shredded/burned years ago. You've just reminded me to ask around at the office though - someone else asked me the same question a while back and I totally forgot.
