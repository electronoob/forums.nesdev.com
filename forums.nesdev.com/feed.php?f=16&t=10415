All pages containing use of &lt;source&gt; and &lt;/source&gt; tags, excluding User pages, have been modified to use &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; tags instead.<br /><br />I did most of this by hand, and only later did I find the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Replace_Text" class="postlink">Replace_Text</a> extension for MediaWiki, which helped me find 2 others to fix up.<br /><br />Anyway, because of the nature of all of this, I'm locking this thread.  It would be nice if the syntax highlighter maintainers would actually maintain their software through official MediaWiki channels and so on, but it really doesn't look like that's going to happen.

It will be removed.  I am certain whatever this matter is will become a problem again in the future, and it is difficult to maintain from an administrator's point of view given the manual modifications/file placements/etc. that have to be done.<br /><br />I have edited (by hand) all the pages I previous improved to use the syntax highlighter, but because MediaWiki does not offer what I need, I will need to go through MySQL directly to find any remaining active pages that use the old source tag and fix them.  There have been some added/changed since, so I need to find them to do a thorough/proper cleanup job before I can call it a &quot;done deal&quot;.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Sep 10, 2014 9:24 pm</p><hr />

Eh, that was not the point.

You can search for &quot;thefox&quot; in shCore.js, there are a bunch of replace() lines. If you add &quot;&amp;#160;&quot; -&gt; &quot; &quot; in there, that should take care of the issue. &quot; &quot; should preferably be a non-breaking space, as that's what the HTML entity 160 stands for.<br /><br />Unfortunately this would be, like the other existing replace() lines, just another hack, because all HTML entities are not covered.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Wed Sep 10, 2014 7:07 pm</p><hr />

OK, I think I found the problem. A semicolon was missing on one of the lines (gotta love JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion). The attached file should fix the problem.

So here's the status:<br /><br />1. I've put things into place verbatim, and they do seem to work.  That said:<br /><br />2. I had to Shift-Reload to pick up the .js changes.  I was a little surprised by this, given that the file sizes differ substantially (old vs. new) as well as file timestamps, so I'm not sure what's going on there.  I think MediaWiki does offer some way to force a cache update for clients, but I don't think that'd affect this because its not the MediaWiki page content itself that changed, only the stuff referenced by &lt;script&gt; (the filenames haven't changed, etc.).  That should all be server-side/Apache-side as far as HTTP server vs. client headers go.<br /><br />3. All the packers I tried did in fact break the Javascript as you said.  Some got them down to reasonable sizes (17KBytes), but they'd break with syntax errors / missing semicolon and the like.  As such, I'm going to put in a request to WhoaMan to enable mod_deflate (either for all of Apache or just within the nesdev VirtualHost contexts) to rectify the situation.  It's the best I can do.<br /><br />The reason the file size matters so much is both an issue of wasted network bandwidth and overall speed (it now takes 6x longer to download that single .js file, plus the time it takes to parse it/run it on the client).  76KBytes of JavaScript probably isn't going to make things like tablets (ex. Kindle devices) and other embedded devices very happy.  I'm crossing my fingers though.  If we get complaints, I'm pulling the entire syntax highlighting crap out entirely and will manually go through all the pages and remove the tags (this takes me an hour plus to do).<br /><br />I think it's utterly ridiculous how crappy all these syntax highlighters are.  I keep seeing new ones pop up on the web all over the place on blogs and so on, but god only knows what's going on under the hood there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat Apr 12, 2014 4:58 pm</p><hr />

Okay, this is all extremely complex, with many things that could go wrong any moments, so I have opted not to do this yet.  Let me discuss the situation.<br /><br />1. ALL CHANGES THAT DIFFERENTIATE FROM STOCK SOFTWARE MUST BE DOCUMENTED/PATCHES/DIFFS MADE.  I do this any time I make a change; this responsibility falls on me, but minimising the number of diffs from stock software is important.  Failure to do this results in basically 100% inability for ANY kind of software upgrades to reliably be done.  Rephrased: the more one-offs we have to deal with, the more painful upgrades (of MediaWiki, MW extensions, forum software, whatever) become.  I think Tepples knows bits/pieces of what the situation is, and I know other bits/pieces.<br /><br />At this time we already have one diff for SyntaxHighlighter, and I will explain what it contains (two things):<br /><br />i) Modifies SyntaxHighlighter.php to include &quot;6502&quot; and &quot;asm&quot; SyntaxHighlighter engine references, which refer directly to the engine called &quot;Assembly6502&quot;.<br /><br />ii) Installs a new file, scripts/shBrushAssembly6502.js, which is quite small (1.9KBytes).  Your .zip file contains a replacement that appears to be almost identical to this (but not entirely), but the filename is called shBrush6502.js so I would need to rename it (not a problem).<br /><br />2. The default shCore.js file is 16175 bytes.  The shCore-nesdev.js file in the .zip you uploaded is 72517 bytes.  This is enormous for Javascript, by the way.  After a review of it, it looks to me like it needs to be packed or what's otherwise known as &quot;minified&quot;.  I have no idea how to pack anything related to Javascript (edit: maybe <a href="http://compressorrater.thruhere.net/" class="postlink">this is helpful</a>), but there's no way we're putting a 72KByte JS file into place.  Minified should be significantly smaller.<br /><br />3. The author of SyntaxHighlighter, on his site last month, <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/" class="postlink">stated that he's working on maintaining the thing once more</a>.  However no where in github does he provide the built versions (and I don't know if they're packed/minified).<br /><br />I won't be changing anything to &quot;include shCore-nesdev.js rather than shCore.js&quot; because that just creates more one-offs.  Instead I'll just have to name the thing shCore.js, once a packed version can be provided.<br /><br />Don't worry about the comments at that Javascript packing site about gzip or webserver compression; that's stuff that has to happen within Apache/on the server side and would require WhoaMan to make changes (it helps substantially).  What I used on Parodius was below (and greatly relied upon mod_mime_magic to help properly detect things too):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LoadModule deflate_module libexec/apache22/mod_deflate.so<br />LoadModule mime_magic_module libexec/apache22/mod_mime_magic.so<br /><br />&lt;IfModule deflate_module&gt;<br />  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain<br />  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html<br />  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css<br />  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/csv<br />  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml<br />  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml<br />  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml<br />  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript<br />  BrowserMatch &quot;^Mozilla/4&quot; gzip-only-text/html<br />  BrowserMatch &quot;^Mozilla/4\.0&#91;678&#93;&quot; no-gzip<br />  BrowserMatch &quot;\bMSIE&quot; !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html<br />&lt;/IfModule&gt;<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat Apr 12, 2014 1:38 am</p><hr />
