<br />
<br />The other ones are nice too. They seems to have a little bit of a mega man feel to it (or maybe I'm thinking too much).  
<br />
<br />I forgot to mention: I guess you tracked them with famitracker since you send the link first on the forum over there? If this is the case, how hard is it to convert it back to your own engine?

<br />
<br />Yes, I originally do stuff with Famitracker as it has playback in realtime and I'm used to reading tracked formats.  To convert it into the music engine is not very hard.  I've basically memorized the note numbers.  I made labels for the effects it can do.  I use the same numbers as I do with Famitracker.  4 = eighth note, 8 = quarter, etc.
<br />
<br />One thing that still throws me is the engine has the octave start at the note A instead of C...  So I sometimes think that C4 is lower pitch than A4, but it's not.  Hehe.

<br />
<br />Ok I see.  I only used tracker before to make music so that's why I like FT.  If there was a way to just extract the data to your own format that would save you even more time I guess.  I don't know if the famitracker source are very friendly or not for that.  Still thinking if I will use the driver or not for my future project. But now I'm going off topic.
<br />
<br />I will go back to topic then. Can't wait to see the rest of the music. The music style feels like previous commercial nintendo game so it really get you in the mood. In my case, I don't consider myself good at music so my current WIP doesn't sound any good to that at all. It sounds maybe ok but not really nintendo like to me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Listened to the complete track.  For now, track 1 and 8 are still the one that stands out (especially the first 1).  After hearing the first track, the other ones feels more bland.   Maybe if I could see how they "fit" in the game then I could have a better feel for them. 
<br />
<br />The game over part is fine.
<br />
<br />Edit: 
<br />
<br />Forgettable seems a little bit too harsh of a comment (I wrote this message too fast I guess). What I meant is after hearing the first song, the other ones doesn't seems as energetic: they feel less catchy.  The soundtrack is still good.

<br />
<br />The progress you've made on this project is awesome.
<br />I loved the videos I've seen, they've been motivating me and probably others to spend more time with nes dev.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I really hope you finish this soon which sounds totally realistic now.

<br />Yeah, it is kinda similar to the beat at the loop point in Magma Man's track, but still different.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />

<br />That is a very high compliment (at least to me.) I guess it all matters what your influence is, mine always comes out sounding like dungeon music.
