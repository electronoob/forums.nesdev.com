<br />
<br />I started a nesdev blog the other day.  Here's an excerpt from the introductory post:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I program the NES as a hobby and Iâ€™m going to post about NES game development here.  I am currently working on a puzzle/labyrinth game.<br /><br />As I code my game, I will write posts detailing my thought process along the way, problems I encounter, solutions I come up with, code snippets, screenshots, gameplay video and whatever else seems appropriate.</div>
<br />
<br />I figured some people here would be interested.  Please check it out!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Maybe people don't want to talk about it because they're not  ready yet to show it.  For example, let say you remake the next Ninja gaiden game and it could look promising but you just started to work on it.  People get all hyped up, pressure get on your back etc. Then, for some reason, you stop to work on it (we all have responsibilities to take care of, kids etc).  Now you feel like you just let down people.
<br />
<br />In that scenario, it feels better to not talk yet about it until you're ready to show something good enough. Maybe some people are in this situation. I may blog someday about what I'm working on. For now, if I blog on it, that steal some of the little time left that I have to work on my project <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />I can see that, definitely. I dunno that I'd want to make a blog yet, myself. The dev log I mentioned has a lot of disjointed brainstorming jargon that probably wouldn't be very readable anyhow; a blog would have to be better written.
<br />
<br />*edit* I participated in a coding scene some years ago which had exactly the problem you mentioned. Tons of people announced large and ambitious projects and screenshots and blog like things and then very few of them got done (none that I can even remember)....not pretty. Maybe being reserved about it like NESDEV is better! Still, doesn't mean a blog isn't a good idea for some...it might help some people out.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the support <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.  It's been a lot of fun writing posts for the blog (I got the itch after writing some wiki articles).  It keeps me thinking about my game too, which has motivated me to code more often actually.  Btw, <a href="http://www.tummaigames.com/blog/2009/07/08/explorer-3-room-data/" class="postlink">wrote up a new post today</a>.

Of course I read about them a lot in these forums, but they are more Q&amp;A rather than logs.  I've always wanted to see somebody's thought process making a game from start to finish.<br /><br />Btw, if you were thinking about starting a blog, I'll definitely read it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Banshaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Maybe people don't want to talk about it because they're not ready yet to show it. ...

<br />
<br />I know this feeling well!  I don't think I ever showed anybody anything from my first project.  This time I figured what the hell, might as well throw it out there.  Even if nobody ends up reading it, it will be a good personal log for me.

<br />
<br />In my case, if I show my current project, people will say that I may be crazy <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> So once it start to move, I will show that I'm not.. If I can stop being a perfectionist correcting not very important details...  For not, it's a secret  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

<br />I'll be closely following the development, it's a pretty interesting read so far.
<br />Attribute nightmare, hehe. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I've started blogging about my project, too, but for the reasons Banshaku mentioned I refrained from telling people about it. Not as in-depth as MetalSlime's and not as frequently updated either, but here it is in case anyone is interested: <a href="http://morphcat.de/blog/" class="postlink">http://morphcat.de/blog/</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, this is pretty cool to see what people are doing. Unfortunately my site is under "inactive construction". By that I mean like when a street is under construction, but everyone's gone home for the day and there are still a bunch of cones and machines sitting there (and it's a huge mess). I was amidst redoing my site to look nice and be up-to-date when I got lazy and stopped, after I'd deleted pretty much everything so I could start from scratch <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.
<br />
<br />And as for attributes... I don't want to write an article about them! I hate them so much it makes me want to die. They have been the reason behind so many scrapped projects. The worst was an all-directional scroller I made that had these annoying, random attribute glitches that I could never figure out. If it weren't for that one little 4x2 attribute chunk on the bottom... They are definitely the hardest thing to deal with in NES programming, I think.
<br />
<br />I'm currently working on a platformer too. Perhaps I'll get the time to get my site back up so I can post more information about it.
