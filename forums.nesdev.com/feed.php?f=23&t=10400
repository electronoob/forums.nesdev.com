If said effect doesn't work for my region/etc, then I'm not really interested. <br /><br /> That said, I agree with ccovell. Awesome demo. And I'm glad you guys could tweak it to run on the NTSC systems now. I also agree that not all demos have to show completely new/different effects. Half the fun of watching a demo for these old systems, is the overall presentation.

Perhaps using <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Programming_with_unofficial_opcodes" class="postlink">the more useful unofficial opcodes</a> in games on simple discrete mappers like thefox's port of STREEMERZ (UNROM) might help convince emulator authors otherwise.<br /><br />In any case, basing emulator detection on the power-up state is ill advised.

Can't believe I forgot about posting this here.<br /><br />Last weeked the guys at Titan released a Mega Drive demo in Evoke called Overdrive. It got 1st place in the alternative hardware compo (by far) and it seems to be getting very popular =D I was one of the coders (you can see in the demo the full credits). We tried to push the hardware as much as we could and hopefully we have set the bar for future Mega Drive demos to come =O)<br /><br />You can download the ROM and have some links to video recordings here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61724">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=61724</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><strong>Note: demo only works properly in PAL, it won't work in NTSC. Moreover, all emulators have at least some sort of bug with this demo (even Exodus trips with the emulator check) as well as many clones (even the good ones, only superclones are exempt), so the only way to watch this demo properly is with original hardware.</strong><br /><br />If you wonder, I was involved mostly with the sound engine (both the original engine and assisting with the modifications for the custom version used here), and also helped with the tweaking of some other parts as well as a bunch of the base code. Also helped with obscure hardware information whenever a rare issue would appear (&quot;undocumented&quot; behavior, weird quirks, etc.).<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Tue Aug 20, 2013 7:35 am</p><hr />
