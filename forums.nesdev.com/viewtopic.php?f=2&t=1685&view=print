<br />Against frame IRQ :
<br />- Your main code will get interrupted (so timing code isn't possible during the frame).

<br />
<br />The REAL downside to using APU frame IRQs to regulate the music is that it borks split screen effects.  APU Frame IRQs can (and will) occur at any point in the frame -- and the music driver will eat quite a substantial amount of time.
<br />
<br />Even with the aid of mapper IRQs things will get screwed up real fast if you're not careful.  Say you have your mapper IRQ set to trip on a scanline where you want to split the screen.  Now what happens when your APU IRQ trips 10 cycles before your mapper IRQ would trip?  You're essentially screwed, as the music driver code will run first, postponing your split-screen code until you RTI (which will take several scanlines).
<br />
<br />One solution to this is to acknowledge the APU frame IRQ and then CLI right away so that another IRQ can interrupt your APU IRQ code.  This could work, but the extra latency of going through an second IRQ will really make it harder to time a hit to HBlank.
<br />
<br />
<br />Personally -- I would just stick with NMIs.  KISS.  There's no real benefit for using APU frame IRQs in this fashion and it adds a world of unnecessary complication.

<br />However, if you code say an RPG, you'll have no reason to do any split effects during the frame.
<br />Overall, I just think the frame IRQ hardware has been basically designed for sound engine purposes, and then it becomes useless if not used as it, because it cannot be used for split stuff either (this has been discussed just before).
<br />
<br />Yes, there is a PAL version of MegaMan 3, and I don't know if it has been dumped, but I have it. On the real PAL console with the real MM3 card, when protoman whistle, you hear the sequel to the whistle song that you're supposed to hear only in the enging - because the music was fixed to play faster in the NES's viewpoint to compensate the fact that the NES runs slower, but the timer that acts in gameplay seems to not have been touched. This wouldn't happen if the music engine was running at 60Hz, because the tempo wouldn't have to be changed.
<br />And doing the trick you shown to correct would be bad, because it would remove linearity in the sound causing pitch and volume effects to have gaps, and additionnaly it will consumme more time one frame out of six wich isn't very good.
<br />Correct pitch is MUCH easier than correct timing, just change the values in your pitch table (assuming you have a pitch table, but I don't think how you could code a sound engine without).
<br />
<br />BTW Megaman 3 PAL has a ton of glitches with MMC3's IRQ. On the second to last battle, where I think IRQ is normally used to scroll Wily's machine separatly from the ground the whole screen flicker. If I remember correctly, when the menu is oppen it flickers (because it is also done via MMC3 IRQ) and isn't usable. That way, the doctor Wily is totally unbeatable on the PAL version, unless it's just me. Surprising I've never head anyone about that bug, that is much more annoying than the protoman's whistle bug-

<br />NT2's playback code does the exact opposite (skipping calls every 6th frame when run on NTSC). It causes artifacts on arpeggios, sharp volume envelopes, and similar effects.

But still.  IRQ+BIT $4015+CLI  is 13 cycles.

It's rather hackish, but can be easily slapped into a setup that wasn't built to support PAL.  But like I said initially -- if you keep PAL in mind when developing your music engine, supporting it isn't really that hard at all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">and additionnaly it will consumme more time one frame out of six wich isn't very good.</div><br /><br />considering the inflated VBlank time you're given on PAL -- I don't think that'd be much of an issue -- but you're right.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Correct pitch is MUCH easier than correct timing, just change the values in your pitch table (assuming you have a pitch table, but I don't think how you could code a sound engine without).</div>
<br />
<br />And what makes correct timing more difficult?  You could just as easily have a length table just like you have a pitch table.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />The bottom line is, using Frame IRQs inhibits you.  It makes it harder to do things, and even prevents you from doing some things.  Instead of asking yourself "why not use Frame IRQs?" and then finding ways to work around the problems Frame IRQs cause -- you should be asking yourself "why bother with Frame IRQs?"  I mean really -- the only pro I've heard so far is that it makes tempo adjustment for PAL support a little easier -- but really, that's not much of an issue if you plan ahead for it.

Run your sound code at the end of your NMI handler, after all time-critical stuff is done. If you're advocating any other approach, you first have to show some significant advantages, not just show how the problems can be worked around.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Overall, frame IRQ has one single advantage on NMI hanlding : It has the same frequencey on both systems.
<br />My sound driver does have a lenght table but it's sort of different : Each note is x "ticks" long, and the ticks are done by incrementing a tempo variable by the song's tempo constant every frame. If there is overflow, then the frame is a "tick" (the song logic advance), else it is not (only volume and pitch effects are done, but not the song logic).
<br />I think the lenght table wouldn't be changed, but the tempo constant for each tune would. This would cause problems only when the main gameplay is in syncronous with the music or sound effects, but I think this is a smaller problems than problems with IRQ stuff, so definitely, frame IRQ are useless and NMI hanling is better.

All the tests I have performed on the frame IRQ show that it's appr. 50 Hz, and has a slightly longer phase than the NMI. This makes it a completely useless interrupt IMO. The only reason for using it that I can see is if you would build your own simplified NSF-player using just the CPU without the PPU.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If it's around ~55 or ~56 Hz that would make a lot of sense.
<br />
<br />Since the CPU clock rate is slower on PAL, the APU frame sequencer will run slightly slower as well.  If the APU hardware is the same on both systems, then APU frame IRQs will probably run about 56 Hz:
<br />
<br />PAL_CPU / (NTSC_CPU / NTSC_irq_rate) = PAL_irq_rate
<br />
<br />1662607 / (1789772 / 60)  =  ~56
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />But from what you're saying it's slower than that?  Closer to 50?  Perhaps the APU frame sequencer steps are closer together on PAL.  We may need some in-depth testing and documentation on this one.

So for music you'd end up with little pauses in the music playback (very brief ones, but I can't imagine it helping anything).
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">That will call the normal (NTSC) play routine 1 extra time every 5 frames, effectivily making the music 1.2x faster (changing ~50Hz to ~60Hz) </div>
<br />
<br />That burns up CPU cycles though.  In the worst case, the sound frames that take longer to process than the others will get called twice.
<br />
<br />A better way, I think would be to use fixed-point counts for the tempo.  Then it would be pretty trivial to adjust it for NTSC/PAL and still run the code once per frame, just adjust some equations.  Same thing applies to the rest of a game too, just that it becomes less trivial to cover everything.
