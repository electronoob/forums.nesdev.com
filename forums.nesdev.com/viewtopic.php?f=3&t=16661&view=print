		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Game number 14 on the Asder 20-in-1 multicart is &quot;Benico&quot;, a game that has not been discovered so far in single-cartridge form. While gameplay is emulated fine, during the self-running demo, the game performs a number of writes in the $F000-$F0FF range that throw most emulators off, causing graphical corruption. I can mask them off by excluding the F000-F07E area from the bankswitching emulation code without problems, but I'm wondering: what is the game doing there that it's not doing during actual gameplay?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, in fact I would think that.<br /><br />But that was not my original question. My original question was that regardless of whether that individual game works correctly on the multicart hardware or not, the programmers of that individual game intended those F000-F0FF writes made during attract mode to do something, and I cannot figure out what that would be, and that <em>someone</em> might have an idea of what that could be.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The routine that writes to $F000,Y reads from a pointer that usually points to somewhere in $E000. The value that is written is the simulated joypad input during attract mode.<br /><br />I strongly suspect that the way attract mode was created was they put the game on a RAM cart, and wrote the sequence of button inputs into $F000,Y. For final manufacture, these 128 byte sequences were then moved to other locations in ROM, and the code that read from the controllers was replaced with a playback loop reading from the pointer instead. Since the original game was released as NROM, there was no need to remove the side-effect-less writes to the PRG ROM addresses.
