		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not too long ago I added a feature to Famitracker which will allow you to write an exporter for your own sound engine that works with Famitracker. I also wrote an example sound driver and an example exporter DLL for that driver. It is based on concepts I learned from the Nerdy Nights sound tutorials (thanks MetalSlime!). I'm hoping some people out there might be able to use the example out of the box in their own games and then maybe improve it for their own use, or write exporters for other sound engines.
<br />
<br />I wrote the feature mainly because I didn't need quite as much sophistication as the Famitracker driver had built in, I wanted a lightweight driver that would make sound effects easy to implement as well. And, more importantly, I wanted to still be able to use Famitracker to compose the music.
<br />
<br />*edit* There have been lots of edits to this top post, but I wanted to keep it clean and not have too many links to old builds of stuff. The following will be updated as bug fixes and so on are added, until the next release of Famitracker is available.
<br />
<br />Here is a new development snapshot, with some new features. The plugin interface is now a pure C function interface, so plugins can be written with non Microsoft compilers. I have included information in README.txt on how to compile an example plugin with g++ under Cygwin as an example. Also, a new function, GetExt, has been added to the interface, as per Shiru's request, so that plugins can suggest what extension is appropriate for its format.
<br />
<br />*edit* A development snapshot, containing source, windows XP binaries, and a demo rom

<br />
<br />Here is a link posted by Shiru in <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7249" class="postlink">General Music and Sound Solution</a> to a plugin he wrote which can export in a parsable text format.
<br /><a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/temp1/textexport.zip" class="postlink">Parsable Text Exporting Plugin</a>

<br />Here is Shiru's thread about his new sound engine, FamiTone, that can be used with this plugin system: <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7288" class="postlink">FamiTone</a>.

<br />
<br />So here's my humble feature request: an exporter that creates a text file containing all of the info in the FTM in a stable, fairly easy to parse format. Then people could pipe this text file into a filter written in Perl, Python, JScript, GNU C++, or whatever else might already be installed on the developer's machine.

<br />A text serialization of all info in the .ftm isolates exporter developers from not only MFC but also Win32 itself. NESICIDE, a Qt app, could call the exporter in FT and then parse the text that it generates. In theory, this would work even on a Linux machine that can run FT in Wine.

<br />
<br />In the future, maybe all export from FT should be external (nsf, FT binary, raw text data etc). You would just be adding one new dll in the folder for some new functionality.
<br />
<br />As for the dependencies, I would try to remove them since it doesn't make sense unless you need them inside the dll itself, which shouldn't be the case since you parse data only.  
<br />
<br />If possible, I would try to see how to make it a COM interface. I'm sure some people must be looking at me and thinking "what the hell are you thinking!? COM?! barf!" (etc, etc). There is one reason for this: if you make the plugin COM based you can make the DLL in any language that support COM. This mean: win32, vb6, .net etc.  New light programming should be made in .net anyway and with the included framework, there is no reason to not do so.
