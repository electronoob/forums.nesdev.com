Now, I have a million and one questions I could ask but I dont want to if I'm not gona get an answer. So I'm gona ask just one: would you be willing to answer a lot of very noob questions? If so can you contact my AIM @ spammergirl666? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> (Thats two questions isn't it?)

<br />
<br />Not to mention asking us to get an instant messenger to contact YOU so that we can answer your questions is pretty back-asswards.  You're already contacting us here... why should be jump through hoops to contact you when you've already established contact?  That just makes things harder for us.
<br />
<br />But yeah -- most of us are willing to answer newb questions.  However I doubt many of us are willing to download/install/signup for AIM just to answer your questions.  Especially considering your AIM ID is something that indicates you might be pulling our leg and/or wasting our time.
<br />
<br />EDIT -- didn't mean to come off so harshly.  Don't want to scare you off or anything -- just making a point.  ^^

<br />
<br />Lest the real reason for public question-and-answer be lost, here it is: having it public makes the answers available others in a similar situation, and opens them to correction by others. Asking for private help means that the answers definitely won't benefit anyone else.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, making it public opens it to trolling by certain people. The best that can be said is that the only truely stupid people are those who think that asking basic questions is stupid. Even a totally clueless person asking questions will eventually become clueful; it only matters where a person is headed, not where he is at the moment.

<br />We have few rules here. Fewer than most forums do. You can speak/write as you like, but you get a better chance of getting an useful answer if you phrase your questions better... =)

<br />
<br />Think about it. Linking to warez sites will likely get us in trouble, and could possibly lead to this entire site being <strong>shut down</strong>.
<br />
<br />I would also highly recommend thinking <em>before</em> you press "Submit" (as opposed to what you state in your signature), or a lot of people will probably become annoyed by your posting style and be less likely to help.
<br />
<br />I would highly recommend reading <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" class="postlink">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a> if you'd like to learn how to last longer on other forums without being blown off and ignored.
