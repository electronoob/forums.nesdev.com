It's like one instruction to disable emulation mode right after boot, so that's not a problem, pretty much every SNES game does that already. It would be worse if it started in native mode and every 6502 program that would run on it would break.<br /><br />I wouldn't worry too much about compatibility with all Famicom and NES games. Isn't this supposed to be a new console that only uses NES compatibility as a fall-back for programmers that don't want to dedicate too much time to a system no one has?<br /><br /><br />BTW I started drawing up my own fantasy system some time ago, also using the 65816: <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Fantasy Computer Fancom<br />A fantasy 8-/16-bit computer and video game console.<br /><br />CPU: 65816<br />Video: ELF-VPU<br />Sound: SIREN-APU, Z80 core<br />ROM: BIOS, DWARF-BASIC (changeable)<br />RAM: 16 kB (expandable)<br />Save Memory: 64 kB EEPROM (expandable)<br />Ports: 4 controller ports, PS/2, USB, Cassette Tape, Expansion port, Cartridge port,<br />SD-card port, RGB video, AV (RCA), S-video, 3.5 mm stereo headphone, HDMI.<br /><br />Video Processing Unit<br />ELF-VPU, a custom chip that is similar to the Yamaha VDPs for MSX,<br />Hudon's VDC for PC Engine and Nintendo's PPU.<br />VRAM: 64 kB<br />Colors: 24-bit RGB, 16x16 palettes (shared by sprites and BG characters)<br />Sprites: 64 sprites, 16 on a scanline, hardware collision, sizes: 8x8;<br />8x16; 16x16 (mix freely), zooming, x-/y-flipping.<br />Background: 2 BG layers and a backdrop color, 8x8 characters, 256x224 dot.<br />Scroll: Both backgrounds, both axes, pixel-by-pixel.<br />Display Modes: Text, Graphic, Bitmap.<br />Interrupt: Vblank, collision and sprite overflow.<br />Output: RGB, S-video, composite (NTSC and PAL), HDMI.<br /><br />VRAM content:<br />Background Name Table (BGNT)<br />Sprite Attribute Table (SPAT)<br />Pattern Table (PATT) (shared by sprites and BG characters)<br />Palette Table (PALT)<br /><br />Audio Processing Unit<br /><br />Channels:<br />Rectangle<br />Triangle<br />Sawtooth<br />Noise<br />Programmable Waveform<br />PCM<br /><br />Databus is 16-bit.

Things that play arbitrary sized samples and allow any kind of loop points are typically called samplers instead of wavetables.

The GUS is a sampler. All samplers can be used for wavetable synthesis, too, because wavetable is a subset of sampler.<br /><br />So... yeah GUS was marketed with a nebulous use of the word &quot;wavetable&quot; (and technically it can be used as one), but you can use the word &quot;sampler&quot; to disambiguate that it's not just wavetable.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sawtooth waveforms aren't actually all too useful in themselves in plain use, because they're too rich in overtone for many applications. The basic idea of a saw is that it needs to be filtered, and filters have been fairly uncommon in vgm chips and/or surrounding circuitry (SID is a notable exception). They're still good to have around, though.  <br /><br />A &quot;super saw&quot; would require multiple oscillators, or maybe alternatively a round robin single oscillator like in N163, or a long sample.<br /><br />EDIT: Here's what a simple supersaw instrument on N163 would sound like. I had to dampen the upper edge because it's causing a lot of noise when moving straight to lower; it becomes apparent when using 7 saws at once. <br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br /><br /><strong>re: pokun:</strong> A wawetable chip could be more quick/easy to interface if you let each channel toggle between user-defined RAM and a &quot;factory setting&quot; from onboard ROM. There the standard could specify/provide strips of waveforms for all your basic waveform needs: Pulses with varying duties (PWM sweeps), Sine to triangle, Triangle to pulse, cycled noise, and so on.

I also like the echo on the SPC700 and the fact you can play around with FIR filters, but it would be even cooler if you can arbitrarily change the delay amount so you can make flanging and chorus effects.  Also it should have interlinked FM synth.<br /><br />I'm not sure if all this stuff would've made the chip expensive in the late 80s to early 90s though.

So for example a low-pitched square or saw wave can sound very filtered in a sampler.
