<br />
<br />The MMC1 (or this clone in your case)  is a custom ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).  What this means is it's a non-standard part.  You can't just go buy one from digikey like the counters and logic gate chips off a CNROM or UNROM board.
<br />
<br />It would be like trying to buy a replacement part for a model-T at your local ford dealer.  It just ain't going to happen.  No one makes those parts anymore.  Nor would you have really been able to buy them even when they were current parts because the design is proprietary.
<br />
<br />You really only have two options.  Take the chip off a game made a couple decades ago, or go with retro usb's board.  
<br />
<br />What he's selling is not exactly the same thing as the original part.   He's programmed a CPLD (complex programmable logic device) to act like the MMC1.  basically a CPLD can be programmed to perform in anyway you'd like it to.  While you can buy a CPLD from an electronic supplier, that wouldn't solve your problem.  You've got to know how the MMC1 works and how to program a CPLD to perform as the MMC1 did.  Based on your questions that doesn't sound like something within your capabilities.
<br />
<br />So you could by his board with the CPLD already programmed to act like the MMC1 for you.  Or steal the part off a donor board.

<br />This way sounds very interesting.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I don't know how to do it now but I can try it out by doing some research. Can you introduce me some resource to start?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm actually working on doing some of this type of stuff right now with a related project I've posted up recently:  All in one master dev cart.
<br />
<br />It's hard for me to point you in the right direction without knowing your knowledge background.
<br />
<br />First off you need to understand the basics of digital logic. ie, how gates, latches, flipflops, counters, and all that of stuff works.  I'm guessing you have some level of understanding of this stuff.  
<br />
<br />With some base knowledge there you need to understand how bankswitching or "page turning" works on NES carts.  Start off with the basic UNROM, CNROM and work your way up to MMC1 and MMC3.  The best resource for this stuff is right here with our Wiki and other resources on nesdev.
<br />
<br />Then you'll have to somehow pick up the skill of programing a CPLD or it's similar more complicated brother the FPGA.  This isn't really a walk in the park.  Including programming in a hardware description language (VHDL or Verilog).  People typically pick up these skills in formal education, but there are enough resources out there you could learn it all from the web.  It's just a little difficult in the begining because when you confused about the basics you don't have someone you can ask directly like you could in a lab at school.  
<br />
<br />I'd recommend starting off with some sort of CPLD development kit something similar to this: <a href="http://www.altera.com/literature/ug/ug_maxv_cpld_dev_kit.pdf" class="postlink">http://www.altera.com/literature/ug/ug_maxv_cpld_dev_kit.pdf</a>
<br />I can't really recommend a good one you'll have to do more research on that yourself.  But a kit like this has a step by step on how to program the CPLD and setup your circuit all put together for you.  Then once you've got that down you could make up and test out your own reverse engineered mapper start with the simple ones before you try to tackle the MMC1.  Then you could buy just the CPLD chip program it and slap it in on you cart board similar to what retrozone is selling you.
<br />
<br />Have fun!  You'll definitely learn alot through the process, assuming you don't quit after slamming your head against your desk when you get stuck and frustrated...  But hey that's why this and other forums are out there for right?

<br />
<br />Is this just a good guess or you do know of it?! 
<br />Do you have any datasheet or pinout for this chip? 
<br />However I can find out the pinout by using the cartridge itself.

<br />What's the price on them?
<br />
<br />I know its easier said then done, but either way a CPLD seems like a better option for a MMC1 clone.
