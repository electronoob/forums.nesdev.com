<br />
<br />Can I have more details about this ?
<br />When running the test on my GBA I see horizontal lines that aren't visible in Visual Boy Advance. The programm is flickering blue and yellow, and on the GBA it appers like one pixel out of two is blue and the other yellow. The results are the same on my DS, and that for both screens. There is no GBC version but I assume the results would be the same as the text sates. The horizontal lines are visible in some games when there is flickering objects (the Airship's shdadows in Final Fantasy games is a good thing to see that)
<br />
<br />Does that means even lines on the GBC/GBA/DS are refresehed one frame and odd lines another ? I bet many scrolling backgrounds would look terrible if that were the case (might be wrong).
<br />
<br />(PS : Tepples to show a 6 pixel wide font on the GBA why not use a bitmap mode instead of wasting mode-7 scaling for that ?)
<br />
<br />Would be great if someone would release a LCD filter emulating this behavior, GBC/GBA/DS equivalent of NTSC filter.

That's one reason why games use tiled modes in the first place, and why PocketNES and Goomba map emulated system tiles to GBA tiles instead of doing a full software rendering like Lameboy does. Besides, on the GBA, mode 1 still has two "text" backgrounds; the extended rotation modes (3-5) do not unless you're on a DS booted into DS mode.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Would be great if someone would release a LCD filter emulating this behavior, GBC/GBA/DS equivalent of NTSC filter.</div>
<br />Pixel ordering (RGB on one of the original DS's screens, or BGR on GBA, GBA SP, DS Lite, and the DS's other screen) would also be useful for a 2x-4x upscaler. But most new desktop PCs and all laptops come with LCD monitors, and the video processing inside a monitor might interfere. The closest you can get without requiring a CRT or plasma monitor is emulating the screwed up black level and gamma (see "GAMMA" screen in Static).

<br />I don't see much difference between my PC which is connected to a CRT screen and the other one who has a LCD. Scrolling text doesn't look very good on the LCD, but there is no noticeable motion blur, and the results of your flickering tests doesn't look like the real hardware at all (no horizontal lines, just flickering yellow/blue).

<br />In that case, it might take high-speed cameras to gain a handle on what the GBA LCD is really showing at any given moment, just as it took an oscilloscope to see what signal the NES was creating.

<br />The same way interlacing will apparently double the framerate of a low-framerate screen, I'd imagine. Update the screen slower, motion blur is reduced greatly; many older gameboy-phat games use this technique, i.e. why many games have "choppy" movement in comparison to the smooth movement of the nes. Offset the refreshing of the scanlines, and you pretty much get interlacing. The screen looks like it's updating at 60hz, but each scanline is actually getting the 'major' update every 30hz.

<br />Okay, but I still don't understand <em>what</em> works. You haven't mentionned it, and that frustrates me (sorry). I'd like to know what kind of artifacts are caused on the GBA screen. Some games seems to higly rely on flickering each frame behaviour :
<br />- Golden Sun (and it's sequel) when overworld
<br />- US version of FF4 advance when in water (europan version uses real transparency)
<br />- Pocket NES
<br />
<br />For that reason I belive it's important to understand what is happening and, it would be great if someone could implement a LCD filter emulating such behavior.
