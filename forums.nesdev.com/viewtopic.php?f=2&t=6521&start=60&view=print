<br />Think of it as 'adc #-80'. The use of "negative" numbers with an up-counter should be familiar to anyone who has ever programmed the Game Boy or GBA audio system: both the Game Boy tone generators and the GBA sample timer use up-counters that reload when they become zero. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PackBits" class="postlink">PackBits RLE format</a>, used by MacPaint and my nametable tools, also uses an up-counter for run lengths, though it stops at 1 instead of 0.

<br />Just for the record, things became worse without it. With the NOP I can stare at the screen for minutes without seeing a single glitch, but without it something goes wrong every few seconds and the split point moves significantly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are still a LOT of things to clean up and adjust (the timing is still pretty off), but it looks like the idea works. Here's the program changing the color emphasis bits at dynamic scanlines (this is still NTSC only): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://membler-industries.com/tokumaru/dmc.nes">http://membler-industries.com/tokumaru/dmc.nes</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />As soon as it's acceptably stable I'll release the source code. All you'll have to do to use this is call a function with a number of scanlines in the accumulator, and after that number of scanlines a function will be called. It's inside this function that you'll code your raster effects. You don't have to understand how it works internally, you just have to trust that the function will be called at the correct time.
<br />
<br />Not everything is perfect though. There is the overhead of a few IRQs firing before the actual split point (they are 18 scanlines apart on NTSC and 16 on PAL), and there can be a lot of waiting near the split point. I'm not sure how much CPU time will be stolen from your main thread, but it's certainly less than 100%! =) If your game loop is not so intense you can probably get away with 2 or 3 splits in some special areas (bosses and such).

<br />Tokumaru, your demo looks like nothing but in fact it's awesome (except for the fact it's NTSC only but I hope it's technically portable to PAL). Did you made a method that combines IRQ + timed code to be able to do something like that ?

The goal here is that you can have a graphical effect in any scanline you want without sacrificing 100% of your CPU time and all you need is the relative scanline number (i.e. how many scanlines after you call the function), without having to worry about how it's done. Once it's fully working I'll make something that looks nicer.<br /><br />My goal is to make it PAL compatible dynamically, it just needs to initialize a couple of variables differently, which in my game I intend to do shortly after reset, when I detect the type of the console. So the same code should work for both PAL and NTSC, you don't even need to recompile.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Did you made a method that combines IRQ + timed code to be able to do something like that ?</div>
<br />Yes. In NTSC the IRQs are roughly ("roughly" means that the difference has to be taken into account later) 18 scanlines apart, and 16 in PAL. Every time an IRQ fires, those numbers are subtracted from the number of scanlines until the split, and when that number becomes smaller than 18 (NTSC) or 16 (PAL) IRQs are stopped and the routine that waits scanlines with timed code is called. Of course this is combined with tepples' method of counting the time until the first IRQ to know how out of sync the APU is in relation to the PPU so that this can be compensated.

<br />It's nice I'd have to store only 1 file on the powerpak, but it sounds like it would introduce a major complication/overhead in the code.
<br />
<br />(if you haven't noticed yet, I always do separate NTSC/PAL versions of my demoes, but they always compile from the same file, I just add a ".define PAL" to enable PAL mode and use conditional assembly). Not that you are forced to go this way, but it simplifies stuff when coding timed code.

<br />I used to do that, but once I noticed it wouldn't be so hard to have both in the same binary I though it was worth the trouble. At first it's a bit hard to consider all the branches and make sure that all possible paths use the correct amount of cycles, but once this is done you don't have to worry about it ever again, I think it's nice.
