<br />This is one thing I dislike about the Mega Man games... sometimes you are forced to get hurt, or even loose a life. I still like the Mega Man series (although I do find it hard!), but I don't think a game should require you to get hurt. It should be possible to beat levels perfectly, without a single hit, so that you can aim at perfection. Maybe those guys that make tool-assisted speedruns can do it? Or maybe only I suck at it! =)

<br />
<br />Metal Man stage: You mean the drills? you can avoid them if you are REALLY careful, but definitely not in a speed run fashion.
<br />
<br />Cannon Boss: Actually, the best way to beat them is to use Item 1, 2, and 3 to move around the level and only use crash bombs when absolutely necessary, that way you run out on the last cannon.  In this sense I find the loss of health acts as a "timer" of sorts because you can't avoid the hits and therefore if you don't act fast enough, youll be killed.

<br />If I remember correctly you can avoid the hit if you're lucky enough (the canons shoot at you so you just have to moove constantly, and there needs to be some of the cannons to be already defeated to have it wokring.
<br />And no, you're forced to destroy the walls first, get killed and kill the cannons the second try. Even if you manage to avoid all shots and kills some of the canons before being killed, you'll eventually run out of mana, and there is no mana capsules nor any thing that you could defeat to give you one, so no matter how skilled or lucky you are, you need to loose a life once.

<br />And yes, the begining of Super Metroid was memorable, almost give me nightmares.

<br />
<br />dude, you are wrong, not only have I done it myself but there is a walkthrough on GameFaqs that reminded me how to do it in the first place.  If you use the items 1,2, and 3 aka the vertical platform, the wall platform, and the rocket platform you can beat the boss without losing a life.  Go look on gamefaqs and see for yourself, I think its <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/file/563442/3050">http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/file/563442/3050</a><!-- m --> .  I'll even post an excerpt:
<br />"
<br />------------
<br />Wily Cannons
<br />------------
<br />Weapon Used: (C) Crash Bomber
<br />
<br />  The objective for this fight is to eliminate all of the cannons using the
<br />Crash Bomber, but as you might expect, the catch is that some of the cannons
<br />are blocked by walls that can only be destroyed with the same weapon.  You
<br />only have a limited amount of energy, and one mistake means you WILL fail!
<br />
<br />  This is how the room is laid out ("X" indicates a barrier, while a number
<br />represents a cannon):
<br />
<br />                            ____________________
<br />                           |    ___|            |
<br />                           |   |2 _X       __   |
<br />                           |   | |_|     3|  |  |
<br />                           |___|        |__  |  |
<br />                           |1_X   ____     | |  |
<br />                           |___| |__  |     X__4|
<br />                           |         X    _|    |
<br />                           |        | |  |______|
<br />                           |________| |__X_____5|
<br />
<br />
<br />  Use Item-1 to reach the ledge facing Cannon 1, and fire the Crash Bomber
<br />twice (one for the wall and one for the gun).  Deploy another platform on the
<br />very bottom (do it a little higher this time) to leap up nearby Cannon 2.
<br />Once it is destroyed, take out 3 and 4.  Activate Item-3 to climb out of the
<br />hole, and work on eliminating the final cannon."
<br />
<br />unfortunately the "map" is garbled so youll have to read it on gamefaqs, but I have personally used this method and beat the boss without losing a  life.  If you still don't believe me, I will screen capture the whole fight and put it on youtube if you bet me $10 paypal <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> (In other words, paying me for my time).

Even when using unlimited lives cheats, some specific parts are virtually impossible to pass in two-player mode without using the electricity cheat... namely jumping the springs in The Revolution. As much as I love this game, RARE should've spent some more time beta testing it in two-player mode.

It's not just him, it's those STUPID dragon snake things before him. Whoever decided that all enemies in later levels do 4 bars of damage needed to not do that. Sometimes I wish the NES had a Save State function, because I would use it before death and I would come equipped with the "III" thing that lets you do 3 subweapons, and I would have the axes. Everyone says that the best weapon to use against Death is the cross, but I think the axes are a lot better.
<br />
<br />The boss of Mega Man X is really annoying if you lose, because you have to fight that stupid dog again. And also, fill up your energy tanks with the worm things coming out of the pipes.
<br />
<br />I've never reached the boss of Mega Man 1, so I can't be of much help.

<br />I guess you such then.... No seriously if you don't post more details it's impossible to tell, but I beat Mega Man 1 a couple of times without cheats. I have never been able to beat Mega Man 4, 5 or 6 yet while most people seems to say they are easier than 1,2,3. That's really weird.
<br />
<br />BTW about Battletoads, it's really incredible, the japanese version is really MUCH MUCH easier ! They removed lot of spikes and enemies, boss have much less HP, and there is unlimited continues (I think). I beat both the rat race and the clinger winger (the two more infamously hard levels) on the FIRST try !! I cannot belive how this version is easier than the usual one.
<br />And there is japanese peolpe arround to give critics of western games to be too easy... HAHAHAHA.
<br />
<br />And yes Mega Man X is very very easy, exept the last boss wich is very very hard. That's fun, because I noted that 99% of games are either really really hard but have a joke as a final boss (Contra series, Gradius series, Battletoads, etc...) or are rather easy all the way along but have a very damn impossible last boss (Mega Man 2, Mega Man X, Kirby's Adventure, etc...)
<br />
<br />And about Castlevania, yes the 4 poins damage is really annoying. I sometimes have trouble to beat Frankenstein too, but this is doable if you have luck. However beat the daeath is realy realy hard if you don't have the holy water, wich is not present in the last section before it. I think I once almost beat him without cheating, but I finally just lost (that's my best score to CV1 ever). With holy water I've heard the death is a joke but it's very hard to still have holy water there, an if you mess up one time it's over.
<br />
<br />PS : Oh one last thing. Did anyone notice how Squenix dratiscally reducted the difficulty in FF1&amp;2 Dawn of souls and FF4,5,6 Advance ?? That's a true crime to their original counterparts !
