There are some cases where you might want to reuse/reassign a static allocation, like if your game changes to a different mode.<br /><br />If you know they're never going to be needed at the same time, you can still reassign the same memory statically. There's no encapsulation or type safety here, if you .rs a byte of memory, that's a byte you can use any way you want, and you can give the same byte many names/labels.<br /><br />In NSEASM you can use .rsset to reset the .rs reservations to the address you want to overlap, and then create a new set of reservations on top. In CC65 you could do something similar with overlapping segments. Or you can just directly create an alias for an old reservation, if that's convenient (&quot;new_name = old_name&quot;).<br /><br />When doing this, though, you should probably have a clear plan of how you want to lay out memory. Know what's supposed to be &quot;global&quot; and survives the mode switch, and what isn't. Have a good idea of how much space each should take up, and maybe leave some extra room just in case you need it later. Though, this is something you might want to think about even if you're not trying to overlap stuff. If RAM is scarce it pays to manage your RAM budget. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Aug 13, 2018 3:58 pm</p><hr />

Here's a shorter answer. You don't &quot;free up memory&quot;, you just stop refering to it, and then when another object needs it, you initialize it with the values for that object.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7819">Sumez</a> — Mon Aug 13, 2018 3:15 pm</p><hr />

Basically you create an object &quot;class&quot;. Say it has xPos, and yPos only for simplicity. In a higher level language you'd create an array of class objects. On NES it's better on the CPU to create an array of each element.<br />The higher level way:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">const int objectnum = 16;<br />struct object{<br />   int xPos;<br />   int yPos;<br />};<br />object objects&#91;objectnum&#93;;<br /></div><br />The NES way<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">const int objectnum = 16;<br />int xPos&#91;objectnum&#93;;<br />int yPos&#91;objectnum&#93;;<br /></div><br /><br />Unlike a higher level thing, it's best to just have a fixed maximum number of objects. If you want a maximum of 16 objects with 16 elements, that's 256 bytes.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">objectnum = 16<br />xPos .rs objectnum<br />yPos .rs objectnum<br /></div><br />To access their RAM, you have their object number in either X, or Y, and access their element using ,y or ,x addressing like so.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">inc yPos,x<br />lda objectstate,x<br /></div><br />If you have a byte that says whether or not they're alive, on a really basic level you could have a type byte. If type is say... equal to zero, it means the object is dead. So destroying an object is as simple as storing zero to its type byte. (Maybe zeroing out the rest of its RAM as well.) Creating an object is as simple as looking for an object number that has a type byte equal to zero, and then changing the type byte of that object to the type of object you want to create. (And initializing its RAM to a state that type of object expects.)<br /><br />Here's a long post I wrote on the subject with some more advanced methods: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=13061&amp;p=152230&amp;hilit=linked#p152230">viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=13061&amp;p=152230&amp;hilit=linked#p152230</a><!-- l --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Mon Aug 13, 2018 2:22 pm</p><hr />

One thing. You can access objects faster in asm if you make each attribute a separate array. So, rather than an array of objects (with x,y,type,state,etc)...you have an array of x's, an array of y's, an array of types, etc.<br /><br />You load the object number into the X register, and you can access it's attributes by using X as the index to each array. LDA x_array, X. Do something. LDA type_array, X.<br /><br />BTW, I don't do this myself, but I've seen others do this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7008">dougeff</a> — Mon Aug 13, 2018 2:13 pm</p><hr />

Hi klono,<br /><br />Um, I've never used nesasm but, from my experience with assembly language, variables (groups of bytes in RAM) can be declared before you assemble your game.  After assembly, I don't believe it's possible to destroy a variable or create a new one.  However, tokumaru told me how he uses temporary variables.  To create a temporary variable: <br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;your variable declaration section in zeropage goes here<br />;afterwards<br />LocalVariables4vblank<br />LocalVariables4scrollland<br />;etc.<br /><br />;then in my vblank file (I'm using the asm6 assembler)<br />.enum LocalVariables4vblank<br />  tE .dsb 2<br />  t14 .dsb 2<br />.ende</div><br />Then tE can be used anywhere below that variable declaration section.  Caution: Lets say your zeropage variables end with $0082.  That would cause all of the LocalVariables4 labels to be initialized to #$0083.  Therefore, tE would be assembled at locations $0083 and $0084 (because my temporary variables all have a size of 2 bytes... that's just me, feel free to use whatever size you want... it's your game. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />).  The tempory (local) variables should only be used when you do not require the value at a later frame, or even for a short while because many, I guess, other local variables will be assigned seats at those same memory locations and so the value may vanish whenever a store to that memory location is processed.  (The value wouldn't vanish if the store, sta stx or sty, assigned the exact same value to that memory location.)  Hope this helps you. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3893">unregistered</a> — Mon Aug 13, 2018 1:53 pm</p><hr />
