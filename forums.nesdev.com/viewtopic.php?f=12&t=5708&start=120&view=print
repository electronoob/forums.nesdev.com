		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My SNES PowerPak just arrived today in the mail and I am waiting until I return to school to test it. I was getting stuff ready to copy over to my compact flash card and it appears as though the latest SNES PowerPak bootrom isn't available for download. The link exists, but it just redirects to the main page.
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.retrousb.com/downloads/snespowerpakboot102.zip">http://www.retrousb.com/downloads/snesp ... oot102.zip</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I could get version 1.01, but I am unsure of whether that was the revision of the bootrom that had problems with compatibility. I'm not sure what version my SNES PowerPak shipped with however. It could be the newest one since it was shipped out on the 24th. I will report more information tomorrow after doing some initial testing. Also, will I need to flash the bootrom with an eprom programmer? Or is there a flashing utility built into the cart?

<br />I was really disapointed when my CF to SD card adapter didn't fit in the Power Pak. Oh well, can't have everything. Still a great product, especially now that I converted my old game copier saves to work on the Power Pak.
<br />
<br />Bunnyboy,
<br />
<br />I really hope you are going to continue the line of Power Paks. Please consider one for the Gameboy/Gameboy color. I have a Bung Xchanger but 64mb for a cart is too small.

I read that this could be caused by my system configuration, but it could also be from an incompatible compact flash card. I have a Sandisk Ultra II 2.0GB compact flash card, but I'd be willing to test one more card if that will help fix it. Also, I am using Windows 7 format utility to format the card. What is the best format to go with? FAT16 or FAT32? And what cluster size? Or should I get another tool?

<br />
<br />Next thing to try is setting DMA=0 in the CONFIG.TXT file in the POWERPAK directory.  Some cards can't handle the faster access time of the DMA mode, so it will get errors.
<br />
<br />And finally try another card.  The formatting is not likely to be the problem if you are getting that far in the boot process.

One thing that is odd, is that the 2GB DANE-ELEC card that  I got with the Powerpak doesn't work correctly with it.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> 
<br />
<br />When using the 2GB card, I get sporadic rom load failures, and when scrolling the rom lists there is visible corruption that begins to happen in the text of the rom names.  When using a Sandisk UltraII 8GB card, neither of these things happen.  
<br />
<br />Also for some reason, Test Drive II refuses to load, though the rom seems to be correct.  The Powerpak says 'ExLoROM 8Mbit unsupported' at the end of the message dump.
