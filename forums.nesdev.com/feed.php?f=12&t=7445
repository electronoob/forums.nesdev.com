Yup.<br /><br />Yes probably, I wasn't sure when it was valid (this might be the opposite of the 6502). It should make no difference for /RD though unless /RD and /WR just followed R//W which wouldn't be right since when you use an external register or something it has to be triggered on the rising edge of /WR.<br /><br />I still wonder if the data bus is buffered though. In the datasheet example they use a buffer which would add more delay. It can be tested by comparing the data bus @ rising edge of Phi2 with the bank address. Really a logic analyzer is needed to verify Nintendo's implementation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Mon Feb 07, 2011 3:26 pm</p><hr />

The reason the first way didn't work is because you are enabling the 257 with /RD. /RD is asserted on every memory read so you are trashing the bus. In the other thread I used a 139 decoder to create an OR gate (/ROMSEL OR /RD) which is the proper condition. I think you could change around the MAD-1 connections to get this condition too since both ROM decoders aren't used with a single ROM, just replace the "select" address line input with /RD.<br /><br />The transparent latch theory shows that /ROMSEL (and MAD-1 likely) will be asserted before /RD, I believe that's how it is.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Sat Feb 05, 2011 2:12 pm</p><hr />

Yes, I'm glad you agree now. No hard feelings!<br /><br />I believe the reason exchanging the signals still worked is because the 816 doesn't have picky timing.

<div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I understand how you think it should be but did you verify that your /OE pin is really /OE? Do you have the timings now?<br /></div><br /><br />No, I didn't verify it, I assumed what I found in ROMLab as true... But now I realize you're right, becasue it makes sense: /ROMSEL enables the MaskROM only when it is needed, thus saving power (decreasing consumption)... And there is a prove of that, besides the two you said: SRAM on those cartridges is enabled using the output of MAD-1, which uses /ROMSEL to decode that line. So SRAM is using /ROMSEL to enable it and /RD to enable its output. And now no mistake is possible, as I have SRAM's datasheet...<br /><br />Well then, that changes everything I believed in <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I should recheck my repro's schematics to understand why they work anyway and if there should be any other better way of making the wiring.<br /><br />As for MAD-1 delay, I don't feel like setting up again the proto board to test it, but maybe I'd do it some time in the future, if it is interesting to somebody.<br /><br />Thank you very much for your help!<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How I interpreted <strong>it</strong> would be <span style="text-decoration: underline">roughly</span> equivalent to <strong>this</strong>; stressing words makes an explanation sound authoritative, and in the right context (such as a very simple explanation) it can be perceived as condescending.<br /></div><br /><br />As for that, I don't think it sounds authoritative... in fact, it doesn't "sound"...
