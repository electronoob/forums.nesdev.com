I just asked kevtris, and he said double it up. I could explain the stance more formally: "If the PRG ROM data is 16384 bytes long, and the first 8192 bytes of the PRG ROM data match the second 8192 bytes, the PRG ROM is an 8Kx8 chip." You could think of it as no diferent from an 8208-byte header, 8192-byte PRG, and 8192-byte CHR.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Feb 14, 2010 1:15 pm</p><hr />

I have given a good thought about Membler's suggestion of using bank size of 0 to indicate the undersized dump. Then, I figured out that there is one very big flaw of this system.<br /><br />You see, this system requires the rom to be properly dumped. Think what would happen if the rom is over dumped. On the iNes header system, emulators locate the address of CHR based on the bank infomation of the header. But if we use 0 to indicate the PRG's being undersized, the emulator can't locate the CHR simply based on the bank information. Instead, it must use "the total size of image - the size of CHR". It will works if the rom is on the proper size, but will fail to locate the CHR if the rom is overdumped. <br /><br />Of course, if the bank size of 0 is used only for the 8kb instead of varialbly undersized rom, it will work no matter what. But now what we have to think about is that theoratically this should apply to the all the other 255 mappers (i.e. 0 means 8kb for all mappers). Emulation-wisely there is no problem with it, but would that be acceptable?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4223">kshin981</a> — Sun Feb 14, 2010 12:28 pm</p><hr />

It was brought to my attention that my idea for zero being any size repeated wouldn't work if CHR-ROM is used, because there'd be no known CHR start.  I don't think about using CHR-ROM all that much.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">~J-@D!~ wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I think that would be sensible that instead of numbering the number of 16K PRG banks, it could be... a power of two of the numbers of bytes of PRG.<br /></div><br /><br />I like that idea too, I think that would work.  But it needs another iNES format revision..  We may actually want the the larger size, I'm guessing the maximum with iNES is 4MB, and today it is no problem to buy FlashROMs larger than that (unfortunately they're not for a 5V bus like the NES).<br /><br /><br />kshin981:<br />Really I think the only emulator that is likely to load from an 8kB ROM is something like MESS (but it probably won't right now, my guess is that it only supports iNES format).  <br /><br />Sounds to me like that ROM collection needs to not put invalid headers on it's ROMs. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Also yeah people will be very averse to adding new mappers, because in the past there have been some messes caused by different people assigning numbers on their own.  There's no central authority, so there's nothing preventing anyone from picking a number, adding it to an emulator, and making an announcement/warning about it in case someone else wants to emulate it also.  One can only hope that later someone else doesn't unilaterally decide to use that number for something else.  I don't think there will be enough interest in this one, but I could be wrong.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Feb 10, 2010 3:04 pm</p><hr />

I am fine with it, but some people might not like it because it is just a logical sectioning, not actual banks.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What would you do for a game that uses a 4 KiB CHR ROM? <a href="http://lj65.org/" class="postlink">LJ65</a> is an example of an NES game using a 4 KiB CHR ROM, but the distributed version is padded to 8 KiB to fit the iNES format.<br /></div><br />Make another mapper, or you can adjust the mapper that I've supposed to incorporate the irregular CHR using the method.  <br /><br />However, the mapper that I am suggesting is primarily for the Galaxian, and I don't feel any obligation to make this mapper to incoporate every unrepresentable form of roms in iNes. If you have your own need for a certain type of a rom, that is curruntly unrepreseted by iNes mappers, I guess, than it is your time to find your solution. Don't bark me about that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4223">kshin981</a> — Wed Feb 10, 2010 8:03 am</p><hr />
