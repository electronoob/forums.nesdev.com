<br />
<br />Well, I was going to come here and request a re-rip of Excitebike (FDS), but after trapsing through this thread, I'm delighted to have found that it's already been done. Bravo Kingshriek! I definitely second the notion of a more comprehensive NES Game music database. It's all a bit of a mess; makes it hard to find stuff at current. But I got there. Great, great soundtrack. Ms. Oka is very talented indeed.

<br />
<br />OK Q-Boy is fixed and all the tunes are there and the SFX has been removed as I usually do. Thanks for the menu because I think that some of the banks had a sound driver on it but not the entire sound track and so the bank with the menu or the bank that the menu accessed had all the music on it so I was kinda fooled on this one as I had 6 tunes before and now there are 36 tracks.
<br />
<br />I'm planning on ripping the Super Cartridge games but here is the one you requested.

I would have included only the first 17; some might even want all 34: all those preferences can be met by just changing NSF header byte 6 to 17, 26 or 36, whatever you like.

<br />
<br />Unfortunatley, your NSF works for me only trough Meridian Advance (but without PCM), wich is by far not the best NSF player, but *every* others won't play anything. Nintendulator is way too slow to be used as an usual NSF player. It don't even run at full speed on his own on my PC, so I can even less use it in parallel with other programs to listen music, as I can do with Winamp. I think we need time so players programmers updates their players.
<br />
<br />What I like it that all songs are organized in a more logical way than before.
<br />Does anyone know where Battletoad track Nr 19 is heard in the game ??

<br />
<br />Have you tried in_nintendulator.dll, the Winamp plugin? It runs significantly faster than my emulator (only around 25% CPU on my system, since it doesn't have to bother with PPU emulation) and uses the same code+interface. The only drawback is that it switches tracks *without* stopping/restarting the audio stream in Winamp, so it will result in a delay equivalent to your buffer size.
