Sorry late to the party here...  I'm rather glad this thread's title didn't attract my interest until now though as I didn't actually get a chance to play until after the thread died down.  Safe to say reading this thread beforehand would have spoiled the game for me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'd prefer something like &quot;A reimagining of...&quot; But pubby and Paul at Infinite NES Lives have the final say.<br /></div><br /><br />I don't feel like my opinion is that important in this specific game, so I'll save it.  The bigger question is who decides what message players are to be presented with prior to playing the game.  Provided it's not obscene I honestly think this should be up to the creator.  While I get the arguments for the menu to be neutral, the risks/damages involved with over ruling creator's expression are much more significant than some number of players not enjoying or getting that one game because of a sentence.  <br /><br />Ultimately creator is the one responsible for making a game that's an enjoyable experience for their targeted player and the instructions are an extension of the game.<br /><br />If people playing the game have recommendations to the creator on how the instructions could have be improved, the creator can choose what to do with that feedback.  I don't feel this is something we need to regulate as compo/cartridge organizers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sat Mar 17, 2018 10:26 pm</p><hr />

Another different game that hits some similar notes is <a href="http://askiisoft.com/games/pause-ahead/" class="postlink">Pause Ahead</a>. But there are actually quite many with fake glitches and the like. Most of those I can name, I think it's technically spoilers, though.

I don't think &quot;bait and switch&quot; is even negative anymore, at least not in the context of releasing stuff online. Nowadays in Internet culture you've got things like Siivagunner high quality rips, where intentionally misrepresenting the thing you're posting is the whole point, and then having it lead into something else (and surprising a viewer that's unfamiliar with it) is popular and playful.<br /><br />When I saw Star Evil, combined with F-FF misrepresenting itself as a boring racing game, I thought that sort of playfulness was exactly what pubby was going for.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3838">NovaSquirrel</a> — Sun Feb 25, 2018 1:02 am</p><hr />

How can I recognize situations like this in the future where I will have done wrong?<br /><br />4. What should I do differently in each such situation?<br /></div><br /><br />1. Is not for me to address (although I think the original had an exclamation mark after classic), but if I were in the author's shoes, I'd be satisfied by now.<br /><br />2. Something like &quot;Handling Game Descriptions with Intentional Misdirection&quot; is likely how I'd phrase it… just something that would either be neutrally stated (or if neutral phrasing isn't available, erring on the side of positive connotation out of respect for those whose work is being discussed). Bait and switch has a strong negative connotation. Using it to describe someone else's work impolite at best, outright insulting at worst.<br /><br />3. When contemplating a change, ask yourself, &quot;Why would the author have done it this way to begin with?&quot; and if you can't come up with a good reason, asking the author directly, would be a good start.<br /><br />4. If at all possible, when contemplating a change, post it for the author to approve. If the change is drastic, phrase it as a suggestion or request.  For instance, &quot;I feel description x is inappropriate for this reason. Would it be okay if I used description y instead?&quot; If the answer returned is still unsatisfactory to you, then allowing the author to come up with a solution. Such as, &quot;I'm still uncomfortable with x. I would like to achieve [goal]. Is there a solution you have in mind that would achieve both (my desired goal and yours)?&quot;<br /><br />I appreciate the uniformity in formatting, and I fully understand and appreciate the need for grammatical and spelling corrections, etc. (I had to make a few of those on the poster for last year's) But, like Frankengraphics pointed out, there is a long enough time prior to publication to allow for mutually agreed upon corrections to be made. This is not only important for showing courtesy to the author, but also for accuracy. Sometimes your changes may end up including inaccurate information based on an honest misunderstanding (such as seems to be the case in the current Grunio A53 description, but I'll address that in its appropriate thread.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5942">M_Tee</a> — Sat Feb 24, 2018 10:33 pm</p><hr />

Man, I hate that the subject field is required! How can we fix that? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Do I need to leave NESdev.com? If not, what steps ought I to take to bring my behavior back in line?<br /></div><br />Come on man, not this drama again. Everyone makes poor decisions occasionally, everyone can be a dick sometimes, the important thing is to not do it intentionally and consistently enough that you're bothering people all the time.<br /><br />I say this in the most generic way possible, because I honestly haven't been following this thread for the past few pages, so I don't know how far the drama went for something that really isn't supposed to be such a big deal.<br /><br />If we're still discussing wether a deceptive game description is allowed in the compo cartridge, my vote is to let the author of the game do whatever he wants. If he feels that this is important to get players in the right mood to make the most out of the game, then that's just part of the experience of playing that game. A compilation cartridge is hardly an encyclopedia that has a strict commitment with the truth, and not everyone is required to like all of the games. If a player is sensitive enough to feel betrayed by an NES game then HE/SHE needs to work on that, because any normal person would simply avoid the game in the future.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Feb 24, 2018 9:12 pm</p><hr />
