<br />
<br />The Video Amp has 5v DC going into the transistor, the base is grounded, then the emitter has a 33 ohm resistor going to video out and then also a 220 ohm resisor going to ground.

<br />It would be a no-no if you had it running past something creating interference, but doesn't sound like the true problem.
<br />
<br />How does that video amp compare to the original NES amp?  I get the impression it's just a hack job, and poorly designed circuit.  I which case it'll never work well (unless you never remove your finger).  Is there some reason you can't use the original video amp?  I'd do what you can to use that.
<br />
<br />I guess you could always just leave the alligator clip on there, it is in a toaster afterall <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A while ago (about a week ago) while I was modding my original NES for the audio mod (I was also trying to tweak the video circuit) I zapped 13v on the 5V circuitry of the console.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> 
<br />
<br />Of course it failed instandly. Because it has G revision chips all I would get was a solid gray screen. I knew it was busted. 
<br />
<br />I didn't panic though and went straight to the CPU -WRAM chip. Removed it and found it had two bits blown (D1 and D6) which effectively prevented the CPU from starting. Replaced it with another 6116 SRAM chip and the little beast was healthy again ! 
<br />
<br />
<br />What a relief !
<br />
<br />May this be of help for other unfortunate people who zap their NES or Famicom with such high voltages ...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
