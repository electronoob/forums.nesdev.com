<br />From what I've read and seen so far it looks like an amazing game It looks a little like Pokemon but with a more sci-fi edge to it. 
<br />
<br />here are some youtube vids of the game

<br />What Nintendo does affects Nintendo customers. What Disney does (i.e. lobbying Congress for <em>successive</em> extensions to the term of copyright) affects even non-customers. Imagine going to jail for a felony, and on the day you're ready to be released, you're sentenced to another consecutive 20-year prison term.

<br />
<br />On the other hand, all that is ancient history now that their power over the game industry is long gone. (though I doubt they would hesitate to revert to their former tactics if they were to re-claim their throne)
<br />
<br />But then again, so is Walt's personality, which seems to be enumerated as one of the diverse reasons for hating Disney in the link you pasted.
<br />
<br />I'm not saying you are wrong to pick your fights this way. I'm just saying there are lot of similar reasons for disliking Nintendo just as much. Yet, if someone on this forum would start to share his opinions on them in every thread where a product of theirs is mentioned, I bet people would start being annoyed pretty soon...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While I'm no fan of the modern Disney corporation, the linked article is pretty ludicrously psychotic if you read through it. Among other things, it regurgitates such old tropes as <a href="http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/aladdin.htm" class="postlink">"good teenagers take off their clothes,"</a> <a href="http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/lionking.htm" class="postlink">"S-E-X,"</a> <a href="http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/mermaid.htm" class="postlink">the phallus cover,</a> and <a href="http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/jessica.htm" class="postlink">Jessica's naughty bit's,</a> then went on to throw in several more batshit claims I couldn't find on Snopes, such as that Disney brainwashes its employees (no, really, they're claiming that their employee orientation constitutes mind control.) Example quote from another source, used in the article: ""Disney is one of the best deceptions of the Illuminati…"
<br />
<br />Disney has hardly been the pristine, immaculate business it portrays itself as, especially in recent years. And damn them, they do keep extending copyrights that should have expired decades ago. But this article is just friggin' black-helicopter ufo-brainwashing ludicrous.

<br />
<br />Because we're being brainwashed by Disney of course! It's a conspiracy I tell you!! Mickey Mouse and the Spectrobes are infiltrating our precious bodily fluids!!!
<br />
<br />Then again, maybe not...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Great page about Disney, thanks for the link!
<br />
<br />I enjoy reading stupid conspiracy theories like that alot. I can spend hours reading webpages by maniacs trying to convince people the Tunguska incident was really Tesla doing an experiment with wireless energy or how the government created the rumors about reported Elvis sightings just to be able to use it to discredit people who saw real UFOs (which ofcourse exist, but the government hides them from the public). "Yeah, and I bet Elvis was aboard too."
<br />
<br />Again, great find. Thanks.
