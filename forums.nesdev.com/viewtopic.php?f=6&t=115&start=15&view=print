<br />(First of all, mucho respect for ANYone who can even remotely understand how to rip an NSF. You are truly a king of kings. And I, I am the lowly peasant who likes to rock out to some sweet NES tune action. That's all.)
<br />
<br />Holy crap. This totally deserves an NSF. I can only assume that the reason it doesn't have one yet is because it's impossible or something. But damn, the Pro Bowl Music?! and the Super Bowl Music!? I mean, those are gems!

<br />
<br />Here I am again begging for someone to give Toobin a shot. Memblers tried and some kind of error screwed him up but he did find the music. You can ask him which part of the rom it's at if you need be. I'd love to get the music for this awesome but often over looked game. It'd be heavily appreciated and all that jazz.

<br />
<br />The Rollergames NSF is broken. It's missing the PCM, and it's missing a bunch of songs. Like the Level themes, the final boss, the ending, etc.

It appears that the order table got corrupted, and the parts of each track that are supposed to repeat don't repeat, causing the tracks to get out of alignment with one another. I have proof. If you want to hear this demonstrated, and you're willing to download 4.5 MB of .ogg and .nsf files, <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/BadTetrisNSF.zip" class="postlink">go right ahead</a>.
<br />
<br />I'd also like to see a re-rip of BPS's Tetris, the one where Down and A are swapped. It's missing at least "Technotris", based on Burgm√ºller's "Arabesque", which is my favorite track from that game.

I know it doesn't have THAT many songs... but still, it would be nice to listen to them rather then recording them from the sound card.

<br />Thanks if you can get back to me and do this.

<br />
<br />Just rename the .gif to .zip and extract. 
<br />
<br />This rip was a little tricky, and I had some trouble getting it to sound right so the above rip might not be completely accurate.

I tried both NSF files in my NSF debugger and it didn't notice any internal things that were odd (like accesses to unmapped memory, etc.).
<br />
<br />The first Puss 'n Boots first track was silent, and they all clicked at the beginning. I patched the init routine to add one to the track number and NOPed out the DMC ($4011) init to $7f since it doesn't seem to be used. Here's the patched track (in the same zip-in-gif format, heh):
