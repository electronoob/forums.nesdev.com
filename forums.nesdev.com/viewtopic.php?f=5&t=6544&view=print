		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was reading on another forum about the relative strength of handhelds versus their contemporaries on the console side, and it made me realize I really don't know much about the difference between the GB and NES.
<br />
<br />While tech specs are available all over the place, that doesn't always provide the whole picture.  For example, Wikipedia say that the NES has a 1.7~ MHz processor with a 5~ MHz PPU, while the GB is stated as having a 4.1~ MHz processor.  I didn't see anything about a PPU, did that single processor have to handle it all?  If so, what does this work out to as far as relative power?
<br />
<br />With the GB quoted as having 8k RAM and VRAM, coupled with no need for detailed color information and a much smaller screen...if it uses similar methods as the NES does for display, these aspects alone are much better than the NES.  And it could handle much larger cart sizes.
<br />
<br />Yet most games do not feel equal in terms of power and speed.  This could be due to developers unfamiliar with the technology, or B teams being put on GB projects, or perhaps some other hidden hangups that I don't know about.  Maybe they just made games slower so that the ghosting wouldn't be so bad!  And it's true that four color grayscale with smaller resolution makes it harder to capitalize on.
<br />
<br />What do you guys know about this?  If you had to compare the two, what are the main strengths and weaknesses, and why?

<br />Any cart-based system can handle infinite memory theorically.
<br />
<br />The GB has only 384 tiles, while the NES can handle 512. The NES has color (obviously) that the GB lacks.
<br />The GB has a built-in scan-line IRQ counter, and other reliable registers to synchronize with the rendering.
<br />
<br />The GB can handle a non-scrollable "window" which can act as a second BG layer WITHOUT any IRQ code. Combined with IRQ code, it can lead to awesome stuff as seen in Castlevania II (GB).
<br />
<br />The GB can write to VRAM during HBlank while the NES can only do that during VBlank, so there is more theorically possible crazy tile updating possible on the GB.
<br />
<br />The GB can handle 10 sprites per line instead of just 8, but has only 40 sprites instead of 64.
<br />
<br />Sound-wise, Channel 3 can play different waveforms (instead of just triangle), but Channel 2 has no hardware sweep, and the noise channel sound like crap compared to the NES (IMO anyway - it might just be me). There is no DPCM channel.
<br />
<br />Other than that (and the obvious CPU difference) both systems are really similar. The reason games feels so inferior is that they are made slow on purpose because of the crap LCD screen (fortunately the GBC fixed this).

<br />After all the LCD motion blur of the first Super Mario Land, I think I understand why games such as Super Mario Land 2 and Pokemon run at 30 fps or slower. Did games from the Super Game Boy era and later detect the SGB to enable 60 fps mode?

<br />
<br />Here's a sample routine I just made up to compare the GBZ80 with the 6502:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;GB code to XOR a small range of memory with FF<br />loop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ld a,&#40;hl&#41; ;8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;xor $FF&nbsp; ;8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;ldi &#40;hl&#41;,a ;8<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;dec c&nbsp; &nbsp; ;4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;jr nz,loop&nbsp; ;8<br /><br />;NES code to XOR a small range of memory with FF<br />loop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;lda mem,y&nbsp; ;4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;eor #$FF&nbsp; &nbsp;;2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta mem,y&nbsp; &nbsp;;4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;iny&nbsp; &nbsp;;2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;dex&nbsp; &nbsp;;2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;bne loop ;3<br /></div>
<br />
<br />So for this small example, the GB code is 36 cycles per iteration, while the NES code is 17 cycles per iteration.
<br />
<br />So GB is about half as fast per instruction, and it's clocked about twice as fast as the NES to make up for it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But the GBC in Double Speed mode probably is faster though maybe not by much than the NES CPU. Also I think GBC featured some kind of DMA.
<br />
<br />Back when GB was still going strong, I don't think I ever noticed the ghosting issue. Probably because I didn't play many of the fast paced games like Contra (Operation C). But I did awhile ago in modern times, try to play some on my GB Pocket. The ghosting blur was terrible and annoying me alot. It made the hard to see enemy projectiles and harder to see and the blurring itself is distracting.
<br />
<br />I don't own a GBC, and never tried GB games on a GBA so I don't know about their screens. But the GBA SP (original model) was/is ideal for playing older fast paced GB games. No ghosting issues to worry about.

<br />I'm not sure this is an improvement either, but that might be because I'm not familiar with the instruction set of the GB's CPU. On the NES, this automatic address increment saves a lot of time. Writes to VRAM could be slower if indexed addressing was necessary and if the index didn't match the one used for reading the data transfers would be much slower, since you'd have to maintain two pointers/indexes.
<br />
<br />I know that the Z80 has some block transfer instructions that could work well for this purpose, but I don't know if the GB's CPU kept them.
<br />
<br />I'm sure that technically the GB could have games as fluid as on the NES, but as a player I feel that most GB games are very slow. Maybe this is because of the LCD issue you guys mentioned. But even if this is the case, I see that a lot of games have something I hate: sprite and background misalignment. There seems to be some kind of delay that causes sprites to not properly follow changes in name table scrolling, which causes them to blend very badly with the background. I know some NES games suffered from that too, but it was much more common on the GB.
<br />
<br />In fact, another machine that appears to suffer from overall slowness if the Master System/Game Gear. A lot of games feel terribly laggy, and maybe in the case of games shared between both platforms it also had to do with LCD blur.
<br />
<br />The thing is that the GB combined with the SMS gives me a very bad impression of the Z80, almost like it can't keep up with fast-paced games. I know this is just an impression though, because even though this wasn't so common both platforms had really fluid games (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIsBHlODbOI" class="postlink">Daffy Duck in Hollywood</a> for example is a game that I find amazingly fluid on the SMS - the YouTube video doesn't even do it justice).

<br />I saw it in Wario Land. It was probably there because even the developers didn't notice it after having tested the game exclusively on the Game Boy's slow-@$$ LCD.

<br />You can have sprites and scrolling misaligned on ANY system.  This was just horrible programming.

<br />I know. I was just saying that for some reason this happens a lot in GB games, maybe because the effect is hard to notice on the blurry LCD, like tepples pointed out. It's still a pretty stupid mistake though.

<br />One disadvantage: SMS games have to do sprite tile flipping in software.
<br />
<br />Though Game Gear kicked Game Boy's behind in graphics, Game Boy redeemed itself in sound because of the Game Boy APU's far more varied waveforms. Sure, the SMS and Game Gear allow clocking looped noise from channel 3's frequency, but the Game Boy has a friggin' wavetable on channel 3.

<br />Probably because Sega ran a faster console cycle than its competitors. It put out SMS, MD, CD, 32X, Saturn, and Dreamcast, in the same time that the other company put out only three consoles. SMS was Sega's leading console in North America for barely over three years: June 1986 through August 1989 when Sega was promoting the Genesis with "Nintendon't" wisecracks. NES had nearly twice that time to mature: October 1985 through August 1991. Perhaps more of these "very interesting games" might have come out on Game Gear if it had actually had some battery life behind it.

<br />
<br />And Sega did really NOT care about sound at all (at least not for their first consoloes), having better graphics but crappy sound isn't really interesting to me - for me sound play a major part in a game, as much as graphics, and shouldn't be overlooked.
<br />
<br />And I don't think Nintendo claimed exclusivity - Double Dragon, Battletoads, Contra, Gradius, etc... were all released on multiple platforms and the NES. There is many many dual MSX/NES games from japan (although the NES version is the dominant one).
<br />
<br />Is the Gameboy CPU a Z80 ? I heard it was a 8080.

I heard it was a 8080.</div>
<br />The 8080 lacks several instructions that the Z80 has, like some of the bit manipulation / shift instructions, short conditional jumps etc.
<br />The GB CPU has many of those instructions that the 8080 lacks, but they've removed others (e.g. everything dealing with the IX/IY registers or I/O ports), as well as added a few of their own.
<br />And I've never come across an assembler targeted at the GB that used 8080 syntax.
<br />So I'd call it a simplified and customized Z80.
