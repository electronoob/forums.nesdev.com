		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, so the famicom adapter has a lockout chip, the NES system has a lockout chip, am I able to use the famicom adapters lockout chip to replace the original NES one? I know, I don't know need it lol.. but I'm trying to do something and I'd previously removed the 4th pin and it came OUT of the IC so I can't just solder on a workaround. I'm curious if I pull the famicom adapters lockout IC that if it'll work in the NES system under some logic that perhaps the pinout is the same and has the same functionality...? Not completely sure if it does. Both chips read 3193 but the NES is 3193A and the famicom adapter is just 3193, it makes me wonder if the functionality is slightly off from what the NES system would accept as a viable replacement. Any thoughts? Thanks guys.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Honestly? I had no idea games had lockout chips I could use to replace the one in the NES. I have cut a few boards and looked at them just now (was doing something else in them) and I do not see any 3193A or even 3193 (without the A) chips on the board. It is just SMB/Duck Hunt. Any suggestions on what game board I should be looking at for a lockout chip I can harvest without mucking up the famicom adapter would actually be appreciated because if I can avoid it, that is the preferred path of course. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

(Nintendo World Championships—very narrow distribution, Nintendo World Cup/Super Smash V'Ball—US only, Nintendo World Cup/Tetris/SMB—PAL only; all will sometimes fail to go back to the menu when you hit reset)<br /><br />You should be able to just cut pin 4 on the existing CIC, or if for some reason that doesn't work, there's a few threads here about other workarounds:<br />* <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=117410#p117410">viewtopic.php?p=117410#p117410</a><!-- l --> <br />* <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=98891#p98891">viewtopic.php?p=98891#p98891</a><!-- l --> (and <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=99226#p99226">viewtopic.php?p=99226#p99226</a><!-- l --> if you have one of the above three multicarts)<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 70%; line-height: normal">EDIT: explained the kind of reliance on CIC RESET OUT</span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The only advantages I can think of for having a lockout chip in your NES are:<br /><br />1. You want to demonstrate the lockout chip's function to someone.<br />2. You are building cartridges, and want to test that your CIC-equivalent is working.<br />3. You have one of the three cartridges mentioned above. [edit, didn't know about these]<br /><br />Unless doing one of these things, the lockout chip is purely a disadvantage to have in the machine, IMO.
