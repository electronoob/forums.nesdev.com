It's true those games looks awesome to say they are 16-bit - but I'm not into 1st person shooters anyway.<br /><br />And I'm sorry, but the sound on the MD is HORRIBLE. Those videos just reminded it to me the hard way. Any noise out of it just make my hears bleed. Perhaps it's those unfiltered very high frequencies that hurts my heardrums. Or it's just it remind me how MIDIs sounded on my very old pc - that is that they sounded like crap.<br /><br />About the graphic parts, it's true I exaggerated the difference, especially after viewing those videos. Let's say the SNES is supperior, having much more colors and more BG layers - but only a little supperior.<br /><br />Anyway it's games that are fun not the console - so no matter what are the system's possibilities, a good game on a lower system will always be better than a bad game on a higher system. In this sense, I fully respect that people might think their favorites MD games are the best. It's just that I'm into RPGs, and the SNES is <strong>THE</strong> conosle of RPGs. I'm sure someone will point me to MD RPGs, pehaps some good ones, but to be honest I'll likely not be playing them more than a few minutes.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I bet you like to bash the MD because you probably played a lot of SNES as a kid, and thought it was the most awesome thing ever back then, and only got to look at the MD recently (maybe even using emulators only), and of course under that perspective it will not look like much. I had a MD as a kid, but I played a lot of SNES at friends' houses and I always thought both consoles were very good.<br /></div><br />If 14-yo is being a kid, then yes you bet it. (as a younger kid I was playing PC and PS1 games).<br />Note that I don't say the MD is that much a bad console or wathever - I just want to point out that it IS technically inferior to the SNES, and significantly so. I'll amit any day that the MD is technically supperior to the NES, despite the fact I personally like the NES and NES games much better - I won't deny it.<br />Maybe a better example would be GBA vs PSP. When the PSP came out is was maybe 800 times supperior to the GBA in terms of graphics and sound. Nevertheless I always prefered the GBA console and games by a LONG way, but I won't try to find stupid arguments to prove the GBA's nonexistent technical superiority. I'd rather say that despite being technically inferior I just like it better and that's it. (note that I also prefer the GBA to the DS, because I still use my DS 70% of the time to play GBA games <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Aug 22, 2010 11:57 pm</p><hr />

Bregalad, I'll say again that I fail to see the "obvious" superiority of the SNES over the MD. You keep bashing the MD's sound, but I remember half of the SNES games I played sounding like shit because the sound was muffled as hell. A lot of these games sounded like they were played over a telephone or something. You might claim that "they weren't using the hardware right", but that doesn't change the fact that half of the games sucked on the sound department.<br /><br />I think both consoles were perfectly able to compete with each other, and there is no "obvious superiority" on either side. And they did compete side by side for a long time I think, without one console having to mandatorily kick the other's ass.<br /><br />I bet you like to bash the MD because you probably played a lot of SNES as a kid, and thought it was the most awesome thing ever back then, and only got to look at the MD recently (maybe even using emulators only), and of course under that perspective it will not look like much.

I certainly think Sega would have been better off with a number of different hardware decisions. Bump the MD up to 128 Colors from the start with 64 for BG and 64 for Sprites is just one. Another would have been to have instead of releasing the Sega CD as it was, cut out some of the extra stuff (like second 68000 cpu) and instead add a VDP that would function similar to the 32X's VDP overlay, only with the purpose to add either just sprites or bg layers with their own colors to boost colors that way. Another thing about the Sega CD is again I think they should have cut alot of the extra hardware in it and gone for a more PC-Engine approach where all the unit would be is a CD-ROM drive, with an upgradable Cartridge CD-ROM System Card. <br /><br />Then ofcourse I think they never should have released the 32X. And the Sega Saturn could have used a more thought out design that was less complex and easier for developers to put to use, like the PS1. Only thing I can complain about with the DreamCast is they should have known better than to let the system have such a terrible security issue. And I suppose also perhaps the 1GB Discs were not going to be enough in the long run.<br /><br />Despite these things though I do enjoy all of Sega's systems.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sun Aug 22, 2010 2:34 pm</p><hr />

So, in summary, it has been argued the MD's graphics are 100 times more limited than SNES', MD's FM sound sounds like a joke compared to SNES's Wavetable sounds (when the chip is used correctly, that is), and now we're debating whenever the MD's CPU is much faster, a little faster or not even any faster at all ?<br /><br />Anyway, even if it were this much faster, the SNES would still end up pushing the MD to shame. A faster CPU is good for computers, but for consoles, it's really the graphics and sounds that matters. Even today's action games typically doesn't handle more than a dozen of bullets and enemies on screen at a time - not much more than what was made in the 80's. (okay I'm not very knowledgeable about today's games so I might be missing something).<br /><br />And I didn't even talk about the controllers... The MD was originally made to compete with the NES (which it did quite well in fact !). But then the SNES came out and booom !<br />Sega's policy of releasing a new consolle every couple of years is weird, and what caused them to eventually go to their doom, instead of releasing better consoles less often. Yet I know the MD is Sega's best console and all, but hey... I just don't like Sega very much for some reason.

I left the other two subpalettes for enemies and objects. PCE original used 3 or 4 subpalettes for the BG total, for each area. And 4-6 for sprites.<br /><br /> <br /> As far as the whole 68k VS '816 thing, really.. little examples mean nothing. You can provide examples on both sides to show strengths and weaknesses. Try writing code for both. Optimize it for both. 8 or 9 times out of 10 (for game consoles and 2D gaming), ignoring clock differences, the '816 will come out ahead with less overall clock cycles. I done just that. If you're not getting similar results, well.. then you're not really efficient with coding on the '816 or 65x arch in general (would be my guess). LUTs and indexing in general is a huge strength of the 65x. And you play to the strengths of the processor. The difference between normal code and optimized code on the 68k, is not nearly as drastic in difference as it is on the 65x arch (65x= anything 65xx or 65xxx). Not to mention the 68k is the perfect CPU for a computer or operating system, but game consoles are more slimmed down and specific tasks. The requirement for the type of code is fairly different, and it's that difference that brings the differences or strengths between the two archs closer together, or rather.. eliminates some of the normally big benefits of the 68k design.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The 68000 beats the 65816 mainly at 32-bit calculations.

One thing I like to point out.<br /><br />It's 2010, FastROMs are dirt cheap nowadays.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd say in FastROM mode it is approximately 3.3 Mhz and it's about the same as a 5 Mhz 68000.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4383">psycopathicteen</a> — Sat Aug 21, 2010 6:55 pm</p><hr />

It's a benefit when you consider the predecessor chips were an 8-bit data bus with a 4 cycle access period. Pretty much the entirey of the 8080/8086 derivatives used that sort of bus, and the 6800 and it's children used a very similar one.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=8">ReaperSMS</a> — Sat Aug 21, 2010 5:09 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Perhaps the effective MIPS of the 65C816 needs to be lowered, as I'm guessing the average instruction will have a cycle of SlowRAM access.

You can't really say the SNES CPU runs at 3.58mhz since in not practical game program will it ever run that speed. That's the peak, not the average. I really do think it should be obvious that the 68000 @ 7.6mhz is going to be able to get more done than the 65c816 @ 2.68mhz ~ 3.58mhz. Not basing that solely on clock speed but more on how the processors work and just observing some commercial software for both platforms. <br /><br />The SNES obviously isn't pathetically slow to some point where it can't do anything. But I do think it's quite fair to say on the SNES you don't have as much cpu time to be wasteful with.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Sat Aug 21, 2010 4:54 pm</p><hr />
