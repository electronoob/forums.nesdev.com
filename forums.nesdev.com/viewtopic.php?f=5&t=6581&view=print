		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I want to try to disable speedStep to see if this is the cause that some emulators are jerky because of the constant CPU speed throttling but I cannot find how.
<br />
<br />I thought that closing the "super hybrid engine" that asus give would be enough but this software just control the maximum speed the CPU can be throttled so it doesn't help.
<br />
<br />I set the option to "always on" or desktop but still the CPU is throttled. I checked in the bios of my 1001px but cannot see any option about it.  
<br />
<br />There must be a way but for now I cannot find the information.  I will continue to search the web but if anybody figured out how to do it and have an answer or redirect me to some website that explain more on the subject I will really appreciate it.

<br />
<br />During lunch time I tested a few emulators and checked the speed with CPUZ and in some case (fce 2.1.1), the speed was staying at 1ghz and it was quite jerky. For nintendulator, if you overclocked (super performance in SHE), it was almost at 60 fps and cpu speed was at 1.7ghz instead of 1.6ghz.
<br />
<br />If that tool really work I will post my findings. thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Are you sure EIST is responsible for the problem?  RMClock will show you what capabilities the processor has, and which ones are actually in use (CPU-Z doesn't do this).
<br />
<br />EIST works surprisingly well, and given that, usually "choppy performance" means ACPI-based clock throttling is being used instead.  RMClock can help determine this as well, I believe.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know anything about RMClock yet.  I downloaded yesterday and the version on what seems to be on the original website date from 2008. It doesn't even recognize my cpu at all so I was concerned what it would do if I "tweak" my settings in those condition. So I didn't go forward for now (I was too tired too so I gave up yesterday).
<br />
<br />I will try to give it another go but I'm not sure were to check in the menu yet.
<br />
<br />As for CPUZ, at the least it was giving me the current speed but I couldn't find the same thing in RMClock.
