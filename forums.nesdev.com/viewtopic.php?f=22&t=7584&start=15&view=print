<br />As far as I understand it the dictionary doesn't need to be in RAM though.

<br />
<br />The dictionary is static. It is the 128 words of the input stream that are the most common (so 256 bytes). So when reading the input stream you read one byte, and if that byte's MSB is set, then bits 0-6 are the index into the dictionary / 2. If the MSB is not set, then bits 0-6 are the number of frames to hold the input byte for, and the next byte is the input byte.
<br />
<br />I never thought about doing a stack-based compression scheme. That could potentially give smaller results, but the implementation would be much more complex.
<br />
<br />I have thought of something that is going to prevent me from implementing this with a controller-port only application. The input data I have is in terms of frames, and I have no visibility to the frame start / end through the controller port. I'll have to rig something up with FCEUX to play and re-record the input movie in terms of what the input state is per strobe of the port or something.
<br />
<br />@thefox: Hey man, don't forget that there are many games (like SMB3) that read the control port multiple times per frame and wait until it's the same. You probably already thought of that though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />Yeah this shouldn't pose a problem.. The FPGA can keep track of elapsed frames by counting CPU cycles.

<br />
<br />Your FPGA magic is well over my head at this point, but I'll tell you what I was thinking about, maybe it will be of use to you.
<br />
<br />I was basically going to simulate the parallel-load serial shift register inside the controller using the AVR. I would just listen to the clock line.
<br />
<br />Anyhow, what would you think about a process that would run the input movie through the emulator and output a similar input stream but in terms of "times the controller port was strobed" instead of frames? Seems like that would reduce the complexity for both of our implementations.

<br />Yeah that should be easier to implement I guess (if I don't use the NMI way, which is kinda easier for me). I wonder how much it adds to the size of the compressed files?

<br />Many games do not strobe the controller ports during cut scenes, level / screen transitions, etc. So we should end up with fewer samples. Games like SMB3 that strobe multiple times per frame will always be reading the same input byte when on an emulator, so it should only add one to the repeat count.
<br />
<br />I don't know when I can work on this though. Seems like a big pain in the neck as I've never looked at the FCEUX source.

<br />Well, I can probably add this to Nintendulator. However first I need to figure out the Nintendulator movie format and how to convert FCEUX files to it...

<br />Unless they hit the DPCM double clock glitch. If they hit it on the second read, there might be four strobes in one frame: one pristine, a second with a deleted bit, and a third and fourth pristine.

<br />
<br />It seems like you could support playback of FCEUX files in Nintendulator. It's a dead-simple format if you ignore things like starting from a save state (which isn't terribly hard, you'd just have to convert it to the Nintendulator format on the fly) and movie text.

<br />
<br />I modified Nintendulator to output an NMI based controller log to a binary file. Now I just need to convert FCEUX movies to Nintendulator's format or modify FCEUX... or add FCEUX movie playback support in Nintendulator. I have a feeling it might be easiest to just convert FCEUX movies to Nintendulator's format. We'll see...
