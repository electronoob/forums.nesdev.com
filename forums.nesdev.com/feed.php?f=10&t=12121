Random question, but is your main code initialising S (e.g. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">ldx #$ff / txs</tt>) to something &quot;reasonable&quot;, i.e. somewhere in $01xx that doesn't conflict with local variable usage?  Otherwise your push/pulls could be essentially overwriting legit data.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Dec 11, 2014 4:43 pm</p><hr />

If it's not urgent, it's not urgent but without more code or a ROM I can't tell you why moving the joypad read outside the NMI works.<br /><br />I'd still recommend keeping it outside the NMI since your main loop isn't also in your NMI. (Or, that's the impression I'm getting.) The reason is that you're much less likely to miss button input if your game happens to lag for a frame with it at the start of the main loop. I had written a thing about the why of this and will still post it if you're interested. Boils down to NMI read means the player need only press a button for the input to be missed. Start of main loop means the player must press and release (or release and press) between the two main loops for the input to be missed. (It's tough to press a button for a single 60th of a second, and even if you manage it the input might STILL go through properly.) <br /><br />For the record, pretty Yoshi's Island suffers from a thing like this. Edit: I'm sure absolutely no one else cares, but apparently this isn't Yoshi's Island I'm thinking of. (Though Yoshi has a different quirk that will cause a missed jump on falling platforms.) I fear now I'll never know what game it actually was.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Thu Dec 11, 2014 3:39 pm</p><hr />

Hey all - thanks for the responses.  Yes, X is set to 8 before jumping to the routine.  I tried adding it just before the controller bytes loop just in case to the same ends.  It's a gremlin, for sure. <br /><br />Yes, RAM is cleared at reset prior to turning the NMI on, yet when this routine is called inside the NMI, the problem happens.  When I take it out of the NMI and just put it at the top of my game loop, there doesn't seem to be an issue.<br /><br />Just funky nonsense.  I'll keep tracking it down, but it's not a problem that has dramatic urgency.  Glad to know I wasn't the only one who ran into it!<br /><br />Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6590">JoeGtake2</a> — Thu Dec 11, 2014 2:49 pm</p><hr />

Ok, Ok, I'll explain.<br /><br />The RAM of the NES is a 2k SRAM chip, of 6116 type, which is somewhere on the NES' motherboard. This chip, just like any other SRAM chips, is made of SRAM cells, which is basically two logic inverters feeding back each-other.<br /><br />There is two stable states for this circuit, which correspond to '0' and '1' states. When writing to the SRAM, this forces the circuit into one of these states using an external voltage source. When reading the SRAM the output of the SRAM cell is simply amplified and read. When the SRAM cell is powered on there is no way to predict if it will become '0' or '1', because this will depend on how the internal details of the transistors that makes up the SRAM cell are made. Most of the time the data in the chip is random, but will always start at some given state.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Dec 11, 2014 1:40 am</p><hr />

I had this same problem once. To me it seemed like updating the controller too fast corrupts the value. I tried to replicate this for debugging by forcing my game to update the controller too fast, but I couldn't get it to work anymore. It may have been something else, but when I last time had this problem, placing the controller reading in NMI fixed it.<br /><br />Also, addition to what Kasumi said: when you reset your game, do you clear the memory? Not doing this can lead into issues on reset. The values would be #$00 when you turn on the console, but when you reset you don't know what is stored in memory. Clearing memory makes your game safer and it doesn't cost much time either.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6724">Tsutarja</a> — Wed Dec 10, 2014 1:14 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Any thoughts as to what could be causing this?<br /></div><br />If gamepad doesn't change between your start screen and your main loop, then sure, every button that was pressed on the start screen will be pressed for your main loop. If it happens with every button except A, I'd imagine something totally unrelated is clearing out A's bit. (Or a press of A simply has no effect on the first frame of the game for a different reason.)<br /><br />My game has a soft reset with A+B+Start+Select. It has a start screen that begins the game with a press of start. Reset zeroes out the buttons. So any button that was HELD on soft reset becomes a button press after the first joypad read. (Because the previously held buttons byte is now all clear.) It follows that that game began immediately after soft reset, because start is held down to do the reset, and then the start button hold becomes a press. To fix it, I just read the buttons again at the beginning of the start screen. This made all button presses button holds before the check for a press of start happened. <br /><br /><br />Where do you check buttons in your main loop? I can't suggest anything without knowing when your buttons are read in the main loop and the start screen. For you it sounds like you'd need another read in between your start screen and main game.<br /><br />Edit: I might also be misunderstanding the problem. So... is it that your game begins immediately with no button presses when you check any button that's not A? Do you clear out your button RAM before the game begins? And are your button reads in your NMI? <br /><br />Edit2: And for super completeness, how is X set up in the gamepad read subroutine? Because I don't see it set up there. I'm pretty sure if you read $4016 more than 8 times (and no special hardware is plugged in), you get nothing but set bits. So if you're reading it more than 8 times, that could be it too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3504">Kasumi</a> — Wed Dec 10, 2014 1:00 pm</p><hr />

This is something that went unnoticed until now.  I have a controller reading routine that seems to work just fine.  It's this:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent"><br />GamePadCheck:<br />      LDA #$01<br />      STA $4016<br />      LDA #$00<br />      STA $4016<br />ReadControllerBytesLoop:<br />      PHA<br />      LDA $4016<br />      AND #%00000011<br />      CMP #%00000001<br />      PLA<br />      ROR<br />      DEX<br />      BNE ReadControllerBytesLoop<br />      STA gamepad<br />      RTS<br /></div><br /><br /><br />This has worked with no issue.  The controller behaves exactly as it should, with some defines.  Up, down, left, right, select, start, b and a all function appropriately during gameplay.<br /><br />The problem - I have set up a placeholder start screen.  For a while, i've just had it where a press of the A button jumps to the game loop.  This has worked no problem - it loops through the start screen code until A is pressed and then jumps to the main game loop.  I finally got around to updating that to the 'start' button, and now it acts as if the start button is pressed at the start of the game and launches right to the main game loop.  In fact, this happens for EVERY button except the A button.<br /><br />Again, the buttons work correctly during game play, but it almost seems as if they are being 'activated' for a frame at the start of the game without an actual press, jumping out of the start screen loop prematurely....all of them except for the A button, which works as expected on the start screen.<br /><br />Any thoughts as to what could be causing this?<br /><br /><br /><br />***** When I pull a jump to this routine OUT of my NMI and call it at the top of the start screen loop, that seems to solve the problem...I still don't like not knowing why, if anyone has any thoughts*****<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6590">JoeGtake2</a> — Wed Dec 10, 2014 9:59 am</p><hr />
