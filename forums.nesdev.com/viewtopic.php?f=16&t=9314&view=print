I have tried to get a &quot;new&quot; password by clicking &quot;forgot your login details?&quot; in the wiki, but that didn't work either (it tells me that a &quot;reminder has been sent&quot;, but I didn't receive any such reminder - this might be another bug aside from the account creation problem).<br /><br />If it's impossible to repair the &quot;nocash&quot; wiki account, could you <strong>please</strong> create a new account for me? Username &quot;nocash123&quot; and email same as in the old account, or alternately use the other email address that I've PM'ed to tepples &amp; WhoaMan. If that's working then I'll be happy with it. If it doesn't work then we do at least know that the account creation still doesn't work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think there's any reason to make a new account; I do not think the issue has anything to do with your specific account.  I think the issue may have to do with the MediaWiki configuration needing some config directives changed/set to work with the mail infrastructure that the new server now uses.<br /><br />The same issue/complexity applied to the phpBB software here for the forum, as the mail infrastructure/bits used on the new server are significantly different (uses Google Apps) than when hosted on Parodius (we ran our own SMTP services).  You can see confirmation of that fact <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=9181&amp;p=97562#p97562" class="postlink">in this sticky</a>.<br /><br />Bottom line: let WhoaMan work it out please.  Patience.  :-)

It wasn't sent via email, but manually via PM.<br />Emailing might be still a problem for future account creations... but at least there's a way to get around it.<br /><br />Now I can login to the wiki - but can't edit pages because I am not in the &quot;trusted&quot; user category! Can somebody please change that?<br /><br />Btw. WhoaMan told me he can't get me the &quot;trusted&quot; status because he has no admin account on the wiki. How can you expect him to do the admin work without giving him an admin account? Can somebody please change that, too? At least, it seems to me... that he can't even test his account creation bugfixes without having admin rights. Or am I mistaken there?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When things were hosted at Parodius, the Wiki was managed by tepples, Banshaku, and occasionally myself.  phpBB was managed by a multitude of people.  Things are different now.  The server move and so on still has a lot of things that need to be taken care of, and this is one of them.  There are multiple levels of access we're talking about here (system root access vs. wiki access vs. access levels within the wiki) and they're all separate.  This is just how things are.<br /><br />I'll update this post when I've had a chance to fix stuff up.<br /><br />Edit: I've added you to the trusted group, and it looks like (from wiki edits) that WhoaMan already figured out how to add himself to the appropriate sysop and bureaucrat levels in the Wiki.  There is a separate moderators-only topic where we're discussing changing things to make things easier (for ourselves as well as folks who want to do wiki editing in the future).

That troubles are to be expected when switching to a new server and new mail protocol, and as WhoaMan wasn't involved in the old server, it'll be twice as difficult for him to figure out what needs to be changed.<br /><br />Okay, the wiki editing is no working for me. Big thanks to tepples, WhoaMan, and koitsu for creation &amp; password &amp; unlocking!
