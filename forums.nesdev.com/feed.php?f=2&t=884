This project + nesasm = bad. Use an assembler like wla-dx, it's better for this kind of thing. And you should try and remake some of this stuff your self. Not everything is just drag and drop on a computer, you actually do have to do some of it by hand. I'm remaking FFVII for the NES (Don't tell anyone outside of NESdev that!) and I have to make the engine, all formats, and stuff. Bregalad is doing the sound, though. And I'd avoid NERD tracker for these types of projects. I think I may write my own sound editor for other projects, because NerdTracker is full of bugs, and I could never get it to make a usable NSF. If I were you, I'd just write all formats to everything, so you know EXACTLY what's going on, and how. And you should write your own sound engine. It's really not that hard to write an engine. It may sound like a pain in the ass, but it's really not, when you know what you're doing. I'm not too far in the engine for FFVII, but I am sorting everything into memory, because that's what is most important, becuase this is a HUGE project, and before I actually use data to load data, I have to figure out where everything is in memory. You should figure out how every thing will be sorted into memory before you start. If you are using a Mario 3 level editor, make sure you know how to load it into a ROM. I'd suggest actually writing your own format. I'd suggest writing all formats, like I've said before. It's really not that hard if you know what you're doing. My advice now, is if  you do not know what you are doing, turn back and read 6502 documents, and learn what you are doing before you start doing it! I hope you do know what you are doing. Really, I'm going to say it again, you should come up with formats for EVERYTHING. And yes, YY-CHR is the best graphics editor in my opinion. Everyone else prefers TLayer Pro, but not me. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: I see you say you are using 6502.txt and stuff as help files. This is not good. Read them, and learn 6502 before you even think to start this project. It's an easy language to learn, really. with only like 20 somethin' keywords, you can do alot. But do not come bareling into this project. Take it slow. Really.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Jan 01, 2006 11:24 pm</p><hr />

DO NOT USE DOS PROGRAMS.  You have more memory than dos supports.  At least use freebasic.<br /><br />I'm just speaking because I've been badly burned from qbasic.  One time, I misused poke and overwrote my program in memory, another time I hit the maximum code size wall, and couldn't add any more code, or even run or save the file.  Even though I'm a former qbasic fanatic, the Zelda 2 editor was way too much for it to handle.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sun Jan 01, 2006 1:12 am</p><hr />

Well, once you come up with a format, you will want to use DB statements, or incbin a data file that you make by hand with a hex editor. Maybe DB statements would be best. That's what I do when I come up with formats, I do a DB statement, and see if my format works. Then I say, "Cool! I want to make a level editor! Crap! I don't know C completely! Or ANY C++ besides the cout statement! And Qbasic is easy to learn, but I don't have time! I'm pissed!". But that's what I'd suggest. Come up with a format, test it, make sure it works, and make a level editor that will make a binary file that'll use your format, and you'll be able to incbin it into your code. If you make a level editor, remember, it doesn't have to be user friendly! This is nice! Other people won't be using your level editor, hopefully. If they are, then you'd have to make it user friendly. But I'm going to stop talking, cause I have to go.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh by the way, if you use anything DOS related, I'd suggest QBASIC. It's really well, basic, but it's good for making cheap level editors.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Dec 31, 2005 11:46 pm</p><hr />

I'll concur with blargg: The point of the PC-side exercises is that making a level editor and replayer will force you to become intimately familiar with the workings of the SMW engine, and the PC's "OMG 3 GHz" brute force will let you concentrate on understanding without running into efficiency barriers.<br /><br />But no, Celius, the PC-side exercises don't have to be in C++.

The idea is that one's (possibly inflated) sense of one's skill will be tempered by the experience of trying to code the game on a platform where efficiency and memory usage restrictions are almost non-existent. To make a game of this type also requires level editor tools, which pretty much must be done on a PC.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Dec 29, 2005 8:37 pm</p><hr />

One thing that bothered me when I entered NESdev is that I guess I was supposed to know C, or C++. I still only have half mastered C, and I'm doing just fine with NESdev. What if what's-his/her-toes doesn't know C/C++? I think she/he can do fine with just 6502, and doesn't exactly NEED to make a SMW clone run on a PC. Was that what you even meant? Like a C/C++ recode of SMW? I will not continue rambling until I know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Dec 29, 2005 5:37 pm</p><hr />

There will be a lot more data than code, do you have a way to edit the levels and maps?  If you have all the needed tools and at least some of the data organized, you shouldn't have much trouble attracting a coder to the project, heheh.<br /><br />The code couldn't be too bad, not real simple, but mostly doable on NES.  Some stuff would probably need to be changed to keep any slow-down out of the game.  Keeping in mind the SNES CPU runs 1.5 times faster than NES (besides the 16-bit stuff) and the NES CPU will also have to handle the sound engine.<br /><br />For showing how to write a platform game, the Programming MC Kids article is pretty nice.  MC Kids is fairly similar to SMW also.<br /><a href="http://greggman.com/mckids/programming_mc_kids.htm" class="postlink">http://greggman.com/mckids/programming_mc_kids.htm</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Dec 29, 2005 4:50 am</p><hr />

You've made nothing yet? Do not make the same mistake I did. Do not come barreling in to NESdev. Have you any experience in game programming at all? You do know the 6502? Make tech demos before commencing this project. What I suggest is making tech demos for every element of the game. Make a tech demo for the level design, make one for collision detection, etc. State your real status in programming. When I came here, I didn't even know like anything about programming. So there's no need to feel dumb. I was asking how to scroll when I came here, and I didn't even know the 6502.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Wed Dec 28, 2005 11:42 pm</p><hr />
