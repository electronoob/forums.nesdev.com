		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Two days ago, I planned out a music engine that was very very simple. It was so simple that I made the whole thing yesterday. However, upon looking at it, I realized that it was quite space-consuming. It also didn't allow for things like vibrato without taking up a million bytes. The B flat scale consumed about 33 bytes for the triangle wave's part. To me, that sounds like a HUGE waste of space. They are also all the same length (Making the lowest and highest notes twice as long would have added about 6 bytes). So I'm going to kind of do away with that idea.
<br />
<br />So I want to make a new music engine where the music data takes up less space, and allows for things like vibrato and sweeps. I see that 33 bytes for a B flat scale looks really big for such a small thing, but I don't really have a good idea of how big a <em>song</em> should be. So about how many kilobytes (or bytes) would you say a one-minute-long song with lots of dynamic that loops over and over take up in a good music engine?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I already wrote a sound engine that allows a lot of effects including vibrato and sweeps, it only lacked better enveloppe control, a few optimisation here and here and arpeggio. I already send the source to you back then so you should have an idea how to store music while keeping the byte count as low as possible.
<br />
<br />I also have a simpler and more space efficiant music engine than the one I sent to you, but it doesn't allow for vibratoes and only allows hardware sweeps (wich can lose precision as opposed to software ones), and that allows relatively basic volume control. However, this simpler music replayer take very few space on the ROM, I'm using it on my current project where I want to avoid any PRG bankswitching. If you prefer this version I could give you the source and doccumentation of it.

<br />
<br />That would be really really helpful. I would really appreciate it  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .
<br />
<br />So Bregalad, I looked at your sound code, and the data for the channels looks pretty big, but maybe that's just because I don't have a good idea of how big music should be. But both of the songs have tons of dynamic, so it looks like it'd take up way less space than my engine. Does music generally take up a lot of space?

<br />
<br />It's not much help to know how much space 1 system takes up when you're not planning to use that system. A lot of the oldest NSFs have been cut down to 3KB, with the header, the code, and the music itself in the file. Other games, like Maniac Mansion, are at the other end of the spectrum taking up 100+ KB of space total.
<br />
<br />Pick something to work with, then figure it out using a couple of examples.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The largest NSF I found is Dragon Warrior 4, wich is 104 KB (however maybe the dump contains information that isn't vital to sound code).
<br />
<br />I don't think you can do much better than one byte per note, one nybble for the lenght and one nybble for the note itself. Plus a few bytes to give the sound code some information. With my system you can repeat a bunch of data, and have two levels among the code (so you can have a track "call" a subtrack just like a programm call a subroutine). I don't know how helpfull this really is, but it can save space here and there. Finally you may want to apply a general-purpose compression algorithm to the whole song to reduce the size even more (but you'd have to decompress the whole song into RAM before playing it, so forget about if if you don't have SRAM, or else you'll only be able to play very small songs). Any scale should be 12 bytes wide (not 33 as you mentionned) regardless if you play the first and last note longer.
<br />
<br />Many other formats come up with two bytes per note (which is bad I think) or with a pattern system, where the song just change instuments and call patterns wich only contains notes (wich is good, but maybe not always optimal and not always flexible). NT2 works with the last one, while MCK works with the first one (trus wasting a really big amount of ROM per song).

So I won't waste space if I'm playing the same thing over again. I'll also be able to use bit 7 of the note to check for dynamic changes and stuff. I'll have to think some more. You're right Bregalad, you really can't get better than a byte per note. That I'll keep in mind.

<br />If I remember right, NT2 header is about 52 bytes, NT2 .dat is a 16 byte instrument header, 2 bytes per order table entry, and 3 bytes per distinct pattern (offset + length), NT2 order table data uses 4 bytes per row.
<br />NT2 pattern data uses 4 bits per row, 8 bits per note, 4 bits per instrument, 4 bits per effect with parameter 00, and 12 bits per effect with positive parameter.

<br />
<br />However I wouldn't really sweat it too much when it comes to writing a sound engine.  Famitracker and Nerdtracker both get by pretty well, unless you have some other specific need for your own.

It's done with the square wave, and I have to say, it's quite impressive. I don't see it being done with NT2 or FamiTracker, however. I'll be making a game that will have many sound effects like that, so if I were to use NT2, I'd have to handle sound effects myself.

<br />
<br />Unfortunately no (AFAIK, I haven't worked with the lastest Famitracker engine).
<br />
<br />What works though is to change all sound register writes in the music engine so they write to a buffer in RAM, then you can easily interrupt any channels for a sound effect.

<br />It's true that Konami's sound effects often rock, due to their usage of hardware seeps for Square channels. Capcom sound effect are often great too.
<br />I once reverse-enginereed the sound code of Dragon Quest I (it was incredibly simple), and Just Breed (this one was really insanely complicated). I think I lost my notes about them, I'm not completely sure. They also used the note/command thing.

In the bytes that define notes, I only have bit 7 open (There are less than 128 notes in the table), but I can still use that to indicate dynamic changes. I want to refrain from defining things more than once as much as I can. I want to be able to make the Bb scale take up VERY little over 15 bytes (The Bb scale consists of 15 note changes). I'll come back once I have everything planned out.
