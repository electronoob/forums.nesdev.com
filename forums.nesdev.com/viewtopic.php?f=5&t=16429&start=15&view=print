		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Mobo manufacturers not updating BIOS beyond a year or so is a bummer (or just updating it for fixes, not forward cpu recognition) I wonder if there's a difference between companies like Dell, HP, Intel that have made boards for their own lines of workstations and desktops on one hand, and general purpose manufacturers like gigabyte. All are probably driven by wanting customers to buy their latest, but maybe the later category is somewhat more reliant on 'enthusiasts' rather than companies that just replace their office equipment every other year. <br /><br />I guess the safest bet is to look at the date of manufacture on the latest revision, or a quick reference/chart/spec.

I guess it would be more correct to say there are 29 address lines connected between the CPU and chipset, and a bunch of control signals that replicate the functionality of three more address lines.<br /><br />Either way, you're never getting more than ~3.25GB of usable RAM from a 945G chipset.
