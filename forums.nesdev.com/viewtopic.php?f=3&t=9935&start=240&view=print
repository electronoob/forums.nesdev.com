		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm working on Astyanax and it is annoying that the same tile is reused at different location in the single large image in cut scenes. So I'm thinking about the script feature. The primary use of the script is to allow the emulator to identify a tile and palette being use in different situations and apply a different HD tile to it. So there are several steps to this:<br /><br />1. Find out if a specific tile and palette is being used by searching the name table, attribute table and OAM.<br />2. Find out how the tile is used: e.g. location on screen, values in RAM or variables used by the script.<br />3. Tag a number to that entry in the name table or OAM. A specific HD tile is previously added to the graphics pack for that particular tile, palette and tag combination.<br />4. When the emulator renders that tile, it will use the specific HD tile instead of the default one.<br /><br />For example many tiles are repeated in the title screen of Super Mario Bros. For a particular tile on the screen, the script can find the location of the tile to identify it. However the screen will scroll as the demo starts and so we need to subtract the horizontal scroll value of the map to find out the real location of the tile. Then we tag a number to that tile. Better still, if we know we are in the title screen and the horizontal scroll value, we can immediately identify each entry in the name table and tag them in a loop.<br /><br />Let's use the standing of Mario as another example. If we can find out whether Mario is standing still, we can start a frame counter and tag the OAM according to the counter to show Mario breathing like in some fighting games. We can also find out the direction that Mario is facing to have more detailed rendering as suggested in an earlier post.<br /><br />So the emulator needs to provide the following functions:<br />1. Read from name table,  attribute table and OAM.<br />2. Tag a number to name table and OAM.<br />3. Read from RAM.<br />4. Some memory for the script to read and write and the values written persist across frames.<br />5. A search function to find the existence of a tile.<br />6. The script will run once per frame<br /><br />Is that enough to make it work?

Alex Douglas who did some tests on SMB2 reports that the new version of HDNES runs faster and smoother, allowing for real gameplay (if not recording) at 4x on his computer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />An alternate idea is to have it possible to mark tiles that are next to each other as a whole. Mario standing is 8 tiles total (2x4) but instead of replacing each tile by itself it replaces it as a whole 64x128 sprite (@ 4x). And then multiple tiles that are used twice can be replaced as well because it's seen as it's own separate object.<br /><br />Using HEX values from the pattern table in this example.<br />----------------<br />| $00 | $01 |<br />----------------<br />| $4C | $4D |<br />----------------<br />| $4A | $4A |<br />----------------<br />| $4B | $4B |<br />----------------<br />That's Mario standing.<br /><br />Mario's second(?) walk frame is this.<br />----------------<br />| $00 | $01 |<br />----------------<br />| $02 | $03 |<br />----------------<br />| $04 | $05 |<br />----------------<br />| $06 | $07 |<br />----------------<br /><br />As you can see the top 2 tiles are the same while everything else is different. Now if we made it one whole object that is replaced you could edit the top of Mario's head as well and not worry about the tile being used somewhere else unexpectedly. Selecting the tiles to group together could be as simple as clicking and dragging on the captured frame in the editor and pressing a button saying &quot;mark as object&quot;! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I've noticed people prefer/expect to use composite sprite sheets for sprite editing and doing it this way would make those edits usable.<br /><br />Example with graphics.<br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, both evgeny's and GGuy's ideas are good ideas that I haven't thought of. But I think there is a limitation that the whole object must be in the name table or OAM in order to get recognized. That means it won't work for objects in scrolling background or sprites that can more out of the screen. And for sprites, all the tiles must be placed in consecutive entries OAM, otherwise it will be hard to tell when there are several instances of the same meta sprite flying all over the screen.

I don't know how it works exactly because I'm not a programmer but it might be possible with your scripting system mkwong.<br />Good luck with this however you decide to implement your alternate tile replacement script. It's a much needed feature.<br /><br />edit: typo

(RAM adress and value)<br />for example: if RAM $0010=1 then draw tile variant 2, else default.<br />Maybe use optional  RAM, ROM, VRAM, CHROM adresses for check, then anybody can select use pallete or NameTable or game level or anything else as indicator for individual tiles. Also selection custom for byte, word, or double word as value for this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now that I think about it, the meta-sprite idea may actually work well enough in most cases if I add a restriction to it. The restriction is that the the meta-sprite must be a strip of tiles, so that a big object will be composed of a few vertical or horizontal strips of tiles. If an object only move into the screen from left or right edge, then we can break the object down into vertical strips. This way, we still have the whole meta-sprite to work with even when only part of the object is on the screen. This will also simplify the detection algorithm as it is much simpler to match a strip of tiles to a known pattern.
