I have trouble seeing on my laptop if the colour on the water reflection is ok or horrible. But I think it will be something roughly along these lines until other requirements demand cutdowns. <br /><br />I tried to follow this rule for possible level mechanics this time:<br />2x2 tile platforms are proper solid, 1x with 90 degree corners are jump/drop-through solids, stuff that's just a thin cliff or the like is suppes to be air/background.</div><br />What we actually need at this point is this image running on actual hardware.  What's often not taken into consideration when drawing graphics on the NES is what the end result looks like under NTSC on an actual TV.  The difference can be substantial.  The closest thing we can do (without an actual NES ROM of this) is to use <a href="http://slack.net/~ant/libs/ntsc.html#nes_ntsc" class="postlink">blargg's ntsc filter library</a> to see what the results &quot;might&quot; look like.<br /><br />Are the above graphics available in any kind of format that's generally compatible with the NES, e.g. name table + attribute table + pattern table + palette data?  If so, I can probably throw together a ROM of it.  I can get video output from an actual NES as well.  Tepples' Graphics Editor should be able to do all this with ease (and I'm happy to put in the time).  In fact, since the source image is PNG, I think I can do it now...  I'll give it a shot.

This is one of several reasons why an artist seeing their work on real hardware (or as close as possible -- blargg's stuff is pretty damn accurate) is important.

In general, though, this is to be expected when you go between different TVs and monitors, relative contrast of colours is going to vary a lot.<br /><br />Brightness is consistent up and down a single hue column, but when you're mixing colours on the same row especially, different TVs will shift the brightness of various hues up and down. It won't be a robust relationship.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think there's anything about it that warrants &quot;avoid at all costs&quot;. I mean, most graphics will still look &quot;fine&quot; if you put them on different TVs, even though the balance of hues is different. The question is really how much worse it will look, which depends one how you use it.<br /><br />The problem is when you spend a lot of time trying to get even colour balance on your personal version of the colours, you will end up making art that starts to look bad as soon as that subtle balance is disrupted.<br /><br />A lot of games go with &quot;monochromatic&quot; palettes. Many Mega Man games tend to use only 1 hue column for a single tile or sprite (and/or black/white). This is very robust because you're avoiding the hue balance problem entirely. The tradeoff is obvious though: missing out on potentially interesting colour combinations.<br /><br />If you go into it with the right expectations, mixing hues is not verboten. Just try to test it out in different environments sometimes. Stick it in an emulator that has hue/brightness/contrast/sharpness controls, for example, and see how it stands up.<br /><br /><br />NES music has a similar problem: if your mixing relies heavily on subtle balance of volume (especially with Famicom expansion sound), as soon as you take it to another machine with different balance, the mix falls apart. On the other hand, if you write in a way that can tolerate various channels being a little louder or softer, you get a result that will sound well on many machines. I think this is one of the reasons Bach's music turns up in video games so often; his style of contrapuntal writing doesn't rely on balance like that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Like, I often see <a href="http://zxspectrum48.i-demo.pl/zxgallery_pliki/Rion-Unreal.png" class="postlink">ZX Specrum</a> art using rainbow colours, and I think the reason is basically that because it only has two brightness levels for any given colour, hue is being used as a substitute for finer brightness control.<br /><br />The same phenomeon happens on the NES. The granularity of brightness is quite limiting, and it's tempting to use hue to compensate; but as just stated, this is unreliable. It's basically... the NES is a low precision machine in this respect. If you try to make distinctions that are smaller than its level of precision, they just aren't going to hold up well. Hue distinctions that are stronger than the basic granularity of precision will still work fine, if you understand what I mean.<br /><br /><ul><li> choosing three colours &quot;vertically&quot; so there is no change of hue: this works fine, the NES should always be consistent (i.e. monotonic brightness) within a column</li><li> choosing three colours &quot;horizontally&quot; so there is no change of brightness: the imprecision of the system will cause different hues to stand out more depending on whose machine it is.</li><li> choosing three colours &quot;diagonally&quot; so there is a change of hue and brightness at the same time: this usually works well because it is not relying on hue or brightness alone.</li></ul><br />I think the worst problem is caused by semi-horizontal colours. Like, if you take two colours from row 1 and a third colour from row 2, and expecting one of those &quot;hues&quot; to be in between the other two in brightness. I see people try this a lot when they're given an &quot;NES palette&quot; and assume it's going to look the same everywhere.

I suppose PAL has the same problems too for the same reasons. I could either make it black if i wanted it to be more sturdy, or experiment with wider/tigher hues, or come up with something different, but i'm stuck with the file problem atm. <br /><br />I've tried a couple of things to get nesst to open the session now, but nothing gives so far.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I reproduced the bug, and my suspicion was correct: savtool currently 1. does not support source images that are RGB as opposed to using a colormap, and 2. produces a traceback instead of a comprehensible warning if the user attempts to convert a file that is RGB.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$ file test3-256x240.png <br />test3-256x240.png: PNG image data, 256 x 240, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced</div><br />I opened <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">test3-256x240.png</tt> in GIMP and noticed that <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">convert</tt> had scaled it down with anti-aliasing, which distorts colors on edges. When reversing magnification of pixel art, use point sampling, also called nearest neighbour. So I opened the original PNG in GIMP, converted it to indexed color, and scaled that down to 256x240 pixels with nearest neighbour.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$ file greco.png<br />greco.png: PNG image data, 256 x 240, 4-bit colormap, non-interlaced<br />$ ./savtool.py greco.png greco.sav &amp;&amp; ls -l greco.sav &amp;&amp; ./savtool.py --show greco.sav<br />-rw-rw-r-- 1 pino pino 8192 Apr 20 23:53 greco.sav<br /></div><br />Because I did not provide a 32-hex-digit palette string, it used the default (grayscale) palette.
