I was particularly thinking of Skrybe when I made my last post about Lost Levels.  In fact, I almost mentioned him, but figured it would be in bad taste without consulting him first.  But, there you have it.  <br /><br />You can trust Skrybe...he is is very good at dumping stuff and has done so for many other prototype owners, some of which made the same request of secrecy as you.<br /><br />In fact, he just did a redump of my one-of-a-kind NES Mickey Mouse III proto.  I, however, am releasing the rom to the public, value of my cart be damned.    I personally think all roms should be shared when they are old enough, but respect completely when folks don't want to.  When someone doesn't want to share a rom, the next best thing is to at least back it up, so you are doing the right thing.  When backing up a proto that isn't going to be released, at least the community can give a sigh of relief that a game is safely backed up somewhere, even if they don't get to play it.<br /><br />-Rob<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=200">rbudrick</a> — Thu May 10, 2007 8:51 am</p><hr />

Back to the original issue:<br /><br />mrmark0673, I can't help you get a CopyNES, but if your only concern is getting that proto copied, I can dump it for you if you're willing to lend it to me.  rbudrick here at nesdev and TheRedEye and DreamTR at DP can all vouch for me.  It'd be nice if you were willing to release the rom, but I won't give it to anyone if that's what you want.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=635">Skrybe</a> — Wed May 09, 2007 1:26 pm</p><hr />

Prototype versions sometimes have a level select menu and other cheats designed to help testers.  These cheats were often (though not always) taken out of the final version.  In addition, sometimes early versions of games have bugs that can be fun to exploit (see my signature).  I am particularly thinking of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for N64, whose earliest released version had some fun glitches that were partially or completely fixed in newer revisions.  A prototype would, in theory, have more bugs which can even further "enhance" gameplay (although the bugs can also ruin it, depending on their nature).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Tue May 08, 2007 11:31 am</p><hr />

For the proto, I really definitely don't care myself, since whathever the game is, I can download the final version of it anytime, and it will be even better, because the devloppers have made the changes they estimated they needed to improve it, so the final version is SUPPOSED to be better. Then why is the prototype worth $10000000 and shouldn't be dumped when the final, better version is worth $4 and should be dumped ? I also imaginate the label on the cart is much better on the final version, and if you're lucky you could find a boxed/manual version with artwork, wich is even better.<br /><br />I still cannot imagine why one would his game to be dumped for his own self and wouldn't want anyone to potentially share this data. You know, when I'm downloading a ROM and that I've to chose between the prototype version or the final version, I download the good dump of the final version without an instant of hesitation, because it is presumbaly better. However, the goal of ROMs is to have anyone play any version of any game at any time without paying or anthing, with the only contraint that this in not on the real hardware, wich is to me a serious inconvenient.<br />Then I really don't see the point of thinking "Hahahahaha I'm the only one to have that precccciousss game (like Gollum) hahahaha and noone even has a ROM of it hahahahaha".<br />Reading what you said, you could as well have the revision A version of SMB3, love it as a child, and then would you pay a ridiculous amount of cash to play the original revision of SMB3 and read "Miss twice and your out" instad of "You can only miss twice" ? That makes no sense.<br /><br />Not to mention I could fake any prototype of any game and sell it $1000000 and be rich for my whole life heheheh (no just kidding).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue May 08, 2007 9:30 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I might be going out on a limb but it sounds almost like you expect special treatment.  You could have just said "please help me dump my NES game" and avoided this. If you never release it regardless of whether you preserve it for yourself, what good is it to anyone, just the satisfaction of helping a guy protect his personal investment in the holy name of preservation? While that may work in the collecting scene, put bluntly, shiny things are often not quite as impressive to the developers as they are to the collectors. So please try to see through my (our?) practical point of view.<br /></div><br /><br />I understand your point, but I was just interested in buying a device to help get things done myself.  I Don't see how giving money to developers on this board is a bad thing, although looking back I clearly could have stated things differently to get myself out of this trouble.  I'm sorry if you thought I was looking for some handout here where someone could dump a cart for me that I would keep for myself and get nothing in return for it, that to me would be a selfish act.  I meant no harm in the original post, I was just looking to see if there was anyone on these boards that could help me out.  I assumed this was like many of the other NES boards I frequent as I know many of the members on those boards come here, but clearly I was mistaken.  Most of you have strong (similar) views on the matter and I respect that.  I could do something like a collective pool to dump the game, but I don't see much sense in that either.  I have no intention of making a profit on this game, and being that there are so few differences in this game than the final release, I assume no one on here would even care to play it.  How many of you honestly get enjoyment out of playing a game that is just like another game except for a few name changes and spelling errors?  Well to me, it was worth it.  It marks a period of time where my favorite game was being developed and I think that is pretty cool, its almost like a piece of history.  Anyway, I respect your point of view, but I do disagree with it to some extent.  I believe the rights of the item should belong to the person who purchased it as it was available to anyone who would have liked to make an offer on it.  If I could dump the ROM and assure myself that I didn't throw away the $300 I spent on it, I'd do it in an instant.  I don't mind if people play the game, thats fine, but I don't understand why I have to be the person to make it available after spending the money when anyone else could have done it.  Not selfish, just not foolish either.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3334">mrmark0673</a> — Mon May 07, 2007 4:20 pm</p><hr />
