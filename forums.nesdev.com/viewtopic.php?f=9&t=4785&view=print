		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This has probably been gone over many times, and I've found some inconclusive threads on it. But, I figured I'd bring it up again and see what's currently available.
<br />
<br />As we all know, the cartridge connector in the NES sucks. The thing is really sensitive to dirt and dust, the pins tend to fatigue, and it seems like the plating on the original connectors wears off. There are a lot of hacks I've seen, such as flipping the connector around, soldering a Game Genie connector in, and all that - and then the alternatives of a toploader or one of those *gag* clones. But that's not what I'm asking about here.
<br />
<br />What I am curious to know is : of the currently available replacement connectors for the NES, are any of them of superior quality? I recently bought some on eBay and fitted them into a couple machines. They worked perfectly, and continue to work, but they seem to wear out quickly. One in my 'daily use' NES has only lasted a month. I now frequently have to wiggle cartridges to get it to play - I tend to get green screens and garbled graphics though, not the blinking of a lockout chip problem. And yes, I do thoroughly clean cartridges before playing them the first time, and I don't use the Game Genie.
<br />
<br />I've yet to see gold-plated versions, you'd think that this would be available. And the replacements don't seem to be made any better - just tighter.
<br />
<br />And, further investigating the problem, what is the best way to clean cartridge edge fingers? I've been taking the carts apart, and carefully cleaning the fingers with isopropyl alcohol on a q-tip. This gets them clean, but on many carts, the fingers appear worn or scratched, and some of the black marks just won't come off - perhaps this is dirt embedded in the scratches? Using an abrasive to clean them would probably clean it off, but it would also leave the plating that much thinner. The gold plating is the only thing keeping those fingers from corroding.
<br />
<br />And to further complicate things, some cartridge circuit boards seem to be thicker than others! I've got one copy of Super Mario Bros/Duck Hunt that always works - and looking at it in comparison to, say, Contra, the circuit board looks to be thicker - and it also feels tighter when inserting. I don't have a micrometer to measure it, but I would say with certainty that it is thicker.
<br />
<br />Anyone have any ideas? Anyone have a good source of better NES connectors? Do there exist gold plated replacements?
<br />

<br />
<br />I also have a SMB/Tetris/Nintendo World cup which always works, the boards that have epoxy blobs in them are probably slightly thickier than all ther other for some reason. Aside of that I guess none of my games "always works", in fact most never works before the 10th try even tough I've modified the connector so that the pins grip the game more.

<br />
<br />By the way, do you mean the cartridge contacts are scratched? Because yes that is pretty normal. I'm pretty sure alot of my catridges have those line type scratches/indents on them.

<br />The Nintendo DS manual actually recommends leaving a DS game in SLOT-1 and a GBA game in SLOT-2.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From my experience, dirt has very little to do with it. It's the complete looseness of the connector, and I'm pretty sure it gets worse over time. If I look at my GB games and my SNES games, they would work any time I put my game in the system. They seem to be as dirty as my NES games. Though dirt doesn't help, so it's good to keep them clean anyways.
<br />
<br />I did purchase a pin connector off of eBay. I don't remember which kind it was, but I'm pretty sure it was sold a lot for about $10. When I bought it, it worked great. Then after playing like 6 games, it started to loosen up. It still worked better than my original connector, but I figure the original connector was designed with more durability.
<br />
<br />I'm sure some are better than others, perhaps more expensive ones. I know it's not what you're asking, but it's why I highly recommend the flip-upside-down trick. The tight end seems to be an appropriate tightness for NES game boards, while the loose end seems to be an appropriate tightness for the thick NES motherboard.

The only NES I've tried it doesn't work at all now so I don't really know, but you have to saw down the connector and keep your NES taken apart constantly which is not good as not only this is ugly but it will get a lot of dust in it.
<br />
<br />As Celius said, the problems you can have running games on a NES probably have little to do with dirt, dust or whathever. Most of my games are prefectly clean (you can see the pics in bootgod's database if you don't trust me), yet refuse to run until the 16th try whathever I try. Altough I remember purchasing at least 2 times an used game that were really dirty, and after plugging them in the system graphic glitches appeared on *all* games (probably a CHR-Dx line was always disconnected from the cartridge), and I had to clean the connector inside the NES very seriously to fix that. I think it's annoying people sell dirty games, just like when you buy a used CD that is very scratched.
<br />
<br />I have sometimes seen GB games that doesn't boot, and you see glitches on the "Nintendo" logo when it boots, then it freeues. This happen quite rarely tough. I don't remember having any problem with other Nintendo systems.
<br />
<br />I never let my home console system turned off with a game system, but I never les my handled systems without a game in them. Probably because home in the console systems the connector is inside the case and will not get dust, but for handleds the connecor is direcly available so it is important that it does not get any dust.

Then your NES motherboard has to have all of it's pins (edge fingers?) in decent shape. Then you have to make sure you saw or file all the way down where you stick the game in. Otherwise some games will not make good enough contact. If you place a game in without it's case, it will make perfect contact and pretty much be guaranteed to work.
<br />
<br />And yes, you have to leave your NES mostly taken apart, but I leave the plastic cover on mine, I just got rid of the dust shields and pushy thing (which I hear people don't like, because it's nostalgic, I think). If one looks at my NES from the outside, there's nothing odd looking about it. That's because the plastic cover is still on, just without the screws, which protects from dust a lot better than leaving it off.
<br />
<br />Oh, and when I bought my second NES, someone had sold it to FuncoLand or something with a bunch of COTTON shoved inside the connector! I had to pull it out, and it was so loose from that point on...
<br />
<br />I leave games inside of my NES. Especially when they're RPGs that I'm going through. This is so I can turn the system on without risking some huge glitch happening where my saves get erased. When I leave them in their exact position they were at when they were working, it's likely they will still work when I turn the system on again.

<br />Wow, this is clever ! I never trough about that. But if you're playing a long RPG and wants suddently to play Mario or Mega Man you're quite forced to remove it or to play the games emulated.
<br />
<br />And yes, if there is always a game insterted in the connector it's quite possible that its spring effects wear off over time. In fact I wonder how different games and the conosle looked when they were brand new, something I've never seen.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well I've modded my connector so I don't have to take games apart to play them. I meant to say if you do nothing but flip the connector over with no modification, you can take your games apart and play them 100% perfectly, if you want to see that the modification -should- work.
<br />
<br />And if stuff collects dust, just wipe it off. Though honestly my stuff doesn't collect lots of dust because even though it's apart, I put a cover over it.
<br />
<br />And you're right, if you want to play another game, you'll have to take the game that's in there out. And I suppose the springs lose their quality after awhile if you leave it like that, but I guess I don't have to worry about this with my mod. I just say leave the game in there in case you want to play it again.
<br />
<br />It's true that my modification is slightly inconvenient, though. For this reason I've been wanting to perhaps make another connector that relies on tension instead of the stupid spring thing. But I think this might be pretty hard to do, and easy to screw up.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Regarding leaving games in the system - I generally try to never leave games in the NES when I'm not using it. The NES connector relies solely on spring tension, so leaving the cart in the connector can't be good for it in the long run. Other machines, I don't worry about. The industry standard board mount card edge connectors are a very robust, proven design. You don't worry about the cards in your PC damaging the slots - because it just isn't an issue. I've got plenty of old computers, for example, the Apple II, where the disk controller has been in the same slot for 20 years. That slot still works just perfectly, as do all the others.
<br />
<br />For portable machines, I can definitely see it being a good idea to leave a cart plugged in. Especially since the Gameboy uses single sided contacts. The cart will keep dust and pocket lint out of the connector.
<br />
<br />The NES is just much more sensitive to wear and dirt - and it needs to be properly maintained. I'm amazed at just how filthy some used carts I get are. I take them apart and scrub them clean, and it's frightning just how much black crud you can clean off the contacts.
<br />
<br />But, I'm still looking for a gold-plated or higher quality replacement conncctor for the original NES. I have heard mention of them, but I've never seen them for sale. Has anyone bought replacement connectors lately? How have they worked for you?

<br />The first page doesn't talk about it much, but the second page has the info about flipping it upside down. Lots of people for some reason couldn't get this to work, but really, if you do it right it works perfectly. And in doing the mod all you're doing is sawing/filing down plastic, so nothing should be at risk for getting ruined.
