To get an account, you have to sign up (and make it past a captcha (this keeps most robots/automated software out)), then it has to be manually approved (editing capability for that account enabled) by a moderator (e.g. tepples, memblers, myself (maybe not any more?), etc.).

(Is it still possible?)</div><br />Mainspace editing requires creating an account, which requires solving a CAPTCHA very similar to that on the forum, and then getting it confirmed. Talk page editing is open to IPs, but adding external links to a talk page as an IP requires (again) solving a CAPTCHA. So all we get are those few spammers willing to add an advertisement without an external link to a talk page, and those edits have proven easy for anybody with rollback privileges to blow away.<br /><br />There are currently three ways to get a wiki account confirmed:<br /><ul><li>Contact an administrator through PM or IRC.</li><li>The account is at least four days old and has at least two talk page edits.</li><li>Verify ability to receive email at the address associated with the account. </li></ul><br />In addition, many patterns used by spammers and other wiki vandals can be detected through regular expressions. Wikimedia offers a MediaWiki extension called the <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AbuseFilter" class="postlink">ABUSE filter</a>, which lets administrators define patterns to classify <strong>A</strong>ctions <strong>B</strong>y <strong>U</strong>sers, <strong>S</strong>uch as <strong>E</strong>dits. These patterns include regular expression matches, the experience of a user (days or edits), and more. If an action is classified as unconstructive, a filter can warn the user, prevent the action, or perform any of several other actions. Most filters enabled at NESdev Wiki are set to &quot;warn&quot; because most spambots don't know how to click through the warning. <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Special:AbuseLog" class="postlink">Here's what the ABUSE filter is keeping out</a>.

Even during the era when automatic confirmation based on e-mail or two talk edits wasn't possible, both <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com" class="postlink">NESdev Wiki</a> and <a href="https://pineight.com/mw/" class="postlink">my own wiki</a> got dozens of automatically generated FirstnameLastname sign-ups clogging the Recent Changes page because bots or sweatshops were passing ReCAPTCHA. Once I realized that was the problem, I instituted the ABUSE filter and the present Q&amp;A system on my wiki. And what worked there has largely worked for NESdev Wiki as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">which is exactly why for decades I have advocated that manual human intervention be part of the approval process for account sign-ups (on anything).</div><br />As with all things security, it's a tradeoff between security and convenience. It depends on the site, but sometimes reverts every week or two are more convenient for administrators than having someone standing by in all time zones 7 days a week to approve applications for new accounts. And the accounts that go on to make trouble here are more the StalkerDragon types than those who sign up and post off-topic advertisements.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...those edits have proven easy for anybody with rollback privileges to blow away.</div><br />How many users actually have &quot;rollback privileges&quot;</div><br /><a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Special:ListUsers/sysop" class="postlink">Administrators</a> and <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Special:ListUsers/rollback" class="postlink">rollbackers</a>. But <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Special:ListUsers/rollback" class="postlink">rollback</a> is a shortcut for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Reverting#Undo" class="postlink">undo feature</a> that anyone can do, just without the confirmation page or the ability to change the edit summary for the revert.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">and how are they acquired?</div><br />An administrator adds a user to the rollbackers group through the user rights interface. You can request the privilege by asking an administrator (such as myself) while mentioning your history of reverting vandalism on the wiki, such as through use of the undo feature.

It's not listed in Special Pages. It's not listed on the recent changes list. Shouldn't it be linked somewhere users might find it? I had to type in the URL manually to get there.<br /><br />I'd asked about it before, but I had the impression that it was extra stuff that appeared on the recent changes timeline for someone with sufficiently advanced privelages (but I guess I had the wrong idea here?). Is RecentChangesCleanup supposed to integrated at all with the Special:RecentChanges? Like, shouldn't the &quot;hide&quot; button appear there too? Why is it on this other hidden page?
