<br />I take it FPGA is still the most logical route towards achieving this vision?

<br />I'm not much of a hardware guy, but from reading your ideas it does look like something backward compatible could be made... But that somebody could very well know more about hardware than I do, so I'm not gonna say anything for sure!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1KB of SRAM is nothing by today's standards of hardware.  Even on current programmable logic.  Adding memory hardly justifies a new mapper IMO but it's your mapper so really you could call it MMC-747 if you wanted.
<br />
<br />Now I'm not as up on the MMC5 as I'd like to be at the moment.  You've got bankswitching, counter, multiplier, sound gen, and 1/2KB ram.  I don't have a feel for how much the sound would require, but nothing screams HUGE to me.  A modest FPGA should suffice I would think.  Bunnyboy says there's enough logic on the powerpak with his Xilinx Spartan 2.  Not sure what he's using specifically but I'm guessing less than 1000 logic blocks.
<br />
<br />I really don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised if it actually fit on my 644Mcell Mach X02 CPLD in the NESDEV1 devcart project.  If not I'd bet it would fit on one of the larger CPLDs in the family.

The MMC5 has 100 pins, so your device needs alot. Plus if you have a FPGA you have to load it usually. It's not like a fixed circuit that works instantly when power is applied. 
<br />
<br />Really if it were that simple to slap a MMC5 on a FPGA, CPLD or whatever, it would have been done already. Maybe someday someone will clone the MMC5, but it really is the most complicated mapper that exists barring maybe that weird pirate mapper 90. Even still though MMC5 probably beats mapper 90 for its features and such.

<br />
<br />A 100 I/O logic is a non-issue, and while it's big it's still not huge.  And configuring the FPGA isn't a show stopper either, especially if you used a CPLD.
<br />
<br />Who's really tried to replicate the MMC5?  I think it hasn't been done because there isn't much motivation to do it.  Or at least not by people who have the tools and know how.  That and most homebrewers who may get excited about it's abilities have a long way to go to utilize all the capabilities of the MMC3 let alone the MMC5.
<br />
<br />If the NES has been put on modest programmable logic I'm pretty sure it's within reason to do the same for the MMC5.  There's just no one so far that's cared enough to do it that can.

<br />You forgot the most complex part (IMO): it keeps track of what the PPU is doing by watching the memory fetches, so that it can provide attribute data (attributes can be applied to individual tiles, rather than 16x16-pixel areas) and pattern data (512 tiles can be used for sprites and thousands can be used for the background instead of the usual 512 we have for everything) at the correct times.

<br />
<br />I've been holding on to this since I don't really like releasing incomplete stuff, but since you're working on a MMC5 game and I haven't worked on it in quite a while, here's a link to my <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/mmc5.zip" class="postlink">MMC5 powerpak implementation</a> in its current state.
<br />
<br />Oh, and FWIW.. your proposed changes are minor enough that the powerpak should be able to do it without much trouble (maybe no audio though).
