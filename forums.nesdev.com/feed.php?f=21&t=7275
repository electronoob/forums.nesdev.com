Photoshop assumes you're working on photos. Edges in photos are soft due to imperfect focus, interpolation in the camera to compensate for Bayer-dithered image sensors, and the nonzero size of pixels in the image sensor. The JPEG lossy compression used on photos introduces additional artifacts along edges, where colors are close but not exact to the intended color. Fuzzy fill algorithms fill the color under the action point and additional colors close to it, possibly proportionally mixing in pixels whose color is far enough from the original color. It sounds like Photoshop is using at least such a fuzzy fill. GIMP can use one or not depending on the Tool Options.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Dec 28, 2010 8:13 am</p><hr />

I've done something similar in previous projects, though with an added step. IMHO when you convert something from a high color palette to something limited like NES's it's best to hand convert it. GIMP/Photoshop is just not intuitive enough to convert this, it needs some human touch. For example:<br /><br />Let's say I want to convert this image to something the NES can use:<br /><img src="http://www.yibbleware.com/nes/files/pixelme-original.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />If I convert it to NES's palette it looks pretty ugly (to me) and there's too many colors for the NES to handle:<br /><img src="http://www.yibbleware.com/nes/files/pixelme-auto-nes-pal.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I've narrowed my palette down to 4 colors, and I try to convert it again, but still not even close to what I want:<br /><img src="http://www.yibbleware.com/nes/files/pixelme-auto-limited-pal.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Then, in this final image I hand drew the pixels over the original art (image) and I'm happy with the result. (Though on a real NES on a CRT the dithering would probably look bad <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )<br /><img src="http://www.yibbleware.com/nes/files/pixelme-final.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />EDIT: If you want I can take a piece of your art and hand convert it in a [private if you wish] video as an example.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4574">cartlemmy</a> — Thu Dec 16, 2010 7:32 am</p><hr />

Using Photoshop for pixel art doesn't make much sense, since its strong point is image filtering and processing, things you absolutely don't need in this case. But since that's the only thing your artist is going to use, it's your job to adapt everything. I wouldn't worry about programming my own conversion code though, that seems like a huge waste of time.<br /><br />I think the first step would be to give the artist a palette, so that only those colors are used. Like you said, there will probably be slight color variations due to the way Photoshop filters images when scaling them and such, but as long as you have the original palette, you can quickly convert the image to indexed mode and select the clean palette, so that Photoshop itself will remap the similar colors to the one they should all be.<br /><br />Other than that, I can't think of any other kind of automatic processing you could do. Ideally your artist is aware of the system limitations and will draw accordingly, but if that's not the case you will have to adapt everything yourself, which turns your artist's actual title to "conceptual artist", seeing as you will have to use their work as a base for the final product.<br /><br />I faced some of that back when I asked my wife (girlfriend back then) to draw me some sprites. I explained the basic limitations, but there was no way she would grasp all of it, so I always had to move some things around, slightly reduce the color count, things like that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Dec 15, 2010 3:58 pm</p><hr />
