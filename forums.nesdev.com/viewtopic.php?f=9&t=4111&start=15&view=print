I got one that was shipped to Brazil with no problems, it should be the same with Argentina. These are not exactly like the original connectors though, you even have to leave a few screws out for it to fit. You no longer need to push the cart down (don't even know if it'd be possible), just inserting the cart works 95% of the time, if the cart is in good condition.</div>
<br />
<br />Yes try typing "72 pin Nes" on Ebay...
<br />
<br />I got a new gold one from "videogameswholesale" for 10 eur (18-20$ approx shiping to europe included).

<br />I just heat the screws with the soldering iron while slightly forcing the cart open. If you do it carefully, the case doesn't get damaged. I never close them back, but I heard it is possible as long as you use larger screws than the originals.

I've tried with two pirate famicom ones and with this original Super Mario Bross 3 with no luck. It was a lot easier with UNROM. Sadly, at Retrozone, they only sell MMC1 boards. If they had MMC3 boards I'll buy one for sure. I don't know what to do, the guy who sold me SMB3 has very high prices. Maybe the next month I'll buy another copy of SMB3 just to replace the one I destroyed T_T.

<br />
<br />If not, maybe some tracks on cart been cut when you remove mask ROM's. :/
<br />
<br />EDIT:.... Maybe i know whats wrong:
<br />
<br />Did you write directly 128 or 256KB files into 512KB FLASH??? If yes, try join smallest BIN file into one 512KB. Some eprom/wlash programmers need that!!  (like old WILLEM) <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Example: You have 128KB PRG bin file. Use hexeditor, mark all 128KB data and copy it, then paste it four times (in END of file) to make one 512KB file. NOW write it to 29F040. (256KB files join twice)
<br />
<br />If you have Windows/Total Commander: Copy your PRG or CHR 128KB file, rename it as (example) DATA.001 and make another copies as DATA.002, DATA.003 and DATA.004. Doubleclick at DATA.001 and TCommander automatically make one 512KB file named DATA.OUT - rename it as PRGROM.BIN and NOW write to 29F040. 
<br />
<br />256KB files simillar - make two "DATA.001 and DATA.002 files and dclick .001 file to make 512KB "DATA.OUT".

<br />Sorry to revive this old post <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />.
<br />Well, I bought another SMB3 NES cart. This time I used a desoldering station to desolder the roms, so there's not any broken path. Also I bend up the pins as recomended in the guides. This time I'm using a AM29F040 to the PRG and a AM29F010 to the CHR. I'm flashing to them SMB3.
<br />The only problem is that the graphics are all scrambled. I have sound and If I press start I can go to the first world map with sound in it too. But I can't progress any further, because the game freezes if I try to enter a level.
<br />If I have sound, then the PRG is not the problem right?. I tried 2 different eproms for both the PRG and the CHR, and tried also with the PRG 0 and the PRG 1 versions of the rom. What can be wrong?. I checked the pcb several times with my multimeter. Everything seems to be ok. Now I have a real usb programmer, and it checked and verify the flash eproms correctly everytime.
<br />I'll really appreciatte any advice, because this time I managed to get sound and scrambled graphics, but thats better than a green screen of death right?. I'm closer to finish the project now, just need a little help to figure out what can be causing this graphic issue.
<br />Thanks in advance.
<br />Whipon.

<br />
<br />It that's not the problem you should double check how you rewired the CHRROM. Also sometimes flash ROMs have different pinout than EPROMs, and the doccumentation widely available is for EPROMs. But I guess this only apply for 28-pin chips (below 64kb) so you should be good with your 32-pin chips. Make sure that the /WE pin of flash ROM is tied to VCC.

<br />Yes, I know the guides are based on UVEPROMS, but I use the datasheets of my flash eproms to locate the correct pins. Also aso I'm soldering the WE pin to +5V.
<br />I cleaned bot sides of the cartdridge connector with isoprophilic alcohol with the same results. I'll desolder the CHR socket and I'll try again. I'll let you know If I manage to do it. My last try a few months ago failed because I was soldering the sockets in the back side only, and then, the traces in the front side where not connected to the sockets. Now I'm keeping a space of 1 mm between the socket and the pcb. Then I make sure that the tin is in both sides of the pcb so the traces in both sides are connected.
<br />Wish me luck <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />.

<br />Well that's weird normally the solder leaks into both sides of PCB (assuming you place enough of it).
<br />You probably just got a wire wrong by one pin or something like that. It's really easy to do a small mistake like that (I've done it in almost every devcart I ever made) and you can fix them without much troble (often adding a new wire because you cut a track you shouldn't have to or something like that).
