You can't replace terms like registers, mirroring, addressing, etc. by simpler ones because they describe unique things and behaviors that don't necessarily have counterparts that are easier to comprehend. We can EXPLAIN all the terms and behaviors individually so that when you see them at a later time they won't sound like alien concepts, but programming knowledge is something you build progressively, you have to understand one layer before moving on to the next, you can't skip to the topmost layer and expect things to be worded in a way that circumvents everything established in the layers below.</div><br /><br />As sadly as I have to agree on the term, there is a form of ambitions in certain people that made them attempt to do those kinds. For many people on &quot;forgot&quot; or just gave up, they didn't find motivations or ambitions, since &quot;it's a waste of time to make tutorial for a dead old program&quot; beliefs or other things. <br />For me, I have big one, that every time I felt quitting, I only went to sleep to calm myself down, because I feel upset so much for a while since no tutor or any road is there for me. I waited time to try again, and try to explain much differently. The road I always get stuck is 6502 Processor Overview in Week 3. <br /><br />As I'm predicting you hear this term also, I'm not like any people who have said those kinds. I find much more values in NES programming than before more and more, especially NIKI homebrew games, Mario Adventure 3: Mushroom Mayhem, yet I often struggles with coding without forms of learning styles like mnemonics. It's odd that I understand partially in BASIC, Java[Script], and C#, yet I struggle the most in 6502, even though I feel it's one of hard-to-learn coding languages and it's obvious.<br /><br />There's a learning styles called VARK where it shows some kind of learning styles for people who learns best of: Visual, Aural, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic. For me, it's possible for, at most, all 4 of it.<br /><br />Maybe I can't explain well or get you guys to understand where I come from because despite my native tongue is Spanish, I use English majority of my life, and I can't use grammar terms correctly many times. But I can tell ya, I'm a fast learner when I understand something, I really strive for good qualities on something. <br /><br />As I know tutor is highly discourages or not possible much here because &quot;they have lives&quot; or &quot;they do it for money for teaching&quot;, I want to let ya know I'm serious on tutoring, and I'm willing to record and understand details by details to make NES tutorials so good, even children can learn more than what they could do in NESMaker.<br />It just a good communications between student and tutors for support is really needed to help me understand as &quot;God-Tier&quot; as Shiru, NIKI, and DahrkDaiz, who got me into this homebrew business in the first place. <br /><br />If you feel I'm not even trying. despite the fact that to other eyes, I may be another person who doesn't care or gives up easily: <br /><br />-I understood completely with basics of Binary, HEX, and decimals/ natural numbers. <br />-I understood that the address $ is like a room where you place the codes, and certain &quot;rooms&quot; inside does specific jobs, like the sprite-color decision &quot;room.&quot;<br />-I at least know what Mapper does in certain types, from increasing tile size, to the abilities of making beautiful music using N106. <br />-INC means increment, which is mathematical technique in increasing number by 1, unless stated.  <br />-I understood that graphic limit is set to 13 colors, with one transparent for each &quot;4&quot; colors, which is 3 colors and 1 transparent, and the screen is 256 X 240, but issues in vertical lines is 256 X 224<br />and other things about 8X8, 16X16 Sprite limit, where vertical mirror is possible, but not horizontal mirror. <br />- $ and # symbol is different, where $ is the address, and # is the number-number. <br />-I somewhat partially understood that A, X, Y is a type of register that &quot;allows you to store numbers [Address? Digits/HEX?] temporary&quot; like forms of transport from one address to another, OR some kind of math abilities that allows you to carry the number using &quot;LDA&quot; and &quot;STA&quot; stuff. <br />-I partially understood about high-power and low-power byte like what they said on Nerdy Night Week 4: <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">The palettes start at PPU address $3F00 and $3F10. To set this address, PPU address port $2006 is used. This port must be written twice, once for the high byte then for the low byte:<br /><br />&nbsp; LDA $2002&nbsp; &nbsp; ; read PPU status to reset the high/low latch to high<br />&nbsp; LDA #$3F<br />&nbsp; STA $2006&nbsp; &nbsp; ; write the high byte of $3F10 address<br />&nbsp; LDA #$10<br />&nbsp; STA $2006&nbsp; &nbsp; ; write the low byte of $3F10 address</div><br /><br /><br />If I understand the code from BASIC languages with certain opcodes on what it does, like DEC and INC, the same way with the C# programming beginners where they did the &quot;Application &gt; NameSpace &gt; Assembly &gt; Codes&quot;, then I have compatibility to understand 6502 languages, but I tend to struggle with certain information that doesn't comprehend to me because it isn't explain well for me, or because, dare I say it, &quot;It's boring to try and read it and remember it.&quot;<br /><br />I just want to put this down just to tell ya what kind of person I am. You could think I'm &quot;autistic moron&quot; or anything like that, or anything that people who has elitist personality could put me down, but I just want to let ya know I'm really trying hard to figure out on codes yet struggle on obstacles, and I'm serious and determined to learn, that I'm willing to be perfect attendances for tutors. Discord, other ways, I'm in.<br /><br />Even though I know it's high chance that response is very obvious that no tutors is here, or potentially discourages to try to tutor. If there isn't any forms of tutor that can help me learn in very well styles that I could rival Shiru and/or DahrkDaiz in terms of creative codes, I might as well ask so many ridiculous questions on something that's potentially easy here like I did. <br /><br />It's getting late here atm. So I hope I don't make any errors to explain.<br /><br />EDIT: I don't ever want anyone, young or old, to go through struggles what I gone through that gives up easily.</div>

The only shortcuts I can think of is using mnemonics or &quot;cheat sheets&quot; that tells you what the code does and copy-paste the specific code to make things faster. <br /><br />Also, if I tried to re-reading in the same place, it will feel like I ain't progressing and demotivation increases as I get stuck. I'm not like average person who could easily understand it; it could take them 2 weeks at most to understand, this could take me about 8 months at most. Maybe I'm wrong or right, but the fact I'm stuck in Week 3 for many times, rarely going to Week 4 or 5, but revert back to week 3, just made me upset.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">We're here to help, we can explain things in a different way, we just don't have the time to rewrite every document and tutorial so they're perfect for everyone, and we don't have time to private tutor each person that comes to the forum saying that the information that currently exists is not in line with their favorite way of studying.<br /><br />Coding games is not an easy task, you'll have to adapt and overcome several hardships, so consider this the first of many problems to overcome. You'll have to adapt and make do with the documentation that exists, because no one will rewrite it all overnight. We'll be here to help when things don't make sense.</div><br /><br />I'm a little unsure about this. It's either I feel I refused to accept this paragraph, or I'm trying too hard to accept and understand, that the fact I tried to learn on something I'm stuck on for long time. I could say, &quot;Maybe I want to be the one who'll rewrite it all overnight if I get real tutor and help.&quot;, but it'll just be repeating myself and encourages frown against me.<br /><br />If that's true about help, where did the &quot;elitist&quot; and &quot;strict&quot; ideologies come from...?<br /><br />So what if I write to write a storyboard / script of how to learn NES 6502 programming, and I need some form of clarifications?</div>
