		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Basically the title. I had somebody make me a program to separate a file into two files byte by byte for the purpose of working with the Irem M92. I'm curious about looking into Gunforce II with IDA Pro, which is why I need to interleave files, because I was looking into the game's cut 4 player mode. What's interesting is that there's actually blank space in ram the size of that used by player 1 and 2. In addition, writing to what would be the x and y values of each character copies the value into memory near it as to store last frame's x and y position, just like what is done with player 1 and 2. It appears they got pretty far into implementing a 3rd and 4th player before dropping them.<br /><br />I'd like to be trying to see if I can get sprites to work on the system, but I still haven't found a good deal on eBay so I won't be able to test it in on real hardware. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> Major Title 2 going for over $300 is simply insane.<br /><br />Unrelated, but I have gotten a lot of my old SNES code to work with an object table being offset by direct page, so there's that. I also got a github for something unrelated, but it might encourage me to work a little harder on the SNES so I can post something presentable. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

	</div><br />Edit: I fixed it; All I had to do was uncheck &quot;load as code segment&quot; upon opening the file to make it stop grouping everything, which let it start at 0xE734 and disassemble correctly. There's only a handful of routines it found; I'm guessing it couldn't find any of the object routines because they aren't exactly trivial to find, in that you don't access them in an &quot;if/else&quot; way.

Graphics and data preparation for SNES programs.  It's extremely useful to be able to use (say) Matlab to convert graphics, compile HDMA tables, optimize tricks like HDMA palette expansion and lossy packed-pixel Mode 7 that take a substantial amount of compute time on a Pentium 4...  Even for audio, every now and then I encounter something my collection of audio processing tools doesn't do, and it's Matlab to the rescue.  If you don't want to pay for Matlab, NumPy (an offshoot of Python) may offer similar capabilities.  Octave is basically free Matlab, but it's not quite the same and I've had trouble with colour depth support...<br /><br />The task you started the thread over would be utterly trivial in Matlab or a similar language, and they tend to be far more user-friendly and OS-independent than C and its relatives.<br /><br />...<br /><br />On the other hand, I've been familiar with high-level programming for nearly two decades now, and with Matlab specifically for most of that time, so it's easy to just whip up a routine.  If what you want to do can be done well enough with existing tools, the entry barrier might be too high to be worth it.  (I haven't gotten far enough in SNES programming to have a good idea of what can be accomplished without custom tools.  The M92 situation is probably worse, but without a baseline, that doesn't mean much.)

You should use an assembler, <strong>binclude</strong> the original program file, and use <strong>org</strong> to set your location to patch over. That is exactly what the project I linked you to does. The readme is detailed in describing the intent, and the patch file is commented.

It's just that for some reason, with some games I've opened up, IDA is innable to find more than four routines for whatever reason. There are some routines that I have no idea how it could find them; for example, ones where the CPU jumps to a memory address defined by somewhere in ram, like what I'm doing in my object routine for my SNES game engine.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikejmoffitt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">for the IO port address space.</div><br />Thanks! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> However, I did now realize that I could have just set a watchpoint for values in ram that I know are being used by the different players... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

(The registers are 0x06 and 0x07 of the IO address space)<br /><br />Something that's bizarre, is that for whatever reason, the game reads the value for each controller register, and then copies it to five non-continuous areas in ram, which makes debugging a lot more annoying. The two guns that you carry count as separate objects, and the relationship between them and the body is also really bizarre, which is also unfortunate. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />I did find how to freeze the time though, so I don't have to worry about it running out. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
