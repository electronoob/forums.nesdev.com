		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What does it mean when a ROM has [a1] in the name?<br />The GoodNES documentation says it means &quot;alternate&quot;. But that doesn't say much. What is &quot;alternate&quot; supposed to mean?<br />Is this an actual alternate version of the game that exists as a real cartridge?<br />Or is it just a hack? (In this case, why isn't it called a hack? You don't see a random hack listed as &quot;Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG0) [a164]&quot;, so when do they decide to name a hack [a1]?)<br /><br />For example, there is &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3 (U) (PRG1) [a1]&quot;. But Bootgod lists only two different hash values for the American version of the game: One for PRG0 and one for PRG1. So, what would &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3 (U) (PRG1) [a1]&quot; be? (Unfortunately, I wasn't able to check the contents of this ROM for myself. Whenever I find a ROM that's labeled like this, the GoodNES 3.14 renames it to something different.)<br /><br />I understand bad dump and overdump or hack or tranlation. But the &quot;alternate&quot; label is really a mystery to me. Can somebody please clear up what they intended when they decided to label certain ROM version with [a1], [a2] etc.?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As I understand GoodCodes, the [a1] notation refers to an alternate dump. Alternate dumps are <em>supposed</em> to represent multiple official revisions of a single game that didn't have public names. They're analogous to (PRG 0) and (PRG 1), which are common official names for revisions of NES games. The difference is often bug fixing, such as a crash in <em>Castlevania</em> or the &quot;Miss twice and your out&quot; in <em>SMB3</em>. But sometimes it's not clear at first whether an alternate dump is a revision or a bad dump. Hacks are supposed to be [h#].

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But the problem here is that GoodNES uses <em>both</em> names, (PRG) <em>and</em> [a]. So, it's not just two independent naming schemes from two different people. Both names are used in the same list. So, when do they use [a] and when (PRG)?

(No-intro does have a library of known-good dumps, but AFAIK they carefully have not yet touched headers)<br /><br />It wouldn't be too hard to write a simple program to convert nestopia's NstDatabase.xml back into iNES (or occasionally NES2.0) headers, though.<br /><br /><br />The only explicable example of [a1] I can think of in GoodNES is the two dumps of <em>Lum no Wedding Bell</em>â€”one's the (correct) mapper 87 dump, and the other is mapper 101. The two mappers are mostly compatible, differing only in CHR ordering.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know how common it was, but long ago when I was compiling the NES Music Authors list by relative text searching, I remember at least a couple times where I accidentally found text that, at the time, I believe had been hacked into unused areas of memory.  I can't remember what it said, but IIRC, one of those tags was in Metal Gear.  I wonder if some of it is stuff like that, non-obvious hacks.<br /><br />Another NES ROM sorting tool that I used to use, was called NEStoy.
