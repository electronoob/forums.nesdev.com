<br />
<br />I'm looking to get some PCBs fabbed and was wondering if anyone were interested in helping me out.
<br />
<br />I'm looking to pretty much make a copy of a pre-existing PCB, but have no experience or knowledge in how to draw up a proper schematic that I could send for production.  If I were to provide the original PCB I wanted to essentially copy, would anyone be willing to draw up a schematic that I could send to a manufacturer?
<br />
<br />If anyone is interested, feel free to shoot me a PM.  I'd be very interested in paying for your help!

<br />Not saying I will do this, but whoever you hire make sure they do the board layout as well.  A schematic alone is not enough to get a board made.

<br />
<br />It's basically a 4MB Genesis board with battery backed SRAM.  I could mail out the exact board I'm looking to basically reproduce to anyone interested in helping out.
<br />
<br />As far as schematic vs board layout, I apologize for my ignorance but I don't fully even understand the terminology.  Basically, I want something that I can send to a PCB manufacture and say "build this" and be all set.
<br />
<br />I'm very motivated with cash in hand, if someone wants to make $100+ for pretty much copying a preexisting layout, hit me up <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I'm looking to make PCB's that I can use for Sega repro projects, but much more importantly for Sega Homebrew projects. Matt and I just produced Hangman SG which was coded from scratch by Adam Welch, and we're working with him on future (and substantially larger) projects. I know that a 4 MB board with battery backed SRAM will be perfect for literally ANY project that can be thrown at it, so I think that's the most logical to produce. I also hope that I can provide these for sale to members of the homebrew and repro communities to limit the number of "donors" used for projects. Because of this, I'm likely going to order 1,000+ boards.
<br />
<br />I'm not interested in purchasing actual boards from a member, just looking for a board schematic and board layout that I can personally send off to a manufacturer so that I can produce as many as I'd like. I'd certainly pay a decent price for that service, but I'm not looking to order a run of boards through a member.

<br />Try ExpressPCB. I usually use ExpressSCH for schematics, but I haven't tried ExpressPCB yet
