<br />
<br />an xml or some file would be nice for emulators to use for loading games.  i am at the poing in mine where i am adding mapper support, but not sure how to go about that.  i am thinking of using a text file as a database to check for known games.

<br />
<br />I must be the only person in the world who thinks storing binary data in plain text form is like the dumbest idea ever.  Since when has XML been considered an easy file format to work with?  Give me a plain old binary .dat file any day of the week.  No chance to screw up... much simpler, much, much more efficient, and a whole lot easier to work with.
<br />
<br />But I see lots of people doing stuff like this all the time now.  Even a friend of mine online (bbitmaster) is doing something like this for data for his game he's working on.  I guess I must be in the minority.   Or perhaps there are benfits I'm unaware of.
<br />
<br />&lt;/totally offtopic and unhelpful&gt;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />doesnt have to be plain text.  i didnt think it would be that large.  doesnt matter.  any file.  i just want the data so i can use it my emu for opening games.
<br />
<br />but what ever the file is, binary or plain text, it should be agree'ed on every one.
<br />
<br />and i think it should be installed like a lib.  that way one file to keep up to date and multiple emu's can use it.
<br />
<br />back to the topic....  does goodnes have this data file ?

<br />And a lot harder to make semi-self-documenting. I'd choose pipe-separated or comma-separated or tab-separated for publicly distributable files containing much text.

If the GoodNES convention is what you're after, at least a few people have managed to RE GoodXXXX because there are unofficial Japanese versions of GoodXXXX, so it's possible.

<br />I just downloaded the latest GoodNES and it doesn't have the same files as the one I downloaded a while back. I guess the author changed the format to be internal and compressed in the program

<br />
<br />*edit* looks like most of blargg's tests have been included too, useless in this format though: scattered, renamed, no documentation, eg. what would an ignorant person make of <em>IRQ Handler Test by Shay Green (30 Jun 2005) (PD)</em>? ... I'm interested, what's your (blargg) opinion on their inclusion? Knowing that every ROMs site in the future will have them for download, washing away the intended purpose you've created them for in the first place.

<br />Numerous "bad dumps" also come from Vimm, who figured it was a good idea to append his name and url to the end of every rom on his site, thus giving the rom a different signature in GoodNES.

<br />
<br />You can do what you like with the info, that's what it's there for <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> If you'd like, I could generate a text file for you to use, just let me know which data fields you need. It surely beats trying to grab the info manually from the site.
