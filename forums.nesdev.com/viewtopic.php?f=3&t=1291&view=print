		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The most accurate NES emulators execute one opcode at a time and also update the PPU/APU/MMC states at each clock cycle. Nintendulator falls into this category. (What, if any, other emulators do so?) I can't determine what Nintendulator's full speed is on my system, since I can't find any option to turn off throttling. From what I've heard, though, it runs into speed problems with any system much below 1 GHz. Nintendulator appears to be written in a mixture of C and inline assembly. I don't know how much, if any, speed optimization has been done.
<br />
<br />If an accurate NES emulator were written in pure, optimized assembly, how fast do you think it would run? Would it be possible to obtain 60fps on a 400 MHz or so Celeron, or is there just too much computational work to be done? I've been trying to get a NES emulator off the ground (I currently have a working cycle accurate CPU core in C), but I'm still a bit undecided about which language to use. Many emulators are written in C++, which makes the coding easier in some aspects; how much of a speed hit does this incur? Would assembly mean a major speedup, or would it be fairly subtle? What area of Nintendulator is the biggest bottleneck?

You might also want to turn off auto-frameskip (and set frameskip to zero) if you want to measure its speed.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Josh wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I don't know how much, if any, speed optimization has been done.

<br />
<br />Reasonable optimization in the CPU core, and some very small bits in the PPU.
<br />Overall, the PPU is probably the biggest bottlenecks, with the APU close in second place.

<br />
<br />Actually, I'm <em>not</em> using the callback - I'm repeatedly polling the buffer via IDirectSoundBuffer_GetCurrentPosition (with a sleep thrown in the loop for good measure).

<br />
<br />i think c is fast enough for teh nes, thats what i am coding mine in.  to get faster you might want to use inline asm.  i will do that on my emulator, but last with the c souce still as an option to maintain platform indepence.
<br />
<br />if you are working on an emulator then you need to learn how to profile and analysis your code.  that is what i am doing now. (no asm)
<br />
<br />x86
<br />cpu ~ 100 Mhz
<br />ppu ~ 400 Mhz
<br />sdl drawing ~ 200 Mhz
<br />
<br />and less on ppc, but i think the x86 has cache problems where the ppc has a larger cache.
<br />
<br />and all i have working now is cpu and partial ppu.

<br />100Mhz does seem rather a lot for your CPU core. Why is it so slow?

<br />
<br />ppu was slow till i did one simple change... i was accessing the pallet with the same function as the ppu memory reads, switched to direct reading and gained 25 % cpu  on p3 800.    wow !   got that idea from valgrind with cache misses and the fact that its a function call and gets called over 60 000 times a ppu frame.
