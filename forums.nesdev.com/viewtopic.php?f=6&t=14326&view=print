		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been able to compile my own VegaPlay ROM but there are things about the program which I felt were needed just to make it more interesting than just a collection of NSF files.<br /><br />I wanted to have the screen be more visually appealing. I've made a custom background and it looks nice but it's still static and I was wanting to make them <span style="color: #FF00BF">flash</span> <span style="color: #00FFFF">different</span> <span style="color: #80FF80">colours</span> just to make it more lively. I also wasn't a fan of how the track instantly changes as soon as you scroll up or down. I'd rather have it like in FamiCompo or have the currently playing track play while you move the cursor and only stop to change when you press A or something. So a way to <span style="color: #BF0080">pause/play</span> and <span style="color: #FF4000">select new song</span>.<br /><br />I tried looking at LogoNES to see how flickering colours could work. I've also looked at the files and how they work for the past 2 evenings and I'm really just breaking the program more than anything.<br /><br />I know that when it says something like &quot;BEQ EndDrawChk&quot; it sends the message to &quot;EndDrawChk&quot; and begins its cycle. However I don't know what the difference between those CEQ, GRA, PEL phrases mean and what they do alongside the $4000 or $45 $c10.<br /><br />If any of you guys are like pros at this kind of stuff It'd be awesome if you could tell me how to code this out or explain how some areas work so I could do it myself.<br /><br />Thanks.

For example, if you silence the channels by writing $00 to all envelope registers ($4000, $4004, $4008, and $400C) and leaving $4015 alone, and then you scribble $FF over the RAM locations where an engine stores &quot;previous period high byte&quot; values that it uses for avoiding phase resets, it may restart the note.<br /><br /><em>(suppresses urge to make a &quot;polish&quot; pun)</em>

I think I'll resort to a Stop/Play function somehow and the colour flicker thing.<br />Is the code for stopping/playing simple though?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Stopping is the same as pausing, really. Write $00 to $4015 to silence, and stop executing PLAY every frame.<br /><br />Restarting means to run the NSF INIT function again before you resume executing PLAY once per frame. (You also need to zero out the RAM areas it uses before calling INIT, and initialize some other things, information <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NSF#Initializing_a_tune" class="postlink">here</a>. VegaPlay should already have a function that does all this before it calls the NSF's INIT though, so just re-use that.)<br /><br /><br />I don't think it &quot;ruins&quot; the track to use the pause/resume method I suggested, though. In the vast majority of cases it sounds quite natural. I called it imperfect simply because it's not entirely foolproof.<br /><br />In the music compilation ROMs I've made, it was sufficient for almost all tracks I've encountered. For the one or two oddball tracks that didn't unpause cleanly I just added some special code for that track. Depends on the engine, though, and I don't believe <em>any</em> of the problem tracks were using contemporary versions of Famitracker, which is what you're using, right?
