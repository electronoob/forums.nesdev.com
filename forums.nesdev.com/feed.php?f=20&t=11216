Some games won't dump BG tiles (DMG games as well) with the latest custom-gfx-hd revisions either.

My unofficial build is the last update of the custom-gfx-hd branch complied for people that don't know how to compile. It works fine for me on most regular GB games. GBC games don't work at all for BGs, and sprites for GBC won't load without using the manifest file.<br /><br />I remember now some games won't load the BG files for whatever reason no matter what. Not sure why. I will compile all the builds and see what works and what doesn't. The 32-bit BMP problem was a huge hassle so that's why I compiled and used the later revisions myself.<br /><br />edit: Here is revision <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5aZT1MLfWJsRUYtcExoMV92WnM/view?usp=sharing" class="postlink">ed6790ee337d</a>. I did a quick test and it dumps and loads BG tiles. This is the version before the newer GBC dumping code was added.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6613">GGuy</a> — Fri May 08, 2015 8:07 am</p><hr />

The integration process is mainly about porting over the GB/GBC code and tightening things up. The only areas that require non-trivial reworking are the custom graphics and LCD emulation. Everything else just gets cosmetic work and clean-up. That shouldn't take long. GUI programming (Qt specifically) may take a bit more time, since I have no prior experience with it. I don't expect custom graphics for the GBA to make it into the first point release, but definitely for the GBC.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Fri May 08, 2015 7:38 am</p><hr />

That's an issue with the format Windows saves their BMPs. You need to save the images as 32-bit ARGB BMPs in 1.0. Older versions of GIMP (2.6 and older as far as I know) did this just fine, but newer ones muck things up. You'll probably have to use an image editor other than MS Paint. Later revisions of GB Enhanced removed 32-bit images because the alpha channel was completely useless, and image editors couldn't agree on how to handle BMPs. Later revisions also added PNG support (loading, not saving).<br /><br />If you find all of this frustrating, honestly I would encourage you to just wait until GBE+ (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/shonumi/gbe-plus">https://github.com/shonumi/gbe-plus</a><!-- m -->) comes out. It does away with a lot of things that are complicated about the process of replacing graphics. I really don't know how people like BigHead (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://bhemuhelp.co.nf/other/smlc.html">http://bhemuhelp.co.nf/other/smlc.html</a><!-- m -->) manage to work with GBE 1.0 as it is, especially since it's command-line only. The process will be much smoother when there's a GUI and all images are expected to 24-bit (seriously, the alpha channel is a pain in the rear, both for the end user and GBE). GBE+ is currently in the phase of integrating GB/GBC support; after that comes a GUI, then reimplementing custom graphics.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Fri May 08, 2015 6:51 am</p><hr />

What manifest? If you're using the build GGuy made, I can't help you since I haven't used it. If you're talking about the manifest used from the custom-gfx-hd branch, don't use that. It's experimental work intended to handle GBC sprites.<br /><br />I downloaded the 1.0 tarball from GB Enahnced's Google Code page, compiled that, and was able to dump and load tiles from SaGa. If you're doing anything that's not based on the 1.0 version from the Google Code page, that's likely the cause of the problem.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Fri May 08, 2015 6:02 am</p><hr />

I tested it with 1.0. I can dump BG tiles from SaGa just fine (English version).<br /><br />Anyway, without hashes, you run into several issues. One of them is that not all of the data comes directly from ROM. A game may compress data (bit-packed fonts for example) and decompress them to RAM, meaning addresses could be arbitrary, and even result in collisions where multiple graphics come from the same few RAM addresses. <br /><br />Another issue is that the same tile could theoretically exist twice or more in ROM (e.g. copies of a common tile across several memory banks), meaning the emulator would see them as two separate tiles if it does no comparison on the data itself. This would require users to edit the same dump twice (or more) even though visually the tiles are the same.<br /><br />Lastly, there's tile data that doesn't come from ROM or RAM as direct data, but instead gets generated programatically by the game code (software rendering). If it builds the data one byte at time, it will writing to VRAM from CPU registers. If it builds the whole tile at once, the address will be in RAM, a volatile address.<br /><br />The point of my approach was to do things in a manner that covered as many bases as possible and would be applicable not only to the GB/GBC but other 2D tile-based systems as well. The problems listed above are only exaggerated on something like the GBA where graphics are commonly decompressed into RAM for example. If you look at VRAM itself, you know exactly what the game is trying to draw. Hash that data sufficiently, and there's no ambiguity or collisions.<br /><br />I've been meaning to write up the technical theory behind tile replacement via hashing for a while, so that others can implement themselves. I suppose I'll have to finish up the document soon.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Fri May 08, 2015 4:38 am</p><hr />

I was using 1.0.<br /><br />I was thinking that you'd run into a problem with the hashes. If you fixed that, then I guess there's no issue.

There's no point in not waiting for the transfer to finish and looking at VRAM for the graphics. GBE only hashes data at the end of a frame (before VBLANK) so the data will be in VRAM by the time the emulator wants to do anything with it. Reading data from random ROM addresses seems less intuitive than looking at VRAM itself.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Thu May 07, 2015 7:20 pm</p><hr />

@Sik - Not without knowing the 16-bit salt used to create the final hashes. It's just two bytes (MMIO registers OBJ palettes). You might get lucky if the base hash before salting is 0 (the salt is just XORed onto the hash) or if a game picks two OBJ palettes and sticks to it, then you can derive the base hash easily. But even then there would be no (imo acceptable) way to make a standalone tool for completely automatic conversion.<br /><br />Otherwise, the emulator could generate both the new and old hash, and if an image file containing the old hash is present copy that file but under the name of the new hash. That works, but feels convoluted to me. The easiest thing to do is accept the limitations of 1.0 graphics packs and just add an option in later versions of GBE+ to hash like the old GBE. It'd literally just be an extra if..else... statement or two, so it isn't a big issue.<br /><br />@Dragon - Kirby's Dreamland is totally doable. In fact, you're not the 1st (plot twist, it was me: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kbd7lGXfRxI">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kbd7lGXfRxI</a><!-- m -->) Sorry about the mobile link; blame my phone. As I mentioned, solid colors are inadvisable to edit. To GBE, all instances of that tile are the same whether it's the &quot;sky&quot; or the pause menu background or whatever. There is a way or two around this, but it will be part of GBE+ (GBE's successor, with organized code, a GUI, and GBA support). So for Kirby, I would not touch the sky, but editing the tree's leaves is probably fine. Any tiles that are that same shade and solid (the mountains in the BG in Level 2 for example) will be whatever color you made the tree's leaves in Level 1.<br /><br />Some good games that you could also try: Megaman I - V,  Super Mario Land (Bighead did this), Bomberman GB, Kirby's Dreamland 2 or Block Ball.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6368">Shonumi</a> — Sat Dec 20, 2014 8:52 pm</p><hr />

Eh, incompatibility ain't an issue as long as you back up all of the art you've drawn so far. Really, that's where a bulk of the work goes.<br /><br />By the way, I decided for the demo I'd like to reskin Kirby's Dream Land. It's a very short game and there characters are tiny so replacing their graphics would be super-simple. But before I draw an entire sheet, can I get a confirmation that something like this would work in your emulator?<br /><br /><img src="http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/354/3/a/kirby_sprites_by_dragondeplatino-d8ak7hn.png" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6734">DragonDePlatino</a> — Sat Dec 20, 2014 5:17 pm</p><hr />
