<br />Yes 0.25 fixed the compatibility problems, this must be some other bug. The FTP link in the first post is to the CC65 snapshot folder which always has the latest nightly build, so it's fine. Does it show any additional info with the exception?
<br />
<br />If you want to share the .dbg file and the .nes ROM that produce that exception you can send them to e-mail address thefox (at) aspekt.fi

<br />
<br />One suspicion I had was that I had unused segments defined in the object file. I corrected that but it made no difference.
<br />
<br />You may download a zip file with the .nes, .nes.dbg and .o files <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qbradq/badnes.zip" class="postlink">here</a>. The linker config outputs a single object file per your instructions.
<br />
<br />The source tree is not needed for this to occur.
<br />
<br />Steps to reproduce:
<br />1. Extract ZIP file contents to a directory.
<br />2. Load the .nes file with your patched Nintendulator binary (dated 02/26/2011)
<br />3. Open the debugger window
<br />4. Click the "Run" button
<br />5. Click the "Step" button
<br />6. Badness ensues

<br />I can't reproduce this for some reason, it doesn't crash here. Did you try it without the source files?
<br />
<br />EDIT: BTW, the stack trace + any additional info would be helpful even if it only displays hex addresses

<br />Yes I was able to reproduce it, it was a stupid bug. The code which stripped the ROM path was assuming there was at least one / or \ in the path. Download <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/nintendulator-bugfix.zip">http://thefox.aspekt.fi/nintendulator-bugfix.zip</a><!-- m --> and extract to v0.25 folder to get the (hopefully) fixed version (this zip doesn't contain the mapper files).

<br />I know, right? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Btw one "bug" with this version is that the way it behaves with macro line infos is kind of random. Since CC65 now supports multiple line infos for one macro address (line info for the macro invocation line, the actual macro body line and additional line infos for nested macros), it'll always pick the first one that the dbginfo API returns. This is sometimes the invocation line, sometimes one in the macro body, and sometimes might be something else. I didn't bother fixing this yet since I don't know what would be the best way to handle it.
<br />
<br />EDIT: there's something seriously wrong with clicking on the source code listing to set a breakpoint in the latest release, I guess the new SVN updates broke it... EDIT2: fixed <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'll release the fix later with a new version.

<br />I don't think this is a bug. The bug was that it DIDN'T change the mode in previous versions of Nintendulator. So what you're experiencing is the proper behaviour. Also this fix was made by Q, not by me.

<br />I don't see why that feature would bother you... IF it always switches PPU mode to the next mode when loading, then you're using an older version which had a bug. This is not the proper behaviour I was talking about.
