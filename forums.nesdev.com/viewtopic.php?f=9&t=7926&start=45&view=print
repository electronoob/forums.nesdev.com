<br />
<br />
<br />UV LEDs will not erase an EPROM.  You need relatively short wavelength UV, around 250nm, before an EPROM will erase.  A "Germicidal" bulb is what you need.  Though as others have said, cheap erasers are available on ebay and stuff that will work.  The sun does not work very well, and is not reliable enough to erase an EPROM.   If an EPROM is not erased fully, it may check blank but will error out during programming.

<br />
<br />First you need to setup your counter to reset when it counts to three (11 in binary). For that you use an AND port from a 74LS08 with the output connected to the clear pin of the counter...  I like 74LS393 more than 74LS161 for the counting purpose, but it's because I have a LOT of 74LS393 chips here...
<br />
<br />Now for making the 256KB bank work you need to detect that the counter is at "10" and add a new chip (I recommend 74LS157 as it selects two to one) that reconnects MC and MP17 lines to the mapper chip. You can simply connect the input selector pin from the 74LS157 to the high bit of the counter.
<br />
<br />A input from the 74LS157 goes to GND, B input of 74LS157 goes to mapper chip pins for PRG and CHR.
<br />
<br />Hope that ideas the I posted here help with your goal. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />And this was my first post. Hope we get along  as I plan to post a lot here !

<br />
<br />I am not so much expert but I think I should use a NAND gate because for enabling reset mode I need a Low voltage. For producing a low I should connect 1 and 1 to a NAND gate.
<br />Is there any way to control Reset without using any extra gates?

<br />
<br />(read the whole article if you can as it's a great read ! but the page I linked to has an discrete parts circuit you can use...)
<br />

<br />
<br />The diode logic trick actually helped me to save some board space on a project I built for MSX computer with an YMF278B chip (Moonsound) several years ago...
<br />
<br />
<br />Also for the 74LS157 you only need to use two ports of it:
<br />
<br />A-------|157\___Y_  Y will be GND if Sel pin is 0 and will be A17 if SEL is 1
<br />B-------|___/
<br />Sel------/
<br />
<br />connect GND to A
<br />Connect A17 from AX chip to B
<br />Connect Sel to high bit from counter.
<br />Strobe goes to GND. 
<br />
<br />Repeat for CHR bank (use other port, chip has four)

<br /><img src="http://www.upload-jpg.com/images.php/f87622357/01.PNG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />But there is still a problem. For enabling Reset of 161 a low voltage is needed but Y3 is producing 0 , 0 , 0 and then 1 so it will not work at all in this way and it will be in a loop on first step but if I just replace 161 with something else like 74LS393 which its Reset needs High to activated I think there will be no problem, right? But It seems 74LS393 is more complicated than 161 and there are two pairs of Q and even Clock in it! What the hell are they? Is there any better and simpler TTL than 74LS393, something like 74HC74?!
<br />I think it is better to use two separate ports for MC17 and MP17, it is more safe, don't you think?
<br />My conclusion for A1 and A4 (of 157) : it is possible to use either GND or A17 (coming from 161), but I prefer to use A17 itself because I think using A17 in PCB designing is more convenient than GND lines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Actually 74LS393 is simpler because it just counts pulses you put on the clock pin. 
<br />
<br />It's a binary counter and each time you clock it, it adds +1.
<br />
<br />74LS161 is a sort of register file with carry in and out ... 
<br />
<br />So 161 is more complex than the 393.  In fact 393 is made of several 74s in "daisy chain"... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  And it has TWO 4 bit counters so you only use half of the chip for this...
<br />
<br />Now, you can temporarily remove the 161 from the circuit and test if setting:
<br />
<br />H L
<br />I  O
<br />---
<br />00 = first game      (256KB)
<br />01 = second game (256KB)
<br />10 = third game     (512KB)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems I can't replace 161 with 393 at all. There is a problem with Clock. Enabling 161 count mode require a Low to High signal but for 393 it must be a High to Low signal. So I need an IC which has a Low to High Clock and Active High Reset. Is there any chip like this?
<br /> I am really confused about M2 signal, M2 is always on high state, by pushing reset button it goes to low, by releasing, it goes to high and stays at that state. My conclusion is : It should work with both Low to High and High to Low Clock signal, but in practice it is not working, why?
<br />Still I can't analyze the function of 102 Capacitor and 148 Diode. Can someone analyze their function?

<br />
<br />The PHY2 signal keeps the capacitor charged through the diode (it's pulsing) and when you hold reset the pulses stop. That makes the capacitor discharge through the 161 clock pin, making it detect one pulse (due to state change).
<br />
<br />74LS393 works for me with the same diode+capacitor circuit...  I don't see how it would not work for you.
