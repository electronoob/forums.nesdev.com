If the game is good enough, people are gonna flip their monitors. They did it for Dodonpachi in 1997, and they did it for Ikaruga, and any other shooter port since. :3 Try releasing a vertical shoot'em up today, and you'll hear people whining if it <strong>doesn't</strong> have tate. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Even if it's originally created for consoles.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Two very nitpicky suggestions:<br /><br />1. Writing the palette displays colour immediately on the screen even when rendering is off. During transitions you appear to have one frame of &quot;rainbow&quot; lines in the middle of the screen because of this. (Avoidable by only writing to the palette during vblank.)<br /><br />2. It seems like the flickering has exactly 2 orderings (looks like you're drawing the sprites in reverse every second frame? except for the oilcan?). The appearance might be improved by having more orderings than that so it isn't in locked 30hz patterns where the same pixels are always dropping. It's good for sources like YouTube that often display at 30fps, but can also help with visual coherence if there's more rotation to break up the effect.

That's a stupid mistake, thanks for pointing it out. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> A lot of screen updates are blended into the &quot;original&quot; code as it is, so when I eventually &quot;cleaned up&quot; screen transitions it was kind of a hack job.<br /><br />2. Yeah, I noticed that immediately after watching a guy streaming it on Twitch yesterday, and people watching thought the sprite flickering was much worse than it actually is. Kinda annoying that you have think about those kinds of things...<br />The sprite handling already causes quite a performance overhead, since I'm keeping the game's original sprite buffer and converting them all to 16x8 (8x16) NES counterparts. The oilcan isn't the only thing that's fixed either - Donkey Kong has to be drawn in a specific order, the barrel he's holding must always be in front of him, and a few sprites are used for masking, etc.<br />So it's already a relatively demanding routine, and I should probably be able to fit in a third kind of ordering into it without making it much heavier on the game.

I never was a fan of the messed up level order in American Donkey Kong machines though, kind of wished there was an original version as well.<br /><br />Audio sounds fine, didn't hear it in the video but it's there, nice.<br /><br />Start button only used for starting the game, no pausing! Real arcade game heh.<br /><br />Saving high scores could be considered an upgrade from the arcade version, but on the other hand arcade machines weren't supposed to be turned off so I guess it can also be seen as a way to replicate the arcade experience in a NES. If you haven't already, you might want to include a way to delete the save data so that people don't have to take out the battery.<br /><br /><br />A few other suggestions:<br /><br />Only one player?<br /><br />It seems like you are ignoring the Famicom expansion port bits (bit 1 of $4016 and $4017) so I can't play this game with my arcade controllers (I only tested this in Mesen so far though, and Famicom multitaps doesn't work). I suggest to read $4016.1 and $4017.1 as well and merge them with player 1 and 2 button data respectively, so that external controllers works as player 1 and 2 as well (NES Donkey Kong is doing this).<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Where did you get that name for the fireball enemies in <a href="http://mario.wikia.com/wiki/100m" class="postlink">100m</a>? As far as I can tell from <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Fire" class="postlink">MarioWiki</a>, only Atari came up with that name. The different-looking fires in 25m seem to be called Trouble Bugs.</div>Trouble Bug? That's a funny translation of the original Japanese name ojamamushi (ojama = hinderance, mushi = bug), but I like it. I think ojamamushi is a word used for people that gets in the way all the time, in English you might say &quot;third wheel&quot; I guess. It has nothing to do with bugs though, it's just common pattern in Japanese for sayings like this. For example crybaby is nakimushi (naki = crying). In the Swedish NES Donkey Kong manual (most likely translated from the English one) I think they where simply called fireballs.<br />It always annoyed me that the ghost enemy in the final level doesn't have a name, or at least they are never referred to separately from what I remember. But if their behaviour is really identical to the trouble bugs I guess they are the same guys just in a different shape.

Commercial games that use DPCM seems to do this as well. The way I do it is just read $4016.0 and $4017.0 until two reads match and then I read $4016.1 and $4017.1 until two reads match but save them into separate variables, I then merge the variables using ORA so that controller III works like controller I and controller IV is same as controller II . There are more effective ways of doing it (check the wiki), but it works on real Famicoms and some commercial games does it this way too. Also I can confirm that Tepples' Concentration Room controller routine works with my Famicom.<br />(<strong>Edit:</strong> Ninja'd by Tepples)
