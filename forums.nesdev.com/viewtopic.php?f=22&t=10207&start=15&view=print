I figure for the money it'll program almost anything nes related and I can spend that time on the game

I think there's some advantage to doing it this way ... something about having more control ... but he's the one who knows more than me about the dev cart side of things.

The 28C parts are as easy to write to as RAM, and the 29/39/49C parts are only marginally more complex. (But do stay away from UVEPROMs; the amount of time you have to spend erasing an IC when you want to reuse it will dramatically slow down your development speed unless you have a large pile to rotate through.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is worth contacting Nintendo. Over ten years ago, as a wee tyke, I sent them a childish email saying I want to make games for them. I actually got a very well-written response on the basic structure of a game development team and (politely) why I would not be making Game Boy Color games for Nintendo at the time. If they'll respond to *that* I wouldn't put this topic out of the question.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's with a little disappointment that I have to announce that this project has been put on hiatus.  Mike and I agreed to cease working on it together for the time being, due to differences in priorities and ability to contribute (basically I became the only one making progress while he was tied up with full-time work.  i am a freelancer.)<br /><br />But!  All is not in vain.  I decided to show off the small concrete progress we made up to this point.  Since I expect what I create from here on to be more in my own direction.  I figure no sense in keeping the old stuff to myself now.  In the span of the past few weeks I created these graphics and got them displaying on the NES.  I also got the player's character running around with the crosspad.

The sprites look kinda like first-gen NES sprites (no outlines, shadows or volume) but better (larger and more detailed). I'm quite impressed by the graphics, and hope that someday you can put them to good use.
