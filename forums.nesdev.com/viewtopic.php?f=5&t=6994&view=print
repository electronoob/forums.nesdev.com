<br />Its friday, after lunch, and I'm totally unable to focus on work stuff. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I'm about to see if the Linux kernel will implode due to whacky use of "bind mounts" to remap NFS shares piecemeal fashion to create suitable chroot jails for sftp user accounts.
<br />
<br />I can't wait to get home and finish FF-II (on loan from my most awesome mother in law).

<br />That's not me in the photo!!!!

<br />I have no use for those carts.  Just saw the entry in my RSS reader and realized that to most people that huge collection or carts woudl be junk, but to nesdevers they are a source of cases and potential donor boards.
<br />
<br />I had no idea that some NES games we "glob tops".  Cheap bastards.
<br />
<br />Its like getting 1.44MB AOL disks in the mail... They were reusable.  I downloaded all of Slackware to about 60 of them in 1995.  Then the CDs started arriving.  Only use for those was building a Dyson Sphere.

If they are all there, it's a DIP board.  There are label variations too.  The less common ones don't have the seal of quality, but it's not too useful for identifying the board.

<br />And the label doesn't have the white line in the middle of the lable, it has the Nintendo logo in the middle and no S.O.Q. on it. It's the standard NES-MH-USA. Out of the six or so SMB/DH carts I have/had, this is the only one I have found without a COB....so it's a little trickier to find IMO.

<br />Woah, that's interesting.  I don't remember seeing any like that, after going through about 150 SMB/DH carts.  But there really are a lot of these carts out there, and variations obviously.  Out of all those I guess there were maybe 25 - 30 that had DIP chips.  That's what was used for Garage Cart #1 (but I modded the board to use 16kB CHR-RAM).

<br />So you're saying that your bathtub would have even more carts the the one in the OP if you were to bathe in them? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />
<br />
<br />Just for the record, the 2 or 3 SMB+DH carts I checked were all glob tops. I don't remember the details though (connector, label, etc).

<br />
<br />The only difference I can see that you'll be able to see from the outside of the cart is the "fingers" coming off the ends of the connectors on the solder side of the PCB. On the globs, they're much shorter than the ones on the non-globbed versions.
<br />
<br />There is also I green line of masking on the very bottom of the non-globbed connectors.
<br />
<br />That's what THESE are like... YMMV.
