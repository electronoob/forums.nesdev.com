		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have in hand an original no-revision 2A03 CPU, from a PlayChoice 10 board. Once I am home I will be socketing the CPU and PPU on my NES, as well as getting an Everdrive N8. So, are there any interesting tests that I should run on this thing? There are mentions here and there of differences, the most notable being the APU ignoring the repeating noise bit, but apart from that I don't see much proper documentation of what changed in later revisions.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />We don't really know what's changed. The only things I'm certain of are the lack of tonal noise and that pin 30 doesn't enable testing, but instead is either part of a crystal oscillator or somehow disables the clock.<br /><br />It's conceivable that the un-read-ability of $2004 on the famicom is actually an artifact of the CPU instead of the PPU. And maybe the duty cycle of M2 differs between the 2A03 and 2A03G.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On an arcade repair forum, I've seen at least a couple people say that with the game VS TKO Boxing (AKA Ring King), that it works with original 2A03, but not with 2A03H (whether anyone has tried other revisions, I don't know).  Something seems to be different.  Either that, or it's more fake chips going around.  I bought an H revision too from probably the same arcade parts supplier, but I think I had sent it in with the other CPUs to be decapped.<br /><br />Could be related to whatever protection TKO Boxing uses (it's on a daughter-board, like all VS games with a mapper).<br /><br />edit: BTW, I have an RP2A03E that came with my Playchoice, I could run any tests on it likewise, if it helps.  Seems to be the same as the G revision as far as I can tell.  My Playchoice is kinda broken down at the moment (power supply going out, maybe), but I've got the CPU in my front-loader.
