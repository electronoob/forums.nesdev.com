		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ok, maybe this is a stupid question, but i'm a bit confused about the DMA and the OAM, so i'm asking this just to be sure.
<br />
<br />the values written to $2004 are written into the SPR-RAM, wich is a 256 bytes memory space internal to PPU. ok, thats easy, but this where i get confused:
<br />
<br />extracted from qeed's doc (also the same lines are written in the wiki):
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">* On even cycles, data is read from (primary) OAM<br />* On odd cycles, data is written to secondary OAM</div>
<br />
<br />is that "primary OAM" the SPR-RAM? and if it is, what's that "secondary OAM" that the doc refers to? is it a fast register inside the PPU? in that case, if both primary and secondary OAM are internal to the PPU, why the PPU needs two DMA registers? i mean, if both registers have the same purpose, why are there two of them and not just one?
<br />
<br />thanks in advance for any reply

You can't access them directly.</div><br />ok, thanks Blargg, so i guess i didn't missunderstood the doc. probably the two-DMAs-thing is just a hardware issue, one for writing (for programmer's purpose) and the other for reading (for PPU's purpose).[/quote]

<br />Between scanlines you have to check which sprites are in range (i.e. have parts that should appear in the next scanline) and only those that do are copied to secondary OAM. It's not gonna be always the same 8 because the sprites are only 8 or 16 lines tall, so different sprites will be in range as the screen renders.
