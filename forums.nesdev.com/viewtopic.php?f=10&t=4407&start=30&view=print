		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Chris Covell made a disassembler that just took the IRQ/NMI/RESET vectors and recursively followed the code to differentiate code/data. Similar to how IDA works. It was originally written in Java, and only supported 16kB ROMs. I ported it to C++ and extended it to support larger ROMs, and then wrote a new version in D soon afterwards.
<br />The output of the recursive disassembly is relatively good (but not as good as a manual audit of everything like you can do in IDA).

<br />
<br />I have been searching all over the Internet for a group of smart individuals who could port MM9 to the NES and this looks like the right site. I found this old thread and it got me really excited until I read through the whole thing and it looks like no one is actually working on it.
<br />
<br />Believe me, if I had NES programming knowledge (which I don't), I would be all over this project. Is there anyone here who would be willing to work on this? Or if it's already being worked on, can someone direct me to the right thread/site? Thanks.

<br />
<br />Maybe Mega Man 9 is already in iNES format like other downloadable NES based Wii games ? In that case the job was already done by Capcom and there is no need to do it again. But I doubt that, as I've heard it's not truely a NES game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not in iNES format unfortunately. It will be a big task to port it to NES, that's why I am looking for hardcore Mega Man fans who are up to the task.
<br />
<br />What I just realized though is that you NES coders don't really know much about the Wii, as the Wii hackers don't know much about the NES. That's a problem. What I'm gonna do is go to some Wii hacking forums and see if I can get someone to prepare the Mega Man 9 files in such a way that you guys can work with them. (Unless someone here knows about Wii hacking, please speak up.)
<br />
<br />Now, a question. Presumably we would just take an old Mega Man game like Mega Man 2 or something and then just modify it with all the Mega Man 9 levels, right? Or would we want to start from scratch? I just figured that with MM2 and MM9 gameplay being virtually identical, it would be simpler to just use a lot of the coding that's already been done.

<br />Yeah, while it's possible to disassemble Mega Man 2, the result don't come with any clue of what it's doing, so it will be almost harder to figure that out than making everything from scratch.
<br />I'm a Mega Man fan, it's just I won't invest in a Wii for a single game. The day they make a GBA or DS version of it I'm buying (despite the lower resolution).

<br />1. Since you don't have a Wii, does that mean you are not interested in porting it? Do you really need a Wii to be able to port it?
<br />2. What files will you need to do it?

<br />But I'm not alone on this board, there is a lot of other people arround (maybe they're not there at the momment, but wait for their comments).
