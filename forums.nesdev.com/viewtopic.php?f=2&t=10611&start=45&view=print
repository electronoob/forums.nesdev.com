At the conceptual level you have four screens arranged in a square, with $2000-$23FF being top-left, $2400-$27FF top-right, $2800-2BFF bottom-left, and $2C00-$2FFF bottom-right. What scrolling does is place a viewport the size of the screen within this square. What mirroring finally does is to determine how the addresses that fall within that viewport map to nametable locations. Without extra nametable memory in the cart you always need some kind of non-linear mirroring, as there are twice as many address locations as there is nametable memory (CIRAM).<br /><br />Just in case the above was a confusing way to put it, the mapping (mirroring mode) assigns a nametable location to each address within the four-screen square. The viewport in turn selects some portion of the square, and the way the addresses within that portion are mapped determines what gets drawn.<br /><br />Even though it's pitched towards emulator authors, I think you really need to read through the <strong>The skinny on NES scrolling</strong> page to understand how all the addressing stuff works out when the PPU draws the background.<br /><br />Edit: Square/rectangle/whatever... should be clear enough. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Some of my early init code cleared this $2400-$2BFF range. (Nowadays I have it clear $3C0 bytes to one value and $40 bytes to another in a subroutine.) But the goal of the diagram was to connect mirroring to the arrangement terminology that the &quot;H Scroll&quot; stuff implies. Besides, what you say isn't true of diagonal mirroring.
