<br />
<br />There is a workram tab and you can select a few MMC1/MMC3 boards and upload your .sav file and click write.  
<br />
<br />If your board isn't listed though you'd have to write a script to support that board.

<br />Otherwise I'm willing to share the PCB files (think I did in a previous post) so you could order the PCBs yourself as well.

<br />
<br />If you plug the device in and run inf wizard at one point you should see the device listed.  Just select it and finish creating the inf file.  Then from the device manager when installing device you can navigate to your newly created inf file.

I had some problems with MMC3 awhile back and revised the dumping script and seemed to correct the issues I had.  I think I shared it in a different thread, but I should probably post it here as well: <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18341918/mmc3_full.ad" class="postlink">mmc3_full.ad</a><br /><br />Not sure yet exactly how I'm going to manage the scripts and mappers with my own software/firmware.  The easiest way to do it is just build them into the firmware.  Then I could auto detect the mapper or allow the user to override the mapper via the host software.  The U.S. licensed library of games should be pretty easy to fully encompass.  It would be nice to have script support for my new firmware and software, but I'm kinda lazy and don't see the need to write a script parser and everything.  Plus I think I can optimize and speed up the process which can't be done well with dumping scripts.  The best alternative to a script I can offer is easy mapper templates that could be added into the includes when building the firmware.  Might even be better for some since it would be entirely in C and I'll include some mapper specific helper functions.  Then if one desired to write their own 'script' it'd actually just be a file included in the firmware build that one could fairly easily do themselves with the provided bootloader.<br /><br />I will point out one 'flaw/bug' that I've noticed with the cuurent kazzo firmware/software/driver as a disclaimer.  I've yet to hear anyone else report this issue and for awhile I assumed it was just my PC.  But I have a problem where communications will drop mid-dump at random times.  If I try enough I can usuallly get a dump to complete, but we're talking &lt;5% success rate depending on the ROM size.  I've seen this with two of my PC's now and every single Kazzo I've  assembled (a dozen or so).  All of those kazzo's work fine on my laptop.  It's possible that it's a windows7 vs windowsXP problem, but I've heard reports from a few people that it works fine on windows7.<br /><br />From what I can tell, it's a software/firmware issue (possilbly PC hardware), and not a kazzo hardware issue.  Although I'm curious if trying some different values of USB D- pull up resistors might affect the results.  I've seen similar bugs related to that resistor.  But in using my own software and firmware this whole problem is non-existent.  This is one of my main motives for writing my own software/firmware.  I cannot stand behind and easily provide support for the software/firmware that's released by the original author as I have a hard time understanding and even re-compiling the firmware/software.  There were several more techincal bugs I found related to flash carts that I was unable to resolve myself which basically forced me to write my own.<br /><br />TL;DR  Use the original software/firmware at your own risk.  I can't provide technical support for it.  However the software/firmware I write, I will provide technical support for.
