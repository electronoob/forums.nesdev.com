		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know BSNES is praised for its efforts in mimicking the SNES hardware as exact as possible - is there an NES equivalent?
<br />
<br />The recent popularity of BSNES in the media has made it somewhat difficult to google search as it returns a lot of SNES related links. 
<br />
<br />I thought this would probably be the best place to ask - sorry if it's the wrong area of the forum, I just registered to ask this question. Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nintendulator and Nestopia are usually considered among the most accurate. According to Bisqwit's <a href="http://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/NESAccuracyTests.html" class="postlink">NES accuracy tests</a>, which are based on running multiple test ROMs on various emulators, puNES is the most accurate, with NESICIDE and Bizhawk up there also. However test ROMs can't measure emulation accuracy in all areas. For example, I've noticed something wrong about the audio emulation in puNES. Nintendulator also doesn't emulate the non-linear mixing scheme for the APU.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've found FCEUX to be very accurate with what it will allow for the CPU side to be mostly correct, while Nestopia and Nintendulator both have bugs when compared to just what an NES will do. Nintendulator has bad [zp],y writes to MMC1 and probably other mappers, and Nestopia is actually more of a famicom emulator because you can get some bugs to appear that wouldn't happen on an NES, although the bugs are something that can be good because then your program will work on a famicom too.

<br />
<br />I haven't worked on it in several weeks [not sure where my energy/motivation/time is going these days--probably the lack of sleep and family demands] but the last thing I was working on was making my emulation match traces from Visual2A03.  I posted several threads about things that Visual2A03 reveals that I thought were assumed/unknown.  Alas most of that is too esoteric to be widely interesting, so I retreated to my git repository to enhance my emulator in hopes of putting out a new release.

<br />
<br />I dunno, but it fails. You can test it with the MMC1 Test ROM here:

<br />If you need the source I'll give it to you and comment out anything you want, although it's not long or hard to understand.
