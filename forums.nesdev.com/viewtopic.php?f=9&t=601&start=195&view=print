I do agree with you though, images that are supposed to show the presence/lack of noise should always use lossless compression.

One of the pictures also says to cut the trace coming off of PPU's pin 21.  So if I had to guess, it's that he reworked a good portion of the output circuitry.  The connector shown near the top is a single end connector that allows for 3 separate wires/connectors to go through it, I think (left audio, right audio, and video).<br /><br />The links near the top of the page also go over anti-noise/anti-banding modifications for different Famicom hardware revisions, if I'm reading that correctly.

On my 13&quot; Sanyo CRT at school, I cannot see them whatsoever, even if I get really close to the TV. They were quite visible on both TVs before the mod.

Without doing an A-B, though, it does look like the top-loader has slightly softer pixels, and the audio is a bit quieter, and possibly a slight bit more muffled.<br /><br />I am perfectly okay with this.<br /><br />It looks like I'm going to have to refurbish my toaster model if I want to enjoy Famicom expansion audio with an Everdrive, though.
