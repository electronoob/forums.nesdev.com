While assembeld (ca65) the output is the same for both routines except for the driver address and number of bytes to transfer. Everything here is correct.<br /><br />Right now there is no way I can get SOUND_DRIVER_A to work.<br /><br />If I go back to the version which only has the ability to load one sound driver and I only include one sound driver (no matter which sound driver I include) then it will always work. I'm not sure why including the code for a second driver, and including the data for a second sound driver would cause any weirdness.<br /><br />If I use SOUND_DRIVER_B data for both SOUND_DRIVER_B and SOUND_DRIVER_A than &quot;A&quot; works.<br /><br />It looks like when I use SOUND_DRIVER_A the last thing written to $f2 is $17 which is gain, and the last value written to $f3 is $9e (%10011110, custom gain and gain rate). This shows me it's not processing pattern data because it's not cycling through the channels. The only thing being updated are the spc timers. I know what code would produce this value and it's the exact same code in SOUND_DRIVER_B. Most of the code between the sound drivers is the same, everything that handles the it pattern data is the same, as is everything which handles volume and such.<br /><br />If I use the original snesmod code and only include 1 driver than it works no matter which driver I use. I do not understand why SOUND_DRIVER_A would &quot;magically&quot; (that word rather implies some sort of bug some where doesn't it?) work.<br /><br />The only changes to snesmod.asm was having two different spcBoot routines (which are the same except for the data they read and the number of bytes they transfer), and sm_spc where I'm including two sound drivers instead of one.<br /><br />Anyway I posted this because I thought if I wrote it out something might jump out at me and possibly somebody might have some ideas of things to check.

I can imagine having multiple sound drivers for SNESGSS since the soundbanks don't seem readily interchangeable.<br />- It sounds like there are some issues with your changes to SNESmod, but unless you provide those code changes it will be hard to determine what went wrong.

Sound driver A would work and sound driver B would not work. I still cannot arrive back at a situation where loading both drivers works correctly, or where Sound driver B works as it did back when I first posted about this. What I did was change the segments the sound drivers were located in. But they have always been in banks that requried far addressing and the boot code accounts for that.<br /><br />I've attached one of the sound drivers in question (the one which was working this morning but now no longer works, even though no driver code was changed)<br /><br />I also did another test using only the snesmod driver and snesmod w/ pitch modulation and ran into the same problem. Only the snesmod w/ pitch mod would work, not the original snesmod sound driver. And again, each of those sound drivers work fine on their own, and the code is structred in the same way.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, so whatever is the second driver you include doesn't work? This does seems like it might be related to upload issues, and possibly ROM layout as well? I'd try to dump the SPC memory just after the upload finishes, and check that it matches up byte for byte with what you are trying to upload. If there's a mismatch, we know that the upload process is the culprit.<br /><br />Edit: Another idea that popped into my head: If this issue happens after replacing a previously uploaded driver with a new one, I wonder if it has anything to do with stale data that's confusing the new driver?<br /><br />Very cool that you perform live!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I should have thought of this earlier, and I won't be able to verify until tomorrow, but when it seemed like a sound driver was failing it was likely because the song was from a soundbank compiled for the other sound driver. This would explain the flip flop effect because when I was messing around with it I'm sure I switched the driver in the makefile at some point. I overlooked that detail from when I first set up that system. Man that thing in my head that let's me think thoughts, whatever it is, I think it's starting to fail.

SNESMod uses higher numbers for the default and lower numbers to turn something on... I flipped that around for one group of commands, and when I noticed, I had the opportunity to go back and fix this in many songs but I decided it wasn't worth the effort. In the future I will give more thought to things like this, but for me it didn't matter because it wasn't for public release, and I fixed the issue for the public version.<br /><br />I'm glad you implemented the TF sharing, when I was making NES songs I always used mml which was rather tedious for that sort of thing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">HertzDevil's 0CC-FamiTracker has find and replace.

Every once in awhile it's possible to end up with a stray command somewhere and than it's so much fun to hunt down exactly where it is, as I usually use commands on every line of most columns.

In the Makefile I was using I didn't set the flags for one of the soundbanks to use the 2nd sound driver. In addition, on the SNES side, something in this particular project was writing to an area of RAM reserved for the sound driver.  This explains why either sound driver would work in any other project, but not in this one.<br /><br />edit: I updated the subject to make it clear that the issue has been resolved.
