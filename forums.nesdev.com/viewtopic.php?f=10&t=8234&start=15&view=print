When I replaced the elec caps I used the same mF , but had to use ones with a higher voltage tolerance since that was all I could find. After that it would actually last a lot longer before freezing.

<br />
<br /><strong>martinpal80</strong>, good to hear that. Voltage doesen't really matter, except three things - 1)not less than 16V 2)than higher voltage, than higher price 3)than higher voltage, than bigger size, so they might not fit. By the way, did you checked voltage on pin 1, when your console "on and running"?[/url]

<br />The NES might have been, but the Famicom is from '83, and if you consider the time needed to design the console, it's definitely early 80's technology.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oops, 80sFREAK already mentioned the date thing.

<br />You know I've been studying EE in my country's highest school for now 4 years. Of course I have yet a lot of things to learn about EE, I won't deny it, and yes I hate reading exept manga/comics but I know the concept of linear voltage regulator and power supplies, as opposed to what you're suggesting.
<br />
<br />A voltage regulator needs 1.5V to 2V more than the output voltage to function correctly, in the case of a 7705, it needs 6.5 to 7V as input, if the input will be any higher it will work but this will be a total waste of energy. Therefore, to get a ~7V DC input, you need a 7/sqrt(2) = 4.9 V AC -&gt; 5V AC would work perfectly fine.
<br />
<br />The reason a higher voltage is a waste of power is the following : All the current that the NES uses passes through the regulator and is consummed at the input of the regulator, but at a higher voltage, and Power = Voltage * Current.
<br />For example, if the NES uses 1A of current, the power used by the NES is 5V * 1A = 5W, but the regulator will draw 9*sqrt(2) V * 1A = 12.7W, therefore 12.7-5 = 7.7W will be dissiped as heat, which is plain stupid as I've already said.
<br />
<br />If instead they used a 5V AC -&gt; 7V DC supply, the power consumption would be 7V * 1A = 7W, and only 2W would be dissiped as heat, greatly improving the power ratio of the system from 39% to 71%. A switching supply would improve it further to about 90%.

<br />There is two ways in this world - to give fish or to give fishing rod and teach, how to catch fish.
<br />1)DO NOT mix up AC and DC
<br />2)keep in mind, how filter working and how to choose capacitance proper
<br />3)RTFM and study what is voltage drop
<br />4)keep in mind pulsation and current density in the coils
<br />and all this things just for simple "aincient" linear power supply. Do you think that design of switching power supply is more simple? Oh, boy, i have bad news for you  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />He's right I made an error and forgot to add 1.4V because of the diode bridge, so the minimum "ideal" DC voltage that  should be (7+1.4) / sqrt(2) ~= 6 V AC.
<br />So the true optimal power ratio is not 71% as I stated but more 5 / (7+1.4) = 59%.
<br />
<br />So in our example of the NES using 1A, 5W would be actually used, 6.3W dissipated as heat in the regulator and 1.4W in the diode rectifier : It's arguably pretty bad.
<br />
<br />Also, I considered the reservoir capacitor after the diode bridge was sufficiently high to neglect the voltage drop between two maximas - if this is not the case you just need to increase the capacitor's value.
<br />
<br />I never stated a switching power supply would be simpler - I said it would greatly improve the power ratio and therefore dissipate less heat, solving martinalpal80's problem.
<br />Even if you limit yourself to a classical linear power supply, 70% power ratio is possible but Nintendo went for 39% instead, which <strong>is</strong> a bad design choice, unless you can proof me otherwise with arguments instead of misplaced arrogance.
<br />
<br />You're right to point this probably didn't exit yet back in the 80s, but today they make regulators that fits in those TO package and that use switching technology so that they doesn't dissipate heat - and I'd consider replacing the 7705 by such a chip in the NES.
