It would be far less work to rework a few signals on a licensed game or find a bootleg. To top it off, in very small quantities few people would say the sacrifice is morally reprehensible; personally I only have a problem with it when people sacrifice games for profit in "repros".

<br />
<br />Yeah that's the easier said than done part I was suggesting.  Honestly if those clones will work for you they would be the easiest to work with and the better option.  They aren't just simple chips like your used to.  But basically you can design up your logic schematics on the computer or code the logic in a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL.  Then you program you're "circuit" onto the CPLD via a USB programmer and now the CPLD is configured for whatever you designed it to be.  Not sure if it helps but here's a basic video of a guy using a Lattice CPLD.  I'd probably recommend Xilinx or Altera though.
<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtmVZwZNrM&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJtmVZwZNrM&amp;feature=related</a>
<br />
<br />The basic idea is to reverse engineer the MMC1 and then program it's onto a CPLD.  Something as simple as the MMC1 should fit on a CPLD that only costs a few bucks.  If you're completely unfamiliar you'd have to do some research about them and perhaps find a dev board to learn on and play around with.  This is one of the main goals of the NESDEV1 cart I'm working on right now.  To provide a CPLD on a cart that's already set up for you.  Then people on here could play around with it and perhaps create a library for ourselves of mappers.  Then making it easier to design things like your multicarts that only need one chip for the mapper rom selector and everything.

<br />
<br />Depends...  If it was a one off and you're on the NES no.   Keep in mind retrozone doesn't have FC boards.  For someone like FARID whose etching his  own boards, working on the FC, and has to deal with international shipping I would say yes.  Not only that but it would be of a great use for his multicarts, being able putting all the added rom switching logic he's designed on the CPLD along with the MMC1.  
<br />
<br />Really the versatility is unmatched and is what would allow for prices to be lowered.  You would be able to  design a mapper generic board to be made in larger quantities on the cheap.  Which is what got bunnyboy his prices his MMC1 CPLD (XC9572-15PCG44C) goes from $5.25 at single quantities to $3.85 each for 100 on Digikey anyways.  
<br />
<br />This all comes at the additinal cost of learning how to use CPLDs however which isn't something that's very user friendly at the moment especially for the nesdev community.

<br />Which means he's selling the ReproPak MMC1 at near marginal cost: compare the ReproPak (board only; 74HC161 sold separately) at $4 to the ReproPak MMC1 (with CPLD soldered on) at $9. Any reductions past that would probably have to come from cutting PCB manufacture/shipping cost.

It probably would even fit in NES cart case. It just very unconvient for mass production, and CPLD or custom IC technologies allow to save number of parts, board space, and ultimately the cost.
<br />
<br />Also, some FPGA tools allow to use schematics input, i.e. you just visually draw schematics using logic blocks instead of writing logical model of your device as code. I wonder if it is available for CPLDs as well. It would remove need of Verilog/VHDL knowledge for such small projects.

<br />
<br />I don't think a hand full of logic IC's could come close to beating a $4 CPLD in any respect for MMC1.
<br />
<br />As for the CPLDs and schematic program-ability YES.  I'm actually working on it right now with a Xilinx CPLD.  I'll be posting it up when I've got progress to share on it.  That's one of the big goals for the NESDEV1 dev cart for it's users.

It carries 36 macrocells, and my implementation requires 46 macrocells.<br />Keep in mind that MMC1 is serially loaded, which requires internal serial-parallel conversion; a shift register and a simple finite-state machine.<br /><br />MMC2, 4 are not complex either, but require more pins, as they are loaded in parallel.<br />Anyway, so far I don't plan to work on these mappers, so I can't say if a XC9536 will suit them.<br /><br />The most popular SEGA Master System mapper does seem to fit, though.
