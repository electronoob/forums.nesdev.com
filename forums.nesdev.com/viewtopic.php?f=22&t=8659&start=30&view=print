When I played it, though (up through level 20, I think) the thing that started to stand out was your level design.  It's really some of the best I've seen in a homebrew.  I really liked how you use the wrapping of the screen to get to otherwise out-of-reach places.  The one level where you had fall through the floor to get to the platform above really made me grin.  I basically liked everything except the music.  Sorry man, it was just kind of grating to me.  Everything else was awesome, though.

<br />
<br />Driar is a really great game. Thats why i'm making my ow repro using a Famicom cart (game works perfect) and I wanted to share with you the visuals i'm making for the cart and the boxart:

<br />I don not intend to sell it obviously and it will be presented on my website: <a href="http://www.cccproject.fr" class="postlink">CCCProject.fr</a> along with my other repro carts and geeky stuff.

But if you play Driar, you'll see that there are pink enemies that really resemble a mix of the two (the french fries holder and the cup of soda).
<br />
<br />I'm not the author of the drawings, but i've modified them enough so they're not as i got them (ie: the one used for Driar wasn't pink neither did he have a  different colored belly and hands). I wanted Driar to have a scared/i-don't-have-a-clue look as i thought it went well with the spirit of the game.

<br />That wasn't any original text from the makers, I just made it up. Thought that was appropriate.

Only difference is I think the original leaves the game in 1scA mirroring the entire time, but the game didn't obviously use it.
<br />
<br />The ips file just patches the routine that wrote to $E000 on the MMC1 with a 8-entry lookup table, saving and restoring the X register, and an indirect write.

I know jayminer released it as CC-BY-NC, but I went and double-checked it was OK first. The archive includes both the PAL and the single-byte-changed-for-NTSC version. I haven't bothered to use any automatic region detecting code, that's a more invasive modification. edit: Absolutely nothing except padding was removed (and the MMC1 banking code which was replaced with UNROM banking code)<br /><br />edit2: You should download the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=8659&amp;p=101983#p101983" class="postlink">fixed UNROM build here</a> or the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=8659&amp;p=103147#p103147" class="postlink">NROM build here</a>
