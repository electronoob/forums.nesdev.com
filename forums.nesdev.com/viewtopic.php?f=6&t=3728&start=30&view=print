I knew that the MSb of the decimal place would determine rounding, but I wasn't thinking when it came to defining the extra byte. So yeah, just add the carry after shifting (the MSb will be in the carry, and if you need to round down it will be 0, adding nothing, and it will be 1 for rounding up, adding one, which will all work out in your favor).<br /><br />But where did the number 13 come from?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Anders_A wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I generated alot of semi notes aswell for vibrato (thanks bregalad for that great idea!), but I did use your table for comparison after generation just in case I got something wrong.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Bregalad: Did you try having 15 seminotes between each note instead of 31?

<br />
<br />That's actually what I have too. I can bend a pitch by x/32 of a note. I just have a look up table where each entry is the difference between two tones divided by 32. If I want to bend a pitch up by 7/32, I find the difference between that note and the next /32, multiply it by 7, and add it to the original pitch.
<br />
<br />I was able to fit mine in &lt;128 bytes, with some shifting.

As far as I've been concerned since I've learned how to work with the sound regs, you just plop a value in and it makes a sound. And plus, I always just set the registers to play a constant sound so I can manually adjust the volume for envelopes, and manually silence them.</div>
<br />
<br />Ahaha... I can help you with that. Well, the most basic thing you have to know is that musical notes works in a exponetial manner (in regard to frequency), and hopefully for us, rising to an octave higher only require to double the frequency, or, in our case because we mess with timers (period = 1/F) you just have to divide by two (read: LSR) your value to be put in a period register <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  
<br />
<br />
<br />To calculate exact things, nothing beat a mathematic formula. Because frequency grows exponentially when notes goes up, the formula has to be of exponential type, more precisely in base two. Because there is already a reference in music (A4 = 440 Hz) that would be not much of a trouble calculating the frequency, if you can 'digitalise' note. So, given a system where:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Note = octave + semi-tones/12 + cents/100</div><br />So A 4 = 4 + 9/12 = 4.75, the formula is as easy as:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Frequency = 440 Hz * 2^&#40;note - 4.75&#41;</div><br />And there's its reciprocal:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Note = log2&#40;frequency/440 Hz&#41; + 4.75</div>
<br />That things beat every table you'll find on the net. Of course, we don't like wasting time on the NES calculating that thing, so a small look-up table of 11 elements is sufficient, since getting the other octaves simply uses LSR,. And because I think you're lazy, I even made a Excel sheet that does the job for you, plus calculate the value to write to the register and even calculate the error. <a href="http://jarhmander.home.googlepages.com/f2n.xls" class="postlink">http://jarhmander.home.googlepages.com/f2n.xls</a>

<br />Turns out to be useful in more ways than one.  I was tracing through a game today (my first one ever actually!), specifically through the sound engine and I actually found their table of note/tone values!  It was like an "Aha!" moment for me.  They had slightly different values from the ones in your chart, but they were close enough that it was obvious what it was.  I wonder how they calculated their values, since they were a bit different from the ones on your chart...
<br />
<br />Anyway, if I hadn't printed out your chart beforehand, I might have missed it completely and written question marks in my notes.  What a life saver!
<br />
<br />It's all coming together.  This NES sound stuff is starting to make sense to me.  Thanks again!

<br />
<br />So how off were the values? Did they vary from more than to less than for each entry? Or perhaps they tweaked it by hand to see if rounding up/down made it sound better. It could also be a precision thing where mine has more or less precision than theirs.

<br />
<br />They were pretty close.  I don't even know how to begin to calculate if they vary at a constant rate or not.  I'd bet that your values are the more precise ones, since you followed the formula and tested the sounds with a tuner. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />   The game (The Guardian Legend, btw) doesn't sound out of tune to my ears though.  I haven't finished tracing the sound engine, so I don't know yet if the game fudges around with the values before committing them to the sound registers.  I have seen them write the values to the corresponding sound reg copies in RAM though.
<br />
<br />Here are the values from their chart, laid out next to your chart (just the first two octaves.  I don't want to annoy people with a long post):

<br />
<br />Hmm, those values look like they could be slightly out of tune... Does the game manipulate those values at all before storing them into the sound regs? It could be for pre-arpeggio purposes. Otherwise, it's possible they are all in tune with each other, but just a little flat as a whole.
