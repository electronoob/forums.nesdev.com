<br />If I remember correctly, the layout of the logo is stored at the end of CHR-ROM. So make sure you have implemented CHR-ROM reading through $2007 (including the 1-byte delay) and that it returns valid data (based on the tiles we can see, there appears to be something wrong with your tile decoding).
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oops, tepples beat me to it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The SMB Logo data is stored in CHR-ROM. To appear you must implement reading from CHR-ROM via register $2007. And other games need it to behave properly, I believe Mario bros (not super) needs to be able to read it or else no objects (player or enemy) collide with the level.

<br />No, you didn't get it. Those are the tiles used to draw the logo, but the data that specifies how to arrange those tiles is stored in CHR-ROM as well. It's in the screwed up tiles from $EC on. They look screwed up because they are not NES tiles, they are data.
<br />
<br />It was stored there becuse the programmers were out of PRG-ROM space. This was a common trick used by games (specially CNROM ones, mapper 3) that had some free space for data in the CHR-ROM. Being part of the CHR area, the CPU can't access it directly, it needs to set the address through $2006 and read the data from $2007. What you must implement is this reading from CHR-ROM/VRAM, or else the game can't retrieve the data it needs in order to arrange the tiles correctly.

<br />That makes a lot of sense. so it is reading the data from the PRG-ROM then writes it to ram (From what I got while trying to figure it out myself in the FCE Debugger) then to the Name table Through 2006?

<br />You probably meant CHR-ROM, so yeah. I remember it reading from there, buffering in RAM and then writing to the Name Table.

<br />I fixed 2007 reads, and I can see that it IS reading the data now, but it still doesn't show up on the screen. Further debugging is required I suppose
