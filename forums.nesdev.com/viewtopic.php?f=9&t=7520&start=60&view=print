I did have to modify the source code a bit for gcc though and was swearing for at least an hour trying to link with Boost. But finally this command line did it:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">g++ -o pc2nes -I./nrpc-1.2a1 -I/usr/include/boost -L/usr/lib Main.cpp nrpc-1.2a1/nrpc/*.c* -pthread -lboost_system</div><br /><br />To my disappointment though, transfer was started with a black screen, but once done and resetting I just got back to the same boot program... after soldering the tied-up wires properly and starting to think if the cable had ended up too long, I figured I'd try changing the define to use 57600 bps instead of 115200. And it got me halfway to a &quot;SENDING PRG&quot; message... soon thereafter I figured out the program was ignoring the define in the later transfers, and after fixing that it looks like I can finally enjoy eprom emulator development speed on a Powerpak <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Additionally, FCEUX seems to work in Wine nowadays (didn't last time I tried) so I'm switching to Linux again, maybe for good this time.<br /><br />I'm attaching the patch to use lo-speed and make the source gcc-friendly. Since compatibility is good and hi-speed transfer obviously seems to give problems for some of us, I'd suggest it to go into the main release as well, but that's up to TheFox of course <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for the late reply. I have now tested it on both my PAL and my NTSC NES. They both give the same results: 57600 works fine while 115200 fails completely. <br /><br />I am a bit curious as to why of course. Since other people haven't reported any such problems with the Dealextreme cable, it could just be my computr or Ubuntu limiting it in some weird way. Or slightly more far-fetched: maybe the length of the cable actually starts to matter at this higher speed? <br /><br />When I get some visitor with a different computer I could try the first two theories, and since I bought two cables I have yet another one for testing the second theory when I'm bored enough to do some more soldering...

Maybe the USB-serial adapter doesn't like having the rate changed before it's finished sending all its data at 57600. The patch ensures that 115200 isn't switched to ever if it's not being used. It'd probably be best to just wrap the whole 115200 portion in a conditional rather than rely on robust serial drivers.

I will release a new version with this fix and a run-time speed switch later. The nice thing is, this could also explain why 115200 transfer wasn't working for Bananmos (the 57600 portion got messed up as the speed was changed mid-transfer), so hopefully that too will work after the fix.<br /><br />As far as I know, asio::write() should block until it has &quot;written&quot; all of the data, but maybe (probably) it returns right after it has handed the data to the driver's buffer, and not until the data has been actually sent. That may also explain the need for the ~100ms delay between transfers I had to put in there to avoid problems with the transfers on my FTDI chip. If that's the case, I'm not sure what's the correct way in boost::asio to wait for the data transfer to actually have finished.
