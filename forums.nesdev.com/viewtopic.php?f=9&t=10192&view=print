PAL60 is often an unofficially supported quasi-standard. The only remaining issue I see is the line rate which at 625/60 would generate an 18.7KHz video signal which might be out of range for a TV set.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The easiest way to get PAL60 would probably be to get an RGB NES and rig up an RGB to PAL encoder.<br /><br />Here's how it was done in the real world: PAL-M is a variant of PAL60 with a lower color burst frequency that fits better into the &quot;M&quot; band plan used with NTSC. Brazil used it before the 2007 digital switchover. The NES sold in Brazil had an NTSC PPU and a daughterboard that decoded NTSC and encoded PAL-M. Some sets support both PAL-M and PAL60; others don't.

I too hope someone here can shed some light on how PAL60 actually works.

I might be wrong though, other people could confirm or deny this.</div><br />Yes. PAL60 is normally defined as 525 lines, 60Hz, using PAL colour encoding. What you'd get from an overclocked PAL NES wouldn't be PAL60, because it'd be 625 lines, 60Hz, using PAL colour encoding. I was using PAL60 as an example to illustrate that deviating from the official standard doesn't always mean things will horribly break. In fact, dual-sync, tri-sync or multisync monitors with a composite input will probably accept the signal without issue. The main question is just how lenient your average consumer CRT TV is. I remember messing around with PowerStrip on a PC with a Radeon card connected to a simple VGA-to-SCART cable, and found that I could increase the scan rate quite a bit above 15KHz before the picture would start rolling on my Philips TV. It could be that 18KHz is too high, but you wouldn't know unless you tried.<br /><br />It's an interesting experiment for sure, if you don't mind risking a few hardware components in the process. I wouldn't shoot it down just because the video signal output isn't going to conform to a defined video standard.
