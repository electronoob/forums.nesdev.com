Depending on the assembler of course you could generate lookup tables using the assembly language; how it is done depends on the assembler. I know Unofficial-MagicKit can do a lot and apparently ca65 can also it (but I don't know how); for other assemblers I don't know but you can try to look at the documentation to see if it explains such things.<br /><br />Using features of text editor is also possible but that depends on what text editor you are using. Same with other programs, although it certainly can be done too. Maybe even SQLite could be usable for such purpose.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Or should I make a polyfill that abstracts over the differences between cscript and Node, use cscript on Windows, and require Node only on Linux and Mac?<br /></div>It seems like that might help, so you might see if that can be done easily enough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Sat Jan 31, 2015 10:37 pm</p><hr />

I know it is a terrible language, especially for this particular application, and there is many more adapted languages out there, but in the end I'd save time doing it in C just because I am so used to using it. Even if I wanted to use the C++ extensions I'd loose time because I'd have to look up for how you use std::cout, because I don't remember, so I end up using C anyways.<br /><br />When I was a student I used to using java, now I'd never want to code in this language ever again, because it is absolutely awful and even worse than C in all aspects, cumulating C's problems with other problems made up especially for it. The only great thing about java is that it detects the buffer overflows problem instead of crashing or making segfaults. Other scripting languages such as Perl looks awesome, but I only used those a couple of times to try something, and it'd take forever to remember how to use Perl to do some basic operation. I had no idea JScript and VScript even existed. I though Java Script was only for web pages, I am surprised you could do a non-web application with it. Although if you use Java Script so often at work, I pefectly understand why you'd want to use this for an application where JavaScript was not supposed to be adapted, just to win time.<br /><br />Sorry to have gotten completely off-topic.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jan 29, 2015 3:03 pm</p><hr />

You're asking if you could highlight one thing and make the word processor replace all the parts in the document that have that string of text with what you replaced with what you highlighted? (If that makes sense.) Also, about a magic table editor, I don't think (or at least I've never seen one) they exist.<br /><br />Oh, about generating tables, I currently just write them manually. Thinking about it, (and I'm not being sarcastic) Microsoft Excel might be good at creating tables. I obviously know it creates different type of table, but you can use math functions and it works in a grid. (It also does what I said earlier, if I remember correctly.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Wed Jan 28, 2015 11:33 pm</p><hr />

I am working on learning how to use sprites so I am making a lot of edits to long lists like this <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">sprites:<br />   ;vert tile attr horiz<br />.db $08, $00, $00, $a4<br />.db $08, $01, $00, $c9<br />.db $08, $02, $00, $84<br />.db $10, $03, $00, $88</div><br /><br />with 64 entries<br /><br />Does anyone happen to know of a tool to generate tables like this or to modify existing ones is for example, I want to change the tile number of every sprite but keep everything else the same or put in 64 random values between X and Y into the first column without having to manually edit all 64 lines of code?<br /><br />If not how are you guys generating your tables?<br /><br />Thanks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6063">lazerbeat</a> — Wed Jan 28, 2015 11:19 pm</p><hr />
