<div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I also got a LENKENG SCART (RGB/composite) to HDMI converter, which isn't so expensive and is said to handle 240p video just fine.<br /></div><br />After several months of waiting (really, I bought this thing back in August!), my LKV362A finally arrived. Man, what a letdown.<br /><br />I first tried the RGB from my US Genesis (transcoded to PAL-M back in the 90's) and my Japanese Mega Drive (bought used a couple years ago, not sure if it's NTSC or PAL-M). Both behaved exactly the same: the video was a little snowy (random white dots easily noticeable in black screens), was very saturated and had some sort of interference in the form of dark stripes scrolling from the bottom to the top of the screen. The generated HDMI signal switched inconsistently between 50Hz and 60Hz. Switching to 1080 caused all sorts of glitches (half the screen filled with blinking garbage). In addition to that, the audio was absolute shit, with loud humming (louder than the actual sound) and random distortions depending on what was playing.<br /><br />Then I tried the composite video from the Genesis/MD. Complete shit. It was the blurriest picture I had ever seen coming out of a video game console, and that includes a 2600 connected through RF to an 80's TV. Colors were still oversaturated, the framerate was still unstable and the audio was still the same crap.<br /><br />Then I tried the SNES. The SCART cable I bought simply didn't work. I tried it on 2 original models and a Jr. (all PAL-M), no picture at all. Composite worked much better than with the Genesis/MD, but the result was practically the same as what the TV does by itself, which means that blinking sprites are still &quot;stripy&quot; or translucent.<br /><br />So, the converter ended up being a piece of shit device that didn't improve anything. For some reason it hates all my Genesis/MD consoles, doesn't help with the progressive/interlaced issue, and at best performs the same as my TV's internal converter. I was too disappointed to test it with any more consoles, and I'll probably just leave it rotting in its box forever. Now that was a waste of money.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jan 15, 2015 6:35 am</p><hr />

I tried a second hand DVD recorder as a converter and it does okay - this is probably the cheapest route. I think it fixed the dropped frames, but it converts to 480i, which causes everything to look a little off when scrolling, but is tolerable. It can also convert to 480p, which looks good, but the frame bounces. Maybe a slightly better DVD recorder will do the trick. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jozwdYF0K-E" class="postlink">This is the 480i component signal</a> captured. Pretty sure it introduced significant lag though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4680">Movax12</a> — Fri Jul 18, 2014 4:34 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, my LCD TV skips 2 frames about every 10 seconds to catch up with the NES' out-of-spec frame timing, very easy to notice during smooth scrolling. It does two frames at once because it's 480i displayed at 30hz.<br /><br />I tried the composite-into-component trick and the component input still says 480i, so, I guess that's not an option for me. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Maybe someday when I have a job again I'll splurge on one of those $300 Japanese upscaling machines...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Fri Jul 18, 2014 3:57 pm</p><hr />

Yeah, pretty much that's the issue I was talking about. The idea was to have the upscaler do the frame dropping though just in case a TV goes bonkers with the non-standard refresh rate.<br /><br />For the record, PC monitors may be better for this, since they don't expect a very specific refresh rate. In fact Nvidia is working on a technology where the refresh rate is variable (i.e. data is not sent unless the screen changes), monitors supporting that would be probably ideal for this purpose since they'd be designed to take anything (within a certain wide margin at least). As a bonus you get better picture quality than a TV.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Fri Jul 18, 2014 10:13 am</p><hr />
