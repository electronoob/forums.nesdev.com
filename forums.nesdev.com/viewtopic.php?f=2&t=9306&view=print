		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, I installed NESICIDE on Windows 7 64-bit by:<br /><br />1. Installing GNUMAKE from NESICIDE website<br />2. Installing cc65 snapshot from NESICIDE website<br />3. Installing NESICIDE from NESICIDE website<br />4. Manually adding &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\cc65-snapshot\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\cc65-snapshot\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin&quot; to Owner and System PATH variable<br /><br />I started NESICIDE and picked new project -&gt; NROM Hello World Project and gave it the folder C:\Projects\HelloWorld<br /><br />It opened a clean new project.  So clean I didn't see any assets at all.  I created a new source file named main.c and copied the example from here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://rpgmaker.net/tutorials/227/">http://rpgmaker.net/tutorials/227/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />When I tried to compile NESICIDE complained about a linker file:<br />Nothing to build, no linker config file specified. Go to Project menu, select Project Properties, and switch to the Linker tab to add one.<br /><br />I tried just copying the nes.cfg from the AlterEgo project but that didn't compile.<br /><br />Was the NROM Hello World template supposed to be blank with no linker file?  How do I get the tutorial from RPGMaker.Net to compile?

How do I get the tutorial from RPGMaker.Net to compile?</div><br />It seems you've stumbled onto an avenue of the tool that I started to pave but never completed.  I was intending for there to be various project templates, of which a NROM-based &quot;Hello World&quot; project would be one.  The intent was for the tool to populate everything you'd need -- linker map, source, CHR data -- to produce a simple demo that did nothing more than put &quot;hello world&quot; on the screen.<br /><br />I never achieved internal consensus on the best way to store such project templates in the environment.  I have everything I need...just need to pick the best way to store them.  I think the answer will be &quot;they'll be compressed archives in some subfolder of the program's installation.<br /><br />You headed in the right direction, though...I don't know why the RPGMaker source wouldn't compile...I didn't write it.  I don't know if it's meant to be compiled with CC65 or not.  I can take a look later tonight.<br /><br />I can probably get the project template thing done soonish.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the reply!<br /><br />It does indeed compile with the instructions provided in that RPGMaker.Net link.  Here is the command line used:<br />cl65 -L C:\NES\lib -t nes -I C:\NES\include *.c -o hello.nes<br /><br />It uses the include and lib folder from cc65 as well.<br /><br />I don't quite understand what a linker file is.  It seems to define what rom/ram configuration the binary should use?  I'm not sure what a basic one for a cc65 &quot;Hello World&quot; example would look like.<br /><br />Other than that, using the steps posted previously, the Tepples-SNROM and EXRAM examples do not compile.  I'd rather get the Hello World NROM working if I had my druthers ^_^<br /><br />Thanks again for this awesome tool!

Also I am very close to including working template project generation.  I hope to have a version out this weekend with both of those.  That should address the Tepples-SNROM and EXRAM example problems too.<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback!
