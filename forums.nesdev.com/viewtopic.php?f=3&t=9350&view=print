		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm kinda wondering about the question of whether to use a submapper, or assign a new mapper. Forgive me if this has already been said, but to me, it seems the only important value of the submapper field is that it will be ignored by emulators that don't support iNES 2.0, allowing them to fall back on a &quot;mostly compatible&quot; version of the mapper.<br /><br />I don't know if you share my line of reasoning here, but I think it leads to the following two principles:<br /><br />- If a game already has an assigned mapper, don't change it, because there's already an iNES 1.0 fallback implementation.<br />- Don't introduce submappers that can't acceptably fall back to the iNES 1.0 version of that mapper. (Assign a new mapper instead.)<br /><br /><br />I also like the idea that submapper 0 just means the default iNES 1.0 handling. I think this also suggests:<br /><br />- All submappers except 0 must unambiguously specify a single implementation, and not be dependent on external configurations like PRG / CHR / CRC.<br />- All iNES 1.0 mappers that have ambiguities resolved by external configurations must be given a submapper for each case that needs resolution.<br /><br /><br />Finally, iNES 2.0 only mappers (mappers 256+) have no concern for iNES 1.0 backward compatibility. For these, it should be acceptable to group related mappers by submapper. For instance, the proposed 1-chip mapper has a lot of jumper configurations which could be presented as submappers of, say, mapper 257.<br /><br /><br />I'm proposing these guidelines in the interest of needing less arbitration about what to do in various cases. (Personally, I don't have much stake in it anyway, since I'm really quite happy living within the confines of iNES 1.0 for my own purposes.)<br /><br /><br />Another question re: the proposal on the wiki: if you're going to have an option to force NINA for mapper 34, why not also have an option to force BNROM? What is the Union Bond mapper? (Does it have a 5 bit latch?)

This is pure speculation though.

I suspect that there are plenty &quot;mapper 0&quot; roms that aren't NROM (things like the Game Genie bios, for example). If there are too many such mapper 0 variants then the 15 submapper numbers won't be enough ro resolve that mess, using 256 and 512 would extend available space for &quot;NROM&quot; variants.<br />But then it would need to be defined/reserved for that purpose right NOW. So that emulator programmers can implement the required &quot;fallback on mapper 0&quot; - else the fallback trick would work only for very-old NES 1.0 emus, while the current NES 2.0 emus would see 256 as unsupported mapper.

That'll be needed to be puzzled into the submapper definitions, too. The VRC2 won't match too well with the &quot;treat submapper bits as address lines&quot; stuff. Would have been better to use submappers 1 and 2 for VRC4 variants, instead of doing that address-line mapping.<br /><br />And the submapper page chapters should be better strictly sorted by mapper numbers. At the moment some entries are filed under board names like VRC4 and MMC1, and others are filed under mapper numbers. That's confusing, and VRC4 as chapter name doesn't work out for cases like the shared VRC4+VRC2 mapper number.

The only thing is that unlike the 255- mappers, when run as iNES 1.0 they're going to fall back to a random mapper. Not a great error condition.<br /><br />I dunno what I'd suggest, though. We could reserve another 8 bits for extended mapper number, and make them all use the same iNES 1.0 mapper number. At least then, something more predictable could happen.

And emulators should adopt their behaviour.<br />Does anybody know how original copiers did handle the trainer bit? I would suspect that they did destroy the first 512 bytes of saved battery ram (if they did support saving at all), and did overwrite it by the &quot;trainer&quot; data (?)
