I suggest a few rule additions:<br /><br /><ul><li>The main category is for games. In the past, judges have found it difficult to judge entries that aren't games. Thus tools and toys should go in the free-for-all category even if they fit the mapper and size requirements.</li><li>Excessive padding is discouraged. For example, an entry's 10 KiB of PRG data shouldn't be strewn across a 32 KiB PRG ROM; it should instead be packed into 16 KiB. Nor should a CNROM have two CHR ROM banks that are less than half full; NROM with $2000 switching is usually better for that situation. This helps ensure more entries can fit on the multicart.</li><li>The blurb should contain instructions for the multicart menu to display. This is up to 16 lines, each roughly 28 characters long. </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think we need to be cautious of having overly specific requirements of technical and/or game style demands from entrants.  <br /><br />Initialization issues are extremely common, and we're always going to desire some compressing.  Having good documentation on do's and do not's for developers to review when questions arise is always good.  Just don't want to make a big deal about it to the point where it might deter new developers from submitting entries.  If we go to the point of demanding technical items of this nature I think we'll scare people away especially if they're not as experienced.  <br /><br />I think it would be much more beneficial to provide guidance, or perhaps boiler plate code that does perform suggested startup.  Going about it in tone of here's some help, and code you're welcome to use is more inviting.  Compared to stringent technical requirements a novice may not even understand which could make them feel they don't belong.<br /><br />Perhaps a good time to direct entrants to the technical list of dos and dont's is after they submit their entry and are awaiting judging.  Allow them to submit their efforts even if they haven't made time to compress their entry yet.  Having these things well documented to avoid having the same conversation multiple times should make it easier for all.<br /><br />I have a hard time imagining a successful compo on par with last year's if we require all competing entries to be 4 player.  Making 4 player a requirement still doesn't make judging them easier.  In general suggestive themes haven't worked out for us in the past in the form of sub-compo either.<br /><br />Something to keep in mind is that we probably will be hitting our 53 game target with this compo.  I think we actually hit 53 entries last compo, but I guess tools don't count.  Anyway, if there's something specific we have in mind for the big cart, probably good to address it this compo.<br /><br />Overall last year's compo was a great success on many accounts.  I'm of the mind that we can copy paste last year's rules, etc for the most part.  And make sure we announce it on NA, as that was the biggest real issue we had.  If there's something that needs changing lets get it addressed.  But the direction we were looking for is to have an annual schedule that can be copy pasted from one year to the next.  Without letting deliberations on what we should do this time drag on to the point where they delay the compo.<br /><br />That's my $0.02 take it or leave it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

Initializing absolutely everything isn't.<br /><br />The menu needs to set the outer bank, inner bank, game size, and default register (CNROM: CHR bank; others: inner PRG bank), and jump to the game's entry point. The last of these need to be done in RAM because the menu bank is no longer visible. And I can't make code in RAM clear itself; it's not like loading an SPC700 saved state (.spc) on the Super NES, where the last steps of the process can execute out of the I/O ports. Would it be enough to clear nametables, clear $0000-$00F7 and $0100-$07FF to value $FF, and leave eight bytes of code at $00F8-$00FF?<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; clrzploop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; sta $00,x<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; dex<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; bne clrzploop<br />&nbsp; jmp entrypoint<br /></div><br /><br />Another thing we could try is to provide a stand-alone version of the ROM builder, so that a developer can test how a game will behave when added to a collection. For this, I might need someone's help with <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2exe/" class="postlink">py2exe</a>.

For PRG ROM, I can fit two NROM-128 entries into one 32K bank using the autosubmulti script, which (ab)uses UNROM (2) and UNROM (180) to mirror 16K into both the top and bottom halves of the bank.
