		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Unfortunately I come only as an idea man here, but I would love to see a comprenhensive and organized nsf archive. One that offers a level of organization and functionality that's more up to speed with something like <a href="http://www.exotica.org.uk/wiki/UnExoticA" class="postlink">unexotica</a> or <a href="http://project2612.org/" class="postlink">project 2612</a> (although I know the latter isn't a wiki).
<br />
<br />Nsf archives are a bit too disjointed. Some confused folk will still look to zophar. Then there was akumu's nsf archive, and now there is knurek's which as far as is I know is only available in a bulk zip. There is also arc-nova, but it only has the game titles like akumu's archive (although is much more up to date!).
<br />
<br />I don't mean to sound too critical of anyone's efforts, but I think we could do something much better as a collective. Something that'd make it easy for everyone to come together and contribute their new rips and information.
<br />
<br />Having information fields that are each browsable- where you could click on composer or company names and find all nsfs indexed as such would be great. Including both m3u and NSFE files. Allowing for a 'notes' section that would offer whether or not track names are official or unofficial. Offer more information on how the composers were specifically credited in-game, point out known errors or relevant details about the nsf, etc. There could be a section for known games that still unripped, maybe have information on why...
<br />
<br />The reason a wiki format would be best, is that everyone who could be trusted with contributing could be given some sort of admin status to make updates. For example, in tagging a bunch of nsfes I often find composer information in game credits that aren't already in the original nsf. As it stands now, I can update an nsf myself, but what good does that do for anyone else? Would knurek update his entire archive just because I added 'Neil Baldwin' to Drop Zone or 'Kyohei Sada' for Palamedes 2? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> Right now there is no easy and organized way to share these sort of updates with the whole community and that's what needs to change.
<br />
<br />TLDR - A sort of 'ultimate nsf archive' would be awesome! One that embraces having more information and more ways to index / search. Thoughts? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />One thing that I would like to make clear is a division between classic game and new nsfs. But we could do it all. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Perhaps an an alphabetical index on the left for game nsfs with a header like "Classic Game Soundtracks", and another index below or link for "Artist Pages"...?
<br />
<br />This is a rough version of something I put together the other day for how the game nsfs could possibly be organized -
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://filefreakout.com/pmwiki_nsf/pmwiki.php?n=Site.1-9">http://filefreakout.com/pmwiki_nsf/pmwi ... n=Site.1-9</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Comments / criticisms on how that is laid out? Of course nsfs on the artist pages wouldn't be displayed like this, just game nsfs...
<br />
<br />I would want most fields to be clickable, like you could click on "Nobuo Uematsu" and get an alphabetized list of all his stuff on the archive. 
<br />
<br />I was thinking the game title wouldn't directly link to the nsf, but a page about the nsf that'll link to the nsf, m3u and nsfe (if available). Then in the page there'll be room for more notes and information than displayed in the index, like more specific credits than "composer" if they exist, # of tracks and if sfx are included, if track titles from the playlist are official or not, who the ripper and taggers are, and an optional comments field if there are known errors, oddities, or updates. We can get fancy and put up title screen screenshots and really make this pretty. This I don't have a rough example of yet, though.
<br />
<br />I would like to use Knurek's archive as a foundation for especially the game portion of the site, so before we start dumping all his stuff I'd like to make sure he's cool with it, and more importantly, in on it...
<br />
<br />I also just purchased nsfarchive.com for 4 years, we can use that once this launches for real.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here are my suggestions:
<br />
<br />1. Listener feedback for each file - It would be very interesting to allow comments for each file.  If a musician wants feedback, the only other option is a forum post on 2a03.org or here.  But once those disappear into page 45 of 309 on a forum, it's dead and buried.  It can be surprising, with some .XM files I've gotten really interesting comments even 10+ years after making them, because my email address listed in it still worked.
<br />
<br />2. Archive can be later converted to a simplified version - Because people will want to download it, and also because I want to eventually do FTP access from my NES.  And the first thing I want it to do is be able to download NSF files.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />YouTube allows comments on each video, and I've seen a lot of videos whose comments degenerate into idiocy. Would it be possible to avoid this? And would it be desirable?

Assuming this catches on, it should work out pretty well.

<br />
<br />Some of the information contained there is presented via wiki, but most is not.  There's even a torrent for the whole set (that is updated when there are new updates).
<br />
<br />If something like that would work, you may even be able to talk whoever runs and hosts the SNES version into hosting an NES version as well, although the NES community would need to update the data obviously.
