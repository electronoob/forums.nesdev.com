		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Could you clarify your &quot;no&quot;? My understanding is that a proper interlaced signal basically has a flag every other frame (never mind how it's encoded) that causes the display to offset the field half a scanline vertically, and that these these offset and non-offset fields are referred to as even and odd (again, irrelevant which is which for this post). The NES doesn't set this flag every other field, and thus the TV always displays the same field every frame. Hence my comment, it shows the same field (even/odd, not relevant here which) every frame. The same field implies that its scanlines are always on the same physical position on the CRT face, since that's what the even/odd means.

Yes, a given CRT will have more prominent space between the scanlines when displaying a 240p signal than when displaying a 480i signal. No, that doesn't make the signal any less 240p, just as a 350-<span class="posthilit">line</span> picture from a VGA card in full-screen EGA-compatible mode doesn't suddenly become 700p with every other <span class="posthilit">line</span> blank when displayed on a VGA monitor tuned for 768p.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are no flags, only thing that causes interlaced signal is a half <span class="posthilit">line</span>. That half <span class="posthilit">line</span> causes a &quot;restart&quot; in the horizontal ramp generator. Ramp is fed to the deflection circuit and it moves the beam. Side effect of that half <span class="posthilit">line</span> is that new <span class="posthilit">line</span> will be half a <span class="posthilit">line</span> shifted down, and the newly coming lines will end up between the old ones. Remember that there is always a <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> ramp happening... it is smooth sawtooth like horizontal one, there are no &quot;staircases&quot; and this is the reason for the half a <span class="posthilit">line</span> <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> shift on the half length horizontal <span class="posthilit">line</span>. If the <span class="posthilit">line</span> is less or more than half then the new field will be shifted as much up or down.<br />If You omit that half <span class="posthilit">line</span> or have even number of them the new field will just go on top of other. Even number will result in equivalent of full lines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />And to a modern digital TV, it is nothing more than a really clunkily-encoded flag (assuming it even recognizes pseudo-progressive signals like the NES puts out). Sorry if this whole thread was too much of an exercise in abstract thinking. It stemmed from my insight that one reason that NES images are generally shown in a way that doesn't match the TV is that these implicit black spaces between scanlines aren't accounted for. By showing how the interlaced fields are effectively skipping lines (sorry, more abstract thinking), and that the NES shows only one kind of interlaced field, it's clearer how there is something more than just 240 scanlines if one is displaying it more how a TV would. For some reason I hadn't thought this all the way through before and hadn't fully registered this essential scanline spacing (even though it was painfully clear on larger CRT TVs how noticeable the black spaces were).

That is the reason why different fields have more half lines, and different amount between the two. It was mainly to help video editing apparatus the function more effectively. For a CRT TV it does not matter, it just works as a consequence, there is no way to mess up field order in any way, as long as there is at least one halfline you are guaranteed to have proper shift on the fields.<br />A friend of mine in working on an upscaler device aimed at retro game consoles and dealing with this problem really is not easy without complex techniques. But since it is retro aimed, it can assume all info is non-interlaced.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In CRT TV all happens much easier. Who of you really know, how works <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> deflection system?<br />1. It's all start from sawtooth generator. It consist of capacitor, constant current generator (for capacitor charge) and capacitor discharge switch. Current generator guarantees linear charging of capacitor. All you need is use switch before the capacitor get full charge. Obviously switch used every VLBank.<br />2. Result of sawtooth generator feeds to amplifier, that drives <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> deflection coils. Nothing special, except very high requirements to linearity of amplifier. That's all.<br />3. TV standard describes different length of even and odd subframes by one scanline. So, VBlank period is a bit different between each other. Now, read back chapter 1: capacitor are same, charging current are stable, so in shorter subframe capacitor get a bit less charge, that cause less voltage on it. Amplifier works only with AC, that cause signal shift output signal relatively zero. This shift is interlace. Notice that if even subframe different by 2 scanlines, that cause only redraw almost all odd scanlines, except one on top and one on bottom. That's why must different be only by one scanline.<br /><img src="http://principact.ru/images/stories/val_img/img_tv_1/tv_3.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://principact.ru/images/stories/val_img/img_tv_1/tv_4.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />Ofcourse this cause jitter of <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> deflection frequency, but average frequency are stable. Thus, there are no &quot;odd/even flag&quot;, and DSP are simple count scanlines between <span class="posthilit">vertical</span> sync. And I remind you my previous words: NES PPU generate every frame with constant scanline count. Is that clear? If you don't believe, you always can read TV standart drafts or even look at oscilloscope at broadcast signal.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is an odd/even flag in an interlaced composite signal. A flag is just something that can be in one of two states; its representation can be anything, not just what one conventionally thinks of as a flag. This kind of flexible thinking allows application of patterns to more situations and thus greater mental abilities. It's true that the even/odd field differentiation wasn't thought of as a flag back when it was created, since it was basically driving the TV's deflection circuit in a sense, causing it to offset half a scanline height. This doesn't prevent us from seeing it as a flag now when reasoning about the signal in the abstract. For the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>, which can do progressive or interlaced based on software control, it is little more than a flag. &quot;If in interlaced mode, every other frame we need to output a special section in the video signal to tell the TV that it's the other field type.&quot;

Your flag is need only for control software to synchronize to video signal. It's generated by video processing device. TV doesn't require any flag. Analog TV get correct picture by natural method, digital TV - just by count scanlines between VSync signal (with additional postprocessing digital TV has output lag). Result of scanlines counting you can consider as your &quot;flag&quot;.
