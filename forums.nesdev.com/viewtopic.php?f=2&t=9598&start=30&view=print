I used 1, perhaps if you use another seed (such as 0) the sequence could be not random at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just checked with GNU octave, and the RNG actually has a sequence of 65536 states, which means it is optimal for a 16-bit RNG (it could technically not get any better with 16-bit). It is also, of course, independant of the seed, since the loop goes through all possible states.<br /><br />I execute this script as a proof :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">x = 0;<br />for i=1:65537;&nbsp; x(i+1) = bitand(x(i)*5 + 0x3611, 0xffff); end;<br />y = bitand(x, 0xff00) / 0x100;<br />% plot(y)<br />find(not(x))&nbsp; &nbsp;% Print when the RNG rolls back to value '0'<br /><br />% Compute the probability of all 256 possible values<br /><br />for i=1:256; z(i) = length(find(not(y-i-1))); end;<br />plot(z)</div><br />It also shows that all values are almost equiprobable for the 8 MSBs.<br /><br />I don't know how you test the RNG, and how you use a bi-dimentional array for it. Would you share the details ? Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I often use quick and dirty random number generators, but to improve randomness I continuously clock the random number generator while waiting for VBlank. Since the time taken to process a frame is pretty random depending on which objects are active and all the actions the engine takes in different frames, that seems to work out well.

	</div><br /><br />The numbers were pulled in pairs of two (X and Y), so if you look at this picture carefully, it basically means that for any given value (0..255, in X axis) returned by the RNG there are only 5-6 different (sequential) values that may follow it, in other words it's very predictable.<br /><br />So it's not a good RNG.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />And I guess that's why commonly used error detection protocols use CRC (based on LFSR) rather than a linear congruential hash like the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10696223/reason-for-5381-number-in-djb-hash-function" class="postlink">DJB hash</a>, right? Part of the drawback of the linear congruential structure is that high-order bits don't cascade back to low-order bits.<br /><br />DJB hash:<br />hash[0] = 5381<br />hash[i + 1] = (33 * hash[i] + data[i]) mod 2^n<br /><br />Why 33? It's a power of two plus or minus one (for quick multiplication) that's close to the number of letters in the Latin alphabet (for good distribution when used to hash strings).

I wonder if you get could even get decent results just incrementing a variable by one during the vblank wait loop.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> I bet you could!<br />edit: <br />Heh. It's true. You can do pretty well! (Probably not well enough, though)<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/eb4Iw.png" alt="Image" /><br />This chart was made by solely incrementing $FF during the Vblank loop. Each pixel was made using the random number from each set of two consecutive frames.<br />Frame 1, frame 2 = point 1's x and y<br />Frame 3, frame 4 = point 2's x and y<br />etc.<br /><br />The very clear diagonal line was caused by me standing completely still. (I didn't have enemies or anything else too variable in the level I used to test, so the processing time was probably pretty stable.)<br /><br />Edit 2: Continuation of the same line:<br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VENC5.png" alt="Image" /><br />My game also has a bug which occasionally makes the game wait for a variable vblank sets rather than the vblank itself. (It halts the program so no new tiles are put into the buffer before the previous one have been updated by the NMI routine),  This caused the second diagonal line. <br /><br />Still, pretty interesting!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some commercial games update a random seed during wait-for-vblank as well, for which Dwedit had a heck of a time computing the exact result for PocketNES speed hacks. Ultimately the time between the end of the game logic and the next vblank is a complicated function of the entire game state, but it's still a function. Incrementing a seed while waiting for vblank is thus still a PRNG, providing no more entropy than any other way of hashing keypresses. I guess that lends credence to the concept of reading the controller dozens of times during menus with little or no animation going on, such as the title screen, to gather more entropy.

It's also testably-reliable, whereas something depending on hardware might generate low-quality numbers in some circumstances.
