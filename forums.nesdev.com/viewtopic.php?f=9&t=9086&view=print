<br />As far as I can tell, once you're using RAM at all anywhere in the system — and for modern homebrews that's probably CHR RAM — you should just increase its size and battery-back it instead to get saving capability. The cost of the battery, diodes, resistors and capacitor to battery back a SRAM is (~10+2+2+3+1)¢ in quantity and will take 2-4 bits of bankswitching registers; the cheapest EEPROM solution I could find was (13+2+1+1)¢, I²C, 128b, and will take 2 bits out of the bankswitching register.
<br />
<br />Incidentally, Renesas now (still?) sells a 5V 128kB SRAM at $942/1000.

But given what I've seen in Shiru's init code and even some of my own code,* the problem with putting tiles and saves in the same bank of CHR RAM is the possibility of a bug in the VRAM loading routines causing loss of saves. One might solve that by using a 62256 and switching to the bank with the saves only when loading or saving, much like how SOROM and ETROM have a separate chip for the saves, or SXROM and EWROM have four banks.

<br />I have to agree with this. It's like saying "you can't jump in my game because my jump physics are crap". If there's a bug with your VRAM routines, fix them. The complexity and cost of adding another chip is hardly a good alternative to actually fixing bugs.

<br />I Disagree. The greatest failure is when you don't try at all.
<br />If you are bad programmer, just improve, lern new techniques, make some demos "for yourself only" and then try again. Just don't give up saying "I'm just born as bad programmer".
<br />Remember <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=8031" class="postlink">MOE?</a>.
<br />I spent about a year to improve my skill so(for example)map isn't read form $2007(MOE does that) for collision. I don't need to turn rendering off at bottom of screen to update on screen tiles(because of badly written NMI).
<br />ETC.
<br />By looking at MOE one might say. "Please DON'T make anything anymore, it'll suck anyway." But I improved, and in new game(currently waiting for Hardware tests) coding part is better.
<br />Even worst programmer can improve if he really wants it.

<br />
<br />I think it's worth noting that while SRAM standby power consumption is generally low, it does vary.  On the (admittidly, older) chips I've looked at previously, the part number will have an L for low power, and LL for extra low power (this is what you'd want for battery backup, ideally).  Throwing any random SRAM on there, the battery might not last as long as one would hope.  So, it's possible one would be paying a higher price for SRAM, if they wanted the longest battery life.

Fortunately they're the same cost ($112.90/100) but it is necessary to be careful and check.

"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," as Paul wrote in Romans 3:23. You and I both know this: as you pointed out to me later, you too have released imperfect software. And it's a lot harder to patch a cartridge after release than to patch, say, a downloadable Android game. On some platforms, even a downloadable game can run into problems, as Microsoft charges tens of thousands of dollars for certification of a patch to an Xbox Live Arcade game. (See the <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/story/12/07/20/1540247/microsoft-taking-heat-for-five-figure-xbox-360-patch-fee" class="postlink">recent Slashdot story about Fez</a>.)<br /><br />So the right thing is to do one's best not to be terrible, but also to take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of being unintentionally terrible. That's why I suggested using the extra banks in the RAM chip that one's already using to build in extra memory protection mechanisms as a layered defense. There are a lot of ways to do this, including some that involve no additional cost:<br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Renesas now (still?) sells a 5V 128kB SRAM at $942/1000.</div><br />If you have 16 banks available (128 KiB SRAM divided by 8 KiB visible to the PPU at once), and your game uses one or two, then why not store the saves in a bank that nothing else uses?<br /><br />Another mitigation is to have both password and battery save within the same game. For example, after completing a chapter, a game could give the player a password to restart the game from that chapter in case a freak glitch wipes out the player's saves, although with a somewhat underpowered party. It wouldn't be much different from the "<a href="http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Password#Bronze" class="postlink">bronze password</a>" in Golden Sun for Game Boy Advance that summarizes the stats of a completed game at a reduced level of detail so that the character could be imported to the sequel.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If there's a bug with your VRAM routines, fix them.</div>
<br />I agree that one should learn from one's mistakes. Jonah at first shied away from preaching in Nineveh but ended up learning from his sins and delivering a very powerful prophecy. Likewise, after having denied three times in one morning that he knew Jesus, Simon Peter became a strong advocate for the faith.
<br />
<br />But one still can't fix what's already shipped. Case in point: The original Super NES console, revision 1/1/1, has a defect that freezes the CPU if a DMA copy finishes too close to an HDMA. Nintendo fixed this for the more common 2/1/3, but games still had to work around the bug in 1/1/1 by not using DMA copy at the same time as HDMA. Likewise, after 3gengames reported Concentration Room's VRAM corruption bug to me, I isolated the problem and prepared a patch to fix the defect within the hour. But it still took years to discover this problem, as it had eluded me until long after I had already shipped Concentration Room 0.02 as part of the MGC 2011 multicart. Had I planned on battery-backed CHR RAM from the start of a project, I'd probably catch such an obviously reproducible bug quickly, but a similar bug that's <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/mandelbug.html" class="postlink">harder to trigger</a> might slip past the testers and end up in the shipped product. Furthermore, defensive programming techniques that allow programs to run correctly even in unanticipated environments are especially helpful when developing for a PC or an Android device.
<br />
<br />Besides, how would one test a game that uses this method? The only iNES mapper I know of that supports battery-backed CHR RAM (without NES 2.0 hackery that I don't believe anything really supports yet) is 168, used only for RacerMate Challenge, and that's marked "planned" on retrousb.com. That too uses two CHR RAM chips, only one of them battery-backed. Do any emulators support adding battery-backed CHR RAM to a more common board through the NES 2.0 header?
