For most controller read loops, the DPCM at is fastest will be dormant for at least 2 passes through the poll routine, but it might be able to corrupt a 3rd consecutive one. So the worst case is really six:<br />- correct, old<br />- corrupted, old<br />- correct, old<br />- correct, new<br />- corrupt, new<br />- correct, new<br />- correct, new<br /><br />Of course, you have to be lucky/unlucky to even get a conflict in the first place. It won't corrupt EVERY third loop, just ones where the $4016 read aligns with the DPCM read. I think it's normally like once per hundreds of frames. For it to happen twice consecutively would be exceedingly rare, and then on top of that you'd have to manage to press a button during, so... rare * rare * rare = has it ever happened ever?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">raydempsey wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Is there any risk that it could get caught in a loop that ends only at the start of the next Vblank or will it surely be resolved within a few small loops?</div><br />Not really. It's quite robust in any use I've seen. SMB3 seems pretty stable to me, I doubt the controller read loop ever caused a problem.<br /><br />Like, if you hooked a machine up to the controller port that changed the input on every strobe, it would hang the game in the controller loop, but this is kind of pathological. I don't think anyone would do that except if they were trying to build a turbo-button controller and didn't know that many games will read in a loop like this.

I have a TKROM 512 PRG 256 CHR flash cart WRAM w/ battery pack and I am attempting to use INL retro-prog v1.1 beta. Before I uploaded it, I trimmed a copy of my .nes file down so that the first 16 bytes went away causing the file to be 16 bytes shorter. Do I have to upload the PRG and CHR separately? I don't know if the file extension makes a difference but I tried uploading it when it was saved as both .nes and .bin but still no luck. No matter what I try to do, the program instantly crashes the moment I attempt to write to the cart.
