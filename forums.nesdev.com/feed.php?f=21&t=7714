Yeah, that looks awesome. I will mess with it, I need to add the palette back to green as the universal background color though, but that isn't that bad.

Remember your perspective.  You're not showing a straight top-down view, as evidenced by the stumps/logs (otherwise they'd just be perfect circles).<br /><br />Notice how other games like FF1 do their walls:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hteWT.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />You can see both the top and side of the horizontal walls.  I'd say likewise, your vertical fences are fine but the horizontal ones should show us a side view of the fence.  Also consider adding thickness like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EeWyz.jpg" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Fri May 06, 2011 11:48 am</p><hr />

I think you should stop trying to do too much with just a few tiles. You can't make anything convincing if you don't use different tiles for the different parts. You can't make a convincing slope with just one tile repeated over and over, you need more tiles for the left and right edges. The same goes for the water, you can't make a square lake and expect it to look good, you have to make a few rounded water/ground tiles and surround your lake with them.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri May 06, 2011 11:00 am</p><hr />

I was gonna say that this looked very pokemonish, especially the water.<br /><br />Okay, now to the critique.  Keep in mind I am often wrong, and sometimes it's better to do the opposite of what I say.<br /><br />I had no there were supposed to be slopes.  It looks like thinner grass maybe?  I don't think the thick plants looked like birds at all, but they did look like they were in a different perspective than the rest of the screen.  A little shadow around their base would've been nice to make it look a little more 3D.<br /><br />I think the water needs some sort of transition to it, like a slope downwards, even if it is only a slight slope, or otherwise it looks weird to me.  Also, I kinda like the old water better?<br /><br />You did a really good job of making it easy to read, especially with the few colors you used.

Sort of. Everyone has an idea of a game to bring to the NES, and mine is just an RPG, and I like the Pokemon style. I made these by look at the main pokemon screen and just trying each time after it. I hope the 8x8 tiles are big enough. I don't like the slopes either, but they work for now. I fixed the fences, and need to add the new palette for browns.<br /><br /><br />And I can't draw a straight line and have no artistic talent, so that'd be a huge mistake! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />Here's the water detail added back and some nicer looking "mosh grass", I cant find another way to make it look like a plant, but this makes it look more swampy so I guess I achieved something! And the grass that is just a checkered pattern will blend on a TV so that's my idea behind that. Now I have to make new lake water, since I also realized the graphics for the water seem more like a waterfall and not a lake, although the one to the right might suffice with the same graphics.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/8954/screenie20.png" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Wed May 04, 2011 8:35 am</p><hr />
