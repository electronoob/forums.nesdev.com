The audio circuits I install have you cut the traces to pins 45 and 46 and isolate them from the famicom pcb.

But that may not be cheap to do because converting slightly-too-fast 240p video to 480i properly requires a 2-frame buffer.

But objects can still move between the first field and the second field of a frame, showing motion with the same fluidity as 240p. Objects that move between fields simply appear less detailed while they are in motion, but no less detailed than they would have been at 240p. This can be seen in any live or videotaped television programming, which is presented at 60 unique fields per second, especially live sports. It can also be seen in games for sixth-generation (Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox) or later consoles and in PC games played through a PC to TV adapter.

I wonder how that would look? I don't think you need a buffer for a whole frame though, just a couple of scanlines.

Some GameCube games solve it by using a 3-tap deflicker filter, which mixes 1 part previous scanline, 2 parts current scanline, and 1 part next scanline. Should I run tests to show how hq2x + interlace + deflicker would look compared to 240p?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> I don't think you need a buffer for a whole frame though, just a couple of scanlines.</div><br />You'd need the buffer for the whole frame because during one frame, the NES outputs 524 lines while you need to output 525.
