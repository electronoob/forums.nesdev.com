I'm using a PIC18F usb part, it's about the same price as a FTDI chip, but gives me an active micro to work with, so I can do rate adaptation, etc..., and let both the NES and PC talk in a way they are comfortable with.  Microchip has example code for being a joystick, and for emulating a RS-232 link, and the parts have several endpoints, so I should (in theory) be able to merge the two together without too much trouble.<br /><br />The way I'm planning on doing comms should work perfectly on NES or SNES, regardless of whether the SNES is doing slow or fast cycles.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that most of the code is in C for either C18 or HiTech C, and I can't afford a license for either (~$400), so I've got to adapt the asm examples for the PIC16C USB parts.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sun Jul 24, 2005 3:09 pm</p><hr />

Sepi has been working on a controller playback device from the parallel port (tho without a real NES controller involved in the circuit, his test program just used the keyboard when I tried it).  Last I heard, it's improved a lot since the currently documented version with the addition of the reset signal to the NES.  I think that'd be more useful than NMI, since for the controller read syncing you can just watch the strobe/latch signal.  It would indeed be awesome to replay those 'tool-assisted' speedruns with something like that.<br /><br />How well does your USB interface work compared to the RS232 adapters I've made?  (I have tiny PCBs for them now too - they can receive MIDI also, tho that's untested).  Does the NES control the USB lines directly or is there a microcontroller in between?  FTDI chip or not?  Sorry for all the questions, heheh.  Either way sounds pretty cool.  If it can work syncronously then it would be good on SNES too (writing async controller timing code on SNES screws me up royally, the CPU changes speeds!).<br /><br />I was going to do RS232 through the controller port originally, I even found a source for NES cables (in fact, email me at gmail.com (memblers@) if you want, maybe we could both get some for cheap).<br /><br />Thread has gone way off-topic, but I'm not complaining, heheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Jul 23, 2005 8:37 pm</p><hr />

The controller port cable is totally seperate to the cartridge project, and the cart doesn't hook all of the address lines either, but the devkit does, although it doesn't intercept strobe, etc...  However, I haven't really looked into how the controller movies work.  If they only store records when the game strobes the controller, then it doesn't matter, but if they store say, key state per vblank, then it gets more complicated.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Jul 23, 2005 8:08 pm</p><hr />

Nope, just a slave connection, although I'm going to try to get it working as both a USB HID device (i.e. joystick for use on your computer, which will make it easier to sell the cable), and as a USB Serial profile (for transferring data, limited only by how fast I can grab it in 6502 code).  I haven't found a source for controller connectors yet though, so it'll be hardwired to a controller or built into a devkit for now (I didn't even order pcbs for it yet, but it's a simple point-to-point solder job).<br /><br />One thing I was thinking about was sticking on a SPI flash for recording and playing back controller input movies, but that really needs to be an in-console job, so I could hook /NMI for good sync <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Would people be interested in this?<br /><br />I *really* want to see the gradius 'speed'run on real hardware, mbwahahaha.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Jul 23, 2005 5:41 pm</p><hr />

Yah, I've got about a 3 mm seperation between the two designs, since I'll probably cut it with a bandsaw.<br /><br />Nope, different person.  My design includes everything it'll do in a single fusemap (all the discretes and mmc1), so it can be in-system-programmable using a controller-&gt;usb cable (I'll probably lock the final page of flash when the code is mostly stable so that users can't bork it).  I also started on a max 2 design (74xx, mmc1,2/4, native, and nsf done, haven't done mmc3 yet), that can do everything going except mmc5 (damn dual-port/dual-bus exram pretty much requires a fpga with block ram), but I wanted to do something simpler first.<br /><br />I'm using a EPM7064 for this design (got everything into a 7032 by squeezing very carefully, then I saw that the 7064 isn't much more expensive...)

Cool, yeah there is another PCB place called Gold Phoenix that seems popular.  I dunno if they do .047" boards though.<br /><br />I know I've asked Myro before about doing several boards on one setup, and they allow it (but naturally you have to always order the same amount of each).  I believe you'd send the design with both boards spaced 1mm apart.  If you heard about them from me, could you tell Robert I referred you?

In case anyone is interested:<br />So, my parts are on the way, and the PCBs are designed (I didn't leave a 2x3 strip to solder to after all, but soldering 6 air wires from the appropriate CIC holes to a chunk of card edge isn't much harder than soldering 6 jumpers from edge to edge).

sure I'm interested.<br /><br />I figured that the extra pins didn't matter one way or another, and must be internally tied low through a resistor or something (otherwise there's no way they'd leave them N/C on some carts).  I went ahead and wired them together, then through a smd pad just above the cic, so I could cut it or not depending on which donor cart the PCB went into.  Weirdly, on just about every board, some of the CIC lines (and on the MMC3 cart, a line from MMC3) went to the edge of the PCB and stopped, as if they were hooked up to test points on the portion of the board that got routed away, or something.<br /><br />Every MHROM board I've opened has been gloptop crap, which is a bummer since they're by far the cheapest donor carts you can get, I'm half tempted to take a bandsaw to the board around the CIC gloptops <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Wed Jul 20, 2005 5:18 pm</p><hr />

I only have pin 8 connected to gnd on my cart, and it seems OK.  I think it'd be really bad for them to change a chip pinout in a revision (just call it a new part # in that case, heheh).<br /><br />Looking at 3 MHROM boards I have here, as it turns out among them they have 6113, 6113A, and 6113B1.  And they do have all the unused pins on gnd,  so there ya go.<br /><br />I have an idea for an external lockout chip connector that I'll likely use in future designs.  That way one lockout chip could more easily work with multiple carts.  Let me know if you're interested in something like that.  It's only any good if more than one design uses it.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Jul 20, 2005 9:55 am</p><hr />
