		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, so, NES controllers (in addition to Genesis, Super NES, and a number of other systems) work by pressing a button which in turn completes the circuit for the respective button and causes the button press to be interpreted by the game console as "pressed".  Therefore, it is my theory that soldering directly to each side of the "teeth" on the circuit board and then attaching each side to a true arcade button to complete the circuit when pressed should work.  Has anyone done it this way before? I got the idea from the giant NES pad, only they soldered to a different part on the NES controller circuit board and I was wondering why they chose to do it on the backside rather than in the place each button occupies on the front.  If this would work for an NES, I figure it would also work for a Sega Genesis and Super NES as well.  I was even thinking of including a 3-position switch to go between each system and make it multi-platform.  Also, does anyone know if there are authentic arcade joysticks that only utilize digital presses rather than an analog signal? As in, switches for all cardinal directions that can also read diagonally.  I just want to make a simple project to occupy my time over the summer and I've always wanted a quality joystick to fill the void left by the NES Advantage with its creaky joystick and floppy buttons.  Also, if anyone has info on where to buy various arcade inputs like joysticks and buttons, etc. let me know as well.  Thanks.

(The NES and Super NES use virtually the same protocol.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, does anyone know if there are authentic arcade joysticks that only utilize digital presses rather than an analog signal?</div>
<br />Most arcade joysticks use digital presses. If you want one for the PC or PLAYSTATION 3, the regulars at tetrisconcept.com recommend the Virtua Stick High Grade. <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-zl-49-en-70-1rjw.html" class="postlink">Play-Asia sells them</a>.

<br />
<br />Most of the joysticks are digital, if it has 4 switches it should work (as long as it doesn't restrict where the stick can actually move).
<br />
<br />I don't know where the best parts are, but I'd recommend looking around on forums where people are building control panels for MAME.  There are different styles of buttons and joysticks.

<br />
<br />by teeth I mean the "E" shaped pieces interlocking where the buttons actually make contact with the board.  
<br />
<br />back to Tepples, Good to hear that works, I couldn't think of why it wouldn't, but I wasn't sure after seeing the Giant NES controller method.  To me, it seems easiest just to go to each button since there's really no need to conserve wire or space since its just one small chip in a big empty wooden box.  Don't arcade buttons have some industrial name as well?

<br />
<br />so...what is the technical name for the buttons though? I'm not sure whats the entire assembly and whats just a button or part of a button, etc.  I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to arcade terminology.  Also, what would you call a joystick with kind of an oval shaped top vs. the rounded ball type?
<br />

<br />
<br />like that
<br />
<br />and just to be clear, all these work like a lightswitch as far as circuits are concerned, right? just a simple connection when pressed in other words.
