If there are two possible sources of changes in reading (controller itself changing, DMC), then as many as four reads need to be made. If we throw in the microphone, I believe that the worst-case is 5 reads. But since we're now doing so many reads spread over time, the microphone could corrupt TWO of them (the first and fifth). So then the worst-case can be 6 reads, or more (I haven't seriously analyzed this).

So the bit read cannot change faster than 1ms no matter what causes it to change.

It could go just above the threshold, then just below it, and cause two changes within any amount of time. This is almost comical now; I don't see why having this work with the Famicom microphone is so important. What we really need is someone to run some test code on the Famicom with a mic and get actual behavior, though that still wouldn't tell us rare behavior. Maybe I should just ignore the subject further? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I find it's stupid to make code that is working on one type of machine but not another for stupid details like that. If you made code that runs on NTSC, then I'd assume it would run on all licenced NTSC NESes, NES2 and Famicoms in the world, not rely on unstable things. PAL only code can use tricks that don't work on the FC I guess, but I wouldn't made PAL only code myself.

<br />
<br />What's the average DC value on the microphone pin? If the mic output is zero-centered, then the digital input won't read true until it's loud enough (~1.3Vpp). (On the other hand, it could be biased to require less noise to trigger).
<br />
<br />Also, the schematic implies that the Famicom APU output also mixes back in, which worries me more.
<br />
<br />In other words, yes, it would be nice if someone with a Famicom would help.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got a Famicom and can run tests, but I don't know what specifically we're testing for. If you guys didn't know, there's a slide pot on the mic to control volume so that will surely affect the results. Because the mic is pretty sensitive, most Famicom players will have the mic always turned off so ambient noise doesn't overwhelm the game's sound, on my main system I have entirely disconnected player 2 for this reason. So I don't think dealing with the mic bit is a big deal, I'd just assume it's off.

<br />It's the other way arround : What is recoreded by the microphone is mixed with the output of the 2A03 sound.
<br />Also I'd bet the microphone is very cheap and low quality.

Run it on a Famicom and hold the B button on controller 2 the whole time (that's the one with the Mic, right?). Try making various sounds into the mic with various volume settings. If you're causing sufficient corruption, you'll see hex values printed, showing the worst-case number of good reads between two reads corrupted by the mic. Your goal is to get this as low as possible (unless you're already getting zero, in which case you have "won" already). Post some typical values, and lowest ones you got. Buildable ca65 source included.

<br />
<br />I noticed I wasn't initializing $4000 and was relying on the default initialization on the NES to 0. I added explicit initialization of $4000-$4002 to 0. I tested and it wouldn't have printed anything if the default initialization was wrong, so this probably wasn't the cause of your issue. Just fixing this on the slim chance it was the cause: <a href="http://h1.ripway.com/blargg/temp/fast_joy_famicom_test2.zip" class="postlink">fast_joy_famicom_test2.zip</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tried it again, made loud noises into the controller for a few minutes, only 3 times did it print non 00s spaced about 5 lines apart. The values were 78, 08, and 01.  The 78 happened when I made a loud sprinkler noise on about full volume, the other two were just random noise (everything sounds like noise through the mic) then after those three I couldn't get it to happen again after 15 lines so I gave up.
<br />
<br />I'll make a little test to just visualize the mic and see what happens.
<br />
<br />Edit: the test definitely confirms that my console is working. When the volume is off-1/2, it never turns on. It starts turning on around 2/3 volume if you're very loud, and at full volume when talking softly. At full volume just the noise of pressing buttons will be detected.
<br />
<br />Because the mic bit will go away with just a slide of the pot (and the game will be unbearable with the mic on picking up interference anyway) I still really don't think it'd be unreasonable to ask users of any homebrew to turn off their microphone (not that it will affect many reads anyway). There are probably some commercial FC games affected by this as well since I have a cart that suffers from DMC glitches nonstop! (how did that get by?) I say if you need the fast read routine, go for it, just maybe put a warning message to original Famicom users.

That means that the mic was corrupting two reads in a row during that half second of testing. You say after "15 lines", do you mean 15 lines of 00s? If you were getting 00 often while making noise into the mic, then it shows that this fast read routine cannot be used AT ALL on the Famicom with the mic enabled and DMC playing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, I assumed 00 was no bad reads. Yes there were 15 lines of 00s when I stopped testing earlier. When it starts (I'm holding B on P1), nothing prints unless I make noise, like it should, and when it does print (by having the mic turned on at all), it prints 00 the vast majority of the time regardless of volume. I also discovered how to get really high/bad readings all the time: there's a specific position on the volume where it's supposed to be off, but instead picks up exceptionally loud interference that oscillates the mic bit. So depending on how good the slider is, the mic may accidentally turn on during play... Fortunately it's very easy to distinguish when it's truly off.
<br />
<br />Maybe it'd be best to leave fast pad reading to a new hardware mapper.  It could also detect edges and probably DMC fortify in hardware.
