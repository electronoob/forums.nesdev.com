		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, i'm here with another newbie question!
<br />i'm making a repro (snes) for a friend. since he is going to leave town i can't fix it if something goes wrong... so, the question:
<br />if the eprom is not burned properly or the solder is not good in some point will the game works but stops at some point, like crashing while playing, reached a certain point of the game, or will i notice it as soon i try the game (ex: video garbage, game not starting, etc)?
<br />thanks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the EPROM had a writing error it may or may not be a serious problem. It all depends exactly white bit or bits are incorrect. The best thing to do is to verify the contents after writing them. Additionally verifying the cartridge by using a cartridge dumping device is a good idea. If you have a bad solder joint that would probably show up sooner rather than later. 
<br />
<br />Chances are if it works now it should probably be ok but anything could happen as we do not know the quality of your wiring and soldering.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />thanks for your reply.
<br />the eprom is burned ok, i checked:)
<br />i was just thinking about the wiring... so, the game can have troubles at some point of the game... there is no way to test it other than play it to the end, right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the game is running and you play into the first level or so, it's probably fine. ROM is randomly accessed in these games. Chances are relatively good that if any of the wiring was bad that the game would not run at all or crash very soon. 
<br />
<br />There is a chance that it could only show up later on, but it's less likely. Again if the game is working now and you give it a quick test, it's probably fine unless it gets damaged. So don't drop it or bang the cart against other surfaces.
