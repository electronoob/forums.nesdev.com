		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello !<br /><br />I guess some people here know the hockey-game Blades of Steel (Konami). If you don't, it's not important and you might still help us.<br /><br />For an artistic project of some person I know, he needs to have the puck graphic modified.<br /><br />We already tried to use classic softwares for sprite extractions ( Tile layer pro, tile molester), but, despite having spent hours trying and staring and enjoying a nice tapestry/world of 4-colors pixels, we haven't been able to spot it .<br /><br />It just doesn't seem to be there....<br />That puzzles me. I see no reason for the puck not to be in the sprites section of the rom. We can see and modify easily the letters, numbers.<br />It fits without trouble in a 8x8 square, it is heavily used during the game and moving around and interacting a lot with the game, IMHO it *must* be a sprite.<br /><br />My questions :<br /><br />* Am I wrong in my assumptions (I guess I am...), and more importantly why ?<br />* How could we spot it ?<br />* How could we modify it ?<br /><br />He is no nes hacker, and neither do I, but I may happily implement any solution involving programming (like a python script) in order to spot it out of the .nes rom . <br /><br />There are  some screenshots attached, two of the game,<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />According to <a href="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/profile.php?id=278" class="postlink">NesCartDB</a>, <em>Blades of Steel</em> uses CHR RAM. This means the ROM doesn't really have a &quot;sprite section&quot;; instead, the sprite graphics are copied from the main program section to video memory before being used. Some of the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CHR_ROM_vs._CHR_RAM#CHR_RAM" class="postlink">tricks that can be done with CHR RAM</a> include compression of tile data, which lets everything fit in the 1 Mbit ROM, and obfuscation of tile data, which makes it harder for Chinese and Russian pirates to rip evidence of their infringement out of the game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, it's a sprite but the graphics in BoS are RLE compressed. I happened to take a look at this game a year ago.<br /><br />You can use a Python tool from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thefox.aspekt.fi/graveduck.py">http://thefox.aspekt.fi/graveduck.py</a><!-- m --> to decompress the tiles. You'll then need to apply the modifications, compress the tiles again, and put them back into the ROM. (I have slightly modified the linked Python script to fix a couple of bugs in the original.)<br /><br />Since I was bored, I even took the time to find the file offset in which the gameplay sprites are, it's 49171. So you can use the following command to decompress the tiles:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">python graveduck.py -d &quot;Blades of Steel (U) &#91;!&#93;.nes&quot; 49171 bos.chr<br /></div>

Then used some educated guesses to find out where the compressed data begins.<br /><br />An even easier way (that requires 6502 asm knowledge, though) would probably be to set a breakpoint on reads from any compressed tile data, use that to locate the tile decompression routine, and set a breakpoint there. Then look at what parameters get passed to the routine.
