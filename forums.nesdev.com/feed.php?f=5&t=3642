I have two Genesis 2s, each with a completely different motherboard:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.rustedmagick.com/misc/gen2rev0.png" class="postlink">Revision 0?</a><br /><a href="http://www.rustedmagick.com/misc/gen2rev23.png" class="postlink">Revision 2.3?</a><br /><br />Notice the lack of a YM3438 on the first board. My guess is that it's integrated into one of the custom SEGA chips (the video chip, maybe?). Also, one of the boards has the distorted/overdriven sound problem, while the other has a nearly inaudible PSG, though I don't recall which is which.<br /><br />While we're on the topic of Genesis stuffs, I may as well ask: has anyone else hooked up a Genesis + 32X to an RGB monitor, and if so, did you experience weird crashes with any games? For some reason, I can't get Knuckles' Chaotix to run for more than a minute or so without crashing when it's connected to my arcade monitor, but as soon as I connect it to a standard TV, it works again...?

The Genesis 1 will not wholly fit onto the Sega CD 2 though without an additional piece of plastic. In the Japanese version of the Sega CD 2, this piece is included, I'm not sure about the US model. Another thing to consider is that if you're getting a used 32X, it's difficult to get the Genesis 1 patch cable.<br /><br />After the CD mechanism, probably the next likely cause of failure is the voltage regulator (from using an inappropriate power supply.) I've only bought one Sega CD 1 and one Sega CD 2 with a bad regulator though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Fri Oct 19, 2007 11:01 am</p><hr />

Like Tokumaru said the Sega CD 2 is far more common.<br /><br />Sega CD 1 is a front loading system (which at the time meant a mechanical CD tray), so naturally there's lots of moving parts to break. Generally a broken Sega CD 1 means a broken tray mechanism.<br /><br />I've bought many of both CD models from flea markets and from my experiences Sega CD 2 are at least twice as likely to work without needing any repair.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Oct 18, 2007 7:27 pm</p><hr />

I think <a href="http://www.rolentapress.com/rolenta/collection/sega/segacd2.jpg" class="postlink">this</a> combination is more common, because I have seen it many times, and have never seen <a href="http://www.rolentapress.com/rolenta/collection/sega/segacd.jpg" class="postlink">this</a> one. I'm not aware of any issues with the Sega CD 1, apart from the fact that it is a CD unit, and they all stop functioning at some point. Maybe more 1st gen models have problems because they are older.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Oct 18, 2007 7:01 pm</p><hr />

well, I've decided I don't care about the master system functionality since its basically like NES versus NOAC and there aren't really any master system games I want.  I didn't realize there were 2 versions of Sega CD, which one is more common?  What were the problems with the 1st gen Sega CD?
