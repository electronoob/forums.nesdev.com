The good news is that I have a plan on how to proceed, and that my routine to upload code to WRAM and execute it from there works fine so far. With Memblers' flash routines around, in theory the whole issue shouldn't involve more than compiling a ROM ... and some (or heaps of) trial and error.<br /><br />However. (What follows should answer your question too, keropi.)<br /><br />I haven't gotten the flash chip to &quot;respond&quot;, even after modifying the routine to fulfill the 29C010's datasheet specs, and with neither of the following two different approaches:<br /><br />1) Compile a standalone ROM and load it from CF like a normal game --&gt; no success (any writes to the specified addresses [whether they be converted to SNES LoROM addresses or not] just reach SDRAM, which the PowerPak maps to the A bus on game start, and reads simply return SDRAM content/open bus)<br /><br />2) Compile a special mapper file and load it while the flash boot ROM is active (and thusly mapped to the A bus) --&gt; no success (any writes to the specified addresses [whether they be converted to SNES LoROM addresses or not] are seemingly ignored, and reads simply return boot ROM content)<br /><br />So, either the flash ROM doesn't have its write signal line connected on revision D PowerPaks (very likely since the chip is socketed anyway), or ... I did something wrong. But without newbie-friendly documentation, hardware schematics, or even previous experience in flash programming, there's not much I can do, I'm afraid.<br /><br />For everyone without a PLCC32 programmer, there's still the option of asking RetroZone staff to reflash your PowerPak, and - provided they agree - sending it back their way:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">RetroZone wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The boot ROM is socketed for easy reflashing but this will hopefully never be needed. If it is needed and you do not have a programmer, you just pay the shipping to get your SNES PowerPak here and I will reflash then mail it back free.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=84" class="postlink">source</a></div><br /><br />So yeah: I'm sorry and really hate to admit it, but if you don't have a programmer (and a revD/revE PowerPak with socketed boot ROM), you're pretty much stuck with v1.0X as of now. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> Otherwise, you (carefully!) remove the ROM chip from its socket, reflash it with the BIN file from my release, reinsert it, and have fun. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Sorry again! And rest assured that I still haven't given up completely on getting a flash updater done. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Quotes I have been given would suggest probably £3 per chip + shipping and would be preflashed.
