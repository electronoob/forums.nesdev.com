What makes the C64's advantages over the NES more reminiscent of 16-bit platforms than the NES's advantages over the C64?</div><br />You have gone through every leaf on the trees and found them all to be 8bit leaves and to which you will say its doesn't look 16bit as all of it can be done on an 8-bit. yes this is true, as it was actually done on an C64. And you have valiantly defended the NES's honor ( not that it was being attacked ) by finding an instance of each of MIM leaves in some games on the NES, and then SMS when the NES didn't quite do it. However you have missed the forest, the point is all the leaves are in MIMs forest and 25 years ago when we played it on a CRT we all said &quot;Mate your pulling my chain, you put an A600 in the case didn't you...&quot;, it doesn't look 16 bit explicitly, it feels 16 bit, the high colour, the insane full screen scroller, the full music, the moving eyes on the trees, the way he accelerates, the way he launches of the top of slopes at full speed the way he looks down and worried when he gets to the end of the platform, the way his eyes go up and then down as he jumps, the way it has more than the fixed palette of 16 colours on screen, the smoothness of his jump, and his turn around. Since then it has been determined that it would actually be mostly possible on an A500 at EAB, but it would need some compromises, to be fair to the A500, less than the NES would need <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Its a lot harder for the NES to look 16bits due to 3 crippling factors. <br />1.) Teeny tiny VBlank update, its really hard to push enough data through to add more animation, change the background etc. To make this worse you can't even access VRAM but have to spend even more time sending data through a tiny pigeon hole. <br />2.) RAM, tiny amounts of RAM, which limits the amount the game can remember or the size of the world it can update. <br />3.) 64 sprite pixels per line, flicker is decidedly cheapening and a key thing of the SNES was it got rid of most of it ( unless you were Konami ) <br /><br />I'm not saying (and have never said) that no NES game can be so high polish and update the wold and avoid sprite flicker to make you think you are playing something that is 16bit. I don't know of any examples but I didn't really own a NES, my friends had it. I started at SNES. I would imagine the NES could make a pretty decent shoot-em-up that would rival some 16bit platforms.
