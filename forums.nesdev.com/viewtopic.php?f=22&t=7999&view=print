<br /><img src="http://shiru.untergrund.net/temp1/alter_ego_label.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br /><a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/files/nes/alter_ego.zip" class="postlink">Download the game</a> (392K) or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN-Z8S_MIH4" class="postlink">watch a video</a> (spoilers alert, it shows solution for few levels!).
<br />
<br />The game is a logic platformer. You control a hero and his alter ego. You have to switch between them to clear a level. It is a bit similar to Binary Land.
<br />
<br />This game is a port, or maybe a remake, of recent ZX Spectrum game of the same name. The original version created by Denis Grachev from <a href="http://www.retrosouls.net/" class="postlink">RetroSouls</a>, you can see video of it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSpHO4wAr_g" class="postlink">here</a> and get it <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0026211" class="postlink">here</a>. NES version got new graphics, original music by <a href="http://kulor.arnoldascher.com/" class="postlink">Kulor</a> (composed for the game), and some other changes.
<br />
<br />Interesting technical feature of this game is that it is written in C, with cc65 compiler. You can get source code <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/files/src/alter_ego_src.zip" class="postlink">here</a>. More details about this and development process in general are available in notes.txt file provided with the game.

I haven't made it too far yet (just to where the music changes), I have a feeling I'll have to use savestates or replay the first levels a bunch of times, heheh.
<br />
<br />Pretty interesting to see the source code in C too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Outstanding work! I love the polished feel your games have (right down to including a label and a manual). It's surprising how well the "drop every 6th frame" frame rate conversion works to unify the frame rate between NTSC/PAL.
<br />
<br />About notes.txt: "in case of the problems when C code does not work as expected, you need to figure out what to do by examining of the generated assembly code". That is true, but I'd like to remind everyone that NintendulatorDX (and NESICIDE, I think) can do source level debugging for C sources as well, which makes debugging somewhat easier. It's not yet perfect, because "Step" steps assembly instructions and not actual C code lines. Also C identifiers need to be prefixed with "_" in the watch window.

<br />Edit:  kulor and I both share the same complaint that the Level 2 song shouldn't have been cut.  It's very out of place to have a strange waltz song around a level filled with skulls and moss. xD
<br />
<br />Doesn't sound entirely finished, but at least it's in the FTM for me to enjoy.

Well, actually we agreed I'd fix the song as I like, but then Kulor rolled out second version, and I decided to just go with that. Besides of the second part, there were other problems with the first version, like DPCM attenuate of triangle channel which didn't worked properly at the time, and noise channel had to be changed, because it was too loud and introduced more 'detune' feel.
