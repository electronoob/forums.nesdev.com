<br />
<br />You may supply your own EPROMs, or you can buy them from me (my prices may be rough sometimes).
<br />
<br />I may lend out my own hacked carts if you send money or other collateral, if you don't want to take the time to modify a cart. (desoldering the old mask roms and rewiring it).
<br />
<br />Make sure you contact me before sending anything.
<br />
<br />You must pay postage both ways!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, but my main problem is personally not to burn Eproms, it's just to found NES cartidges. I don't know if anyone there has the same problem, but I've in head scince 9 months to burn a FF2 rom from a Legend of Zelda cartidge (Metroid or Kid Icarus would also works with few modifications). Thoose are the only 3 communs SNROM games released in PAL. I check for any cartidge of those 3 games scince a while, and I'm really unable to find any of theese. The only NES game I can still find are all NROM or TLROM (several SLROM and UNROM, too). Any other board is simply IMPOSSIBLE to find, at least in my country.

<br />
<br />You know, you can use NTSC carts, you just have to swap the lockout chip with a PAL one. Or, I believe you can just cut off pin 4 of the lockout chip inside the NES, I know it works for NTSC board, not certain of PAL, anyone?
<br />
<br />As far as I know, the MMC chips are all the same, regardless of territory.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Get them from ebay ? Well, it's easily said, but :
<br />1 - I'm not suscribed to ebay, and I can't suscribe because I've not yet any cash card (I'll probabily have one later when I'll be 18 years old or something, but for now...)
<br />2 - Shipping in Switzerland may cause problem for many products.
<br />3 - You have to suscribe in function of your country, and the page for Ebay Switzerland is in german, and I don't undersand german (I shall record to another country or ?)
<br />
<br />About making my NES universal : I ask myself if cutting pin 4 of the lockout chip on the card would work. So there would be both locks, and there is no reason to have it different that both keys (the locout chip doccument say it so, but i hasn't been confirmed). Also, I could lend my homebrow game to friends and so on, and they would work on their NES. Else, I could effectively replace them by an european lockout chip (by the way I ask myself if SNES lockout chips are compatible or not).
