So no risk/issue right now.   Only the ~15 are allowed to be sold as contributors.  So if someone decides not to follow the rules things can't get too far out of hand.  Canceling paypal transactions also reverses the fees, so I'm covered there.<br /><br />I'm also aware that there are a few groups/pairs of contributors that are in nearby enough demographics to where separate/double shipping may not be necessary.  For those of you to whom this may apply you can save on shipping and checkout with two carts, just put both names/games in the text field and I'll ensure all goes as planned.  This rule will not apply for general public sales, be ready to explain yourself if I see activity suspicious of multiple purchases by the same party.  Offenders will get no carts assuming all copies sell out rapidly.  Additionally, anyone caught reselling copies at high markup on ebay will be banned for future sales/releases/volumes.  Don't mean to be a jerk, just trying to keep things as fair as possible and keep us from getting taken advantage of.

I'm hoping we won't have issues, but I figured best to forewarn people to attempt to discourage any one with a scheme to make a few bucks off us.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> For those of you to whom this may apply you can save on shipping and checkout with two carts, just put both names/games in the text field</div><br />Unfortunately, I already checked out. What should I do to change my order so that I can get the cart for my cousin who made another game in the collection?</div><br />No worries, I can provide a partial refund to combine the shipping.  I'll PM you to discuss the details.<br /><br />If for any reason someone has issues in the heat of the moment with shipping charges or any errors on the pricing, try not to be too concerned.  Just get/checkout with the cart if you can and contact me about getting a partial refund.  It's a simple process from my end so don't be too concerned if the problem is resolvable by me sending a partial refund.  Once the carts are gone though, they're gone.  So if you try to contact me before checking out it may be too late by the time I'm able to respond.  We have the nice option of testing out the waters with the smaller group of contributors sales, so hopefully there won't be any hiccups come full release time.<br /><br />EDIT:  One after thought I had, if any contributors would like a link from my listing to their website, or change the name listed to their handle or something just send me a PM with what you'd like on your line and I'll make it happen.

I've already made a <a href="http://tasvideos.org/2326M.html" class="postlink">STREEMERZ &quot;Superb Joe&quot; TAS</a> and a <a href="http://tasvideos.org/2340M.html" class="postlink">Driar TAS</a>.<br /><br />The reason I write isn't to promote my TASes (so if I break any rules, please remove the links) but to say good job for porting STREEMERZ to NES and the developers of the games on this bundle (and everyone else who made this project become a thing)!<br /><br />I hope you will make more homebrews in the future when you are done with this project =)

I'm considering keeping the contributor's carts resevered for the first week.  There will most likely be more buzz about the release immediately afterwards which might be too late for all the contributors to catch wind.  I've been meaning to send PMs to all involved but haven't gotten around to it...  If there are any contributor carts left over after a week I could then list em to general public.

It's easier to plug the mouse that came with Mario Paint into a combination NES/Super NES clone console than to solder together an adapter out of extension cables as INL did. Does a mouse or trackball with the NES 7-pin connector even exist?<br /><br />If a large fraction of users will be using clones, developers who want to target those users need to test on clones. Thwaite, for example, has specific support for Dendy-style clones, on which it is supposed to PAL-correct the music tempo and game speed but not music or sound effect pitch. Unfortunately, it's only been tested in emulators because I haven't had a chance to test it on an actual Dendy.

The US top-loader re-release is by far my favorite system. But it's very expensive to purchase one compared to a clone. So when I had the option to buy an XBox 360 and a Yobo or just a top-loader, I chose the first option.<br /><br />Looking back on it, the top-loader may have been the smarter investment. I sold the XBox 360 about six months after I bought it, but I still play the Yobo <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
