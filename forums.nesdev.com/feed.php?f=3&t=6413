YOU GUYS ARE A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!<br /><br />IT'S WORKING!!!  Well, at least 100x better anyway.  There are still some very obvious bugs but I think my implementation of the mapper and mirroring is now correct.  I'm guessing that the remaining bugs are rooted at the most basic level of my PPU logic (which as I said before has known bugs).<br /><br />But WHO CARES!!  I'm running playable versions of Battletoads and Marble Madness on my emu!!!! KICK-ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Haha, and is it just me or is the segment starting at 1:34 of my new Battletoads video hilarious?! She is bouncing all over the place and to the beat of the music no less!  LOLOL.  If someone has any idea how the music could possibly be causing the screen to move up and down I'd love to hear from you.  In the previous test video the music was making the screen flicker on/off, but now it's moving up and down.  Haha.<br /><br />I seriously cannot thank you guys enough.  I am so excited about this!!! And if anyone sees any other obvious issues that they think they know the cause just lemme know!!! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Oh, and the new videos of both Battletoads and Marble Madness (which FYI I totally suck at) are on the site listed in my original posting.

Hmmm...ok.  Well, I'm pretty sure that I have the mapper implemented correctly.  I also implemented mappers 2 and 3 and the majority of those games all work perfectly.  I implemented mapper 7 in a similar way as mapper 2 with respect to PRG bank selection bits (except that mapper 7 doesn't have a fixed bank).  So I'm pretty confident that the PRG bank selection bits are in the correct position.  The one thing that is the big difference (well not that big) is being able to control the H/V mirroring bit.  Maybe I need to invert the polarity of the H/V mirror control bit from the mapper?  I was just using the same polarity as I had originally implemented for the fixed H/V mirror bit.  I'll invert the polarity and see what happens.  Worth a shot!! I will let you know if it fixes anything. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Thanks for the help guys!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3962">jwdonal</a> — Wed May 26, 2010 10:30 am</p><hr />
