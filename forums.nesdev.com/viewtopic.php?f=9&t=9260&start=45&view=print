		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As far as I know (and Nestopia's source loosely corroborates), only mappers 37 (SMB/Tetris/NWC) and 47 (SSVBall/NWC) use CIC RESET to reset a multicart. And the former, being Europe-only, I think wasn't even in a place with toploaders (No toploader was released in PAL regions, right?) Adding whatever simple circuit for this seems awkward for just one game (unless, of course, it's <em>your</em> console <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)

Interesting story about the super joy, I guess it shows that Nintendo really does still care enough to take action.  But it sounds like the super joy itself was the big fish worth frying, not that guy alone.<br /><br />Edit:  it might also be worth noting that Nintendo's financials have been on a downward trend since 2008 and they're bleeding pretty bad right now.  So I think it's safe to say they have bigger matters of concern than His NWC carts.  They don't put much of a dent on their 100's of millions of dollars in annual losses currently.  It may be a different story if Nintendo rebounds with the Wii U though and they're looking spend money in attempt to teach anti-pirating lessons...
