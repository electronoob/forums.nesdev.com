<br />I did little speedcoding with an emulator last saturday (first time since 2002 or so), and I'm wondering if this works correctly on the real thing too.
<br />So could someone with a PowerPak or some other dev system test it for me?
<br />
<br />It's just an little birthday greeting intro with some music from Little Nemo.

<br />
<br />Nestopia didn't like those NES 2.0 flags (it showed alert("Corrupt File!") and didsn't load anything), so I converted it back to iNES format by zeroing them out, and then I doubled the CHR ROM.  The garbage wasn't there in Nestopia.

<br />I didn't realize that char converter didn't create whole 8k bank as emu didn't complain. 
<br />And how silly of me to forget the proper initialization of nametables too.
<br />
<br />But I'm glad you spotted out those, as I was mainly wondering about the code running properly and if $0000 -&gt; $2006 at the end of NMI is enough to keep the screen at right position.

<br />That might be working, but the <em>correct</em> way to set the scroll is to write twice to $2005 to define the pixel offsets and once to $2000 to select the name table. Writes to $2006 alone don't fully reset the scroll, since they don't affect the fine X scroll.
<br />
<br />The only time $2006 is actually necessary for scrolling is when you need to modify the scroll when outside of VBank, something that happens when you enable rendering late (to gain more time for PPU transfers) or perform raster effects. If you are doing all PPU manipulations during VBlank (which is the norm), $2000 and $2005 should be used.
<br />
<br />And remember, tepples tested it on a PowerPak, which has a boot ROM that modifies the state of the machine before your program runs, so you must make sure everything is initialized properly even though it appears to work OK on hardware. For example, if you don't reset the fine X scroll the screen might get shifted up to 7 pixels to the right, but that won't happen on the PowerPak because its boot ROM did initialize the X scroll.

<br />
<br />I see. Thanks for pointing that out.
<br />
<br />So Loopy_T is undefined at power-up, but $2006 writes do initialize it to right value (Loopy_V gets initialized too), and hence the screen will be at right position. (not counting fine x scroll, which is probably 0 in emu's and initialized to 0 by powerpak).

<br />Yeah, this is most likely what happens. But you shouldn't really worry about things like loopy_t or loopy_v unless you are writing an emulator or doing scrolling tricks.

<br />But this was because i didn't write to $2000 again, and hence writes to $2006 trashed D11-D10 of Loopy_T.

<br />This will set the scroll correctly.

<br />You got the spirit. We at nesdev take more time to figure how the sytem works than actually develop games for it (as the result of the poor library of public domain NES games).

<br />Sure, wanting to understand things better is never a bad thing. If you feel like learning more about how scrolling works internally, go ahead.
<br />
<br />It's just that the way in which loopy's discoveries are presented ("the skinny on...") makes it seem like they are essential information for anyone wanting to code scrolling programs, when this is not the case. The only thing I have against it is that it causes newbies to get confused for nothing, because in 99% of the cases they don't even need that information in the first place.
<br />
<br />Even in your case, since you decided to use $2006 to reset the scroll you ended up neglecting the registers that were actually designed for this purpose ($2000 and $2005), and should be used under normal circumstances. Using $2006 to affect the scroll is a trick, that even a good deal of commercial programmers back in the NES era didn't know about.

<br />
<br />Maybe there's a need for a "simplified" explanation of what's in Loopy's doc, because I think it's absolutely necessary to explain why do you have to write registers in $2005 $2005 $2000 order. Maybe just something like "all those three writes must be done, and in this order, because PPU scrolling position will be trashed after $2006 writes". Then if that's not enough, coders could check out the Loopy's doc.

Nevertheless, scrolling with $2005 and even "tricky" $2006 midframe is really simpler than it sounds as long as you're not trying to do something mid-scanline or anything. If you want to deal with midframe scrolling changes, I tried to make a "simpler" explaination <a href="http://jonathan.microclub.ch/NES_raster/index.html" class="postlink">here</a> (along with a lot of other stuff), but I don't know how simpler it is in the eyes of a newbies.

You can scroll to any arbitrary fine X and Y value by using a 2006 write, two 2005 writes, and a 2006 write.  Only the first 2005 write and the last 2006 write will have visible effects, so try to make the last 2006 write happen before hblank ends.
<br />
<br />
<br />So to do a scroll to an arbitrary position during rendering...
<br />* Write anything with the correct name table bits to 2006.  All other bits are overwritten later.
<br />* Write the Y coordinate to 2005.  Three lowest bits of Coarse Y are overwritten later.
<br />* Write anything with the correct fine X to 2005.  All bits of Coarse X are overwritten later.
<br />* Write Coarse X (X &gt;&gt; 3) | Coarse Y (Y and #$38, &lt;&lt; 2) to 2006.
