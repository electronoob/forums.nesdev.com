In my view the primary purpose for mods being able to edit posts is so that they can delete things that should not be seen. (e.g. if *dragon were to post psychopathicteen's telephone number, or if someone posted an illegal ROM, etc.). Complete history wouldn't be desired in that case (which should be the only case, IMO, but I already went off at length on that in this thread).<br /><br />You can roll your own version of &quot;history&quot; where needed, though. In forums where I am a mod, I <em>always</em> leave a note in the edit explaining what I did and why, so that everybody knows why moderator action was taken, not just the poster.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sat Jul 09, 2016 6:37 pm</p><hr />

My opinion.

Why?<br /><br />a) a moderator/admin has authority for such corrections;<br />b) if the mod/admin is not violating the user's rights, there's no problem of doing it so;<br />c) the user must accept the rules - as editing is something that must be done in a few cases.<br /><br />If the user disagrees, it's easy - go away. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Sat Jun 04, 2016 8:14 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I have also gathered that different users may want to opt-in or opt-out to subject corrections, mark-up corrections, grammar corrections, dead link corrections, etc. What would be a good method of keeping track of this?<br /></div><br />I don't think you <em>should</em> try to keep track of this. These kinds of things shouldn't normally require moderator privilege to correct; just use the same methods that everybody else has at their disposal. (i.e. <em>ask</em>)<br /><br />Certain kinds of cleanup are good to perform, and sure, sometimes the author is not active, but you shouldn't be making significant modifications to historical posts either. If links have gone dead because a website has moved and the author is inactive, it seems sensible enough to provide revised links in an edit-- though personally I think you should leave the dead links in the post and provide the revisions in a clearly marked addendum. The dead link URLs might be important information. (e.g. a record of what the wrong link looked like can help identify similar dead links elsewhere)<br /><br />And I think that's basically the way I'd suggest doing any moderator edits to old threads; don't mess with the record. Only make <em>clearly marked additions</em>, not changes. Don't delete or replace things. This applies to spelling and grammar too; leave that stuff alone- it's relevant to the history of the conversation.<br /><br />If someone posts bad bbcode by accident, that would normally be spotted while the thread is still active; i don't see this being a siginificant issue with historical threads. If someone makes a mistake in an active thread and they've posted a 5000 pixel wide image, or caused it to spew HTML garbage by accident, etc. I don' think anyone would object to you making an edit to correct this, but it should be as small as possible to correct the mistake.<br /><br />Deleting or replacing should be reserved for intervention with bad behaviour / abuse, <em>not</em> for copy-editing. (Forum threads are not copy!!!)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />But derailment is a touchy subject encompassing posts by more than a single user, and I imagine that in most cases, not everybody whose posts could be affected by loss of context can be reached promptly through private message. So other than PMing each derailing user &quot;How does this post relate to this topic?&quot;, how should I handle it?<br /></div><br />Derailment happens naturally in all types of discussions, this is not special about internet forums. I would go so far as to say that it's <em>necessary</em> that it happens sometimes; a lot of digressions result in worthwhile exchanges. It's important that we be allowed to pursue this. It's not such an awful thing to have a plurality of topic in a thread.<br /><br />Yeah, people don't like it when they aren't interested in the digression, but that's okay. They can say so, too! Again I really want to encourage starting a new thread because of a digression instead of forcing it with a moderator action; <em>anybody can do it</em>, not just mods. I've seen you do it lots of times and I think it works well, without any of the context-destroying problems of a split.<br /><br />If you think someone is consistently or deliberately derailing things, or acting as a troll, tell them about it. Warn them. Ban them maybe if it's bad. I don't think anyone here is causing digressions that are worth a ban, but if you think they're being a problem you can tell them about it publicly or by PM. Splitting the thread instead of talking to them is only enabling/encouraging the bad behaviour.<br /><br />Same deal with editing someone's spelling. If you think it's important that someone spell things correctly, tell them about it. If you edit on their behalf, you're not helping them, you're just speaking for them. Telling them about it will correct <em>future</em> posts, same as how telling someone they're being too irrelevant will encourage them to behave better, if they care about your opinion.<br /><br />If they don't care about your opinion, moderating them is a hostile act anyway, so it's a losing situation from the start. I think most people here respond to others, though. We're a functioning community.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sun May 29, 2016 10:42 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I have gathered from previous posts that I have handled at least one derailment incorrectly in the past. Fortunately, in phpBB 3 (unlike phpBB 2), I can modify a previously performed split if it becomes apparent that the original split point was incorrect. So let me confirm that I have your order correct: Move <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=169647#p169647" class="postlink">your post</a> through Bregalad's, except for INL's, into the topic <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=14160" class="postlink">Freedom fries</a>, and revise your first moved post to reflect the split by linking to the previous topic, including a rename to &quot;Etymology of 'compo'&quot;. Am I right?<br /></div><br />Undoing an old split has all the same problems as splitting. Everything said after the split happened was in a different context, and you're mangling that <em>again</em> if you make a second change. (There's a saying about &quot;two wrongs&quot;...)<br /><br />Again, just like the original split, also confuses history for anybody with memory of the conversation who wants to go searching for it. Three parallel timelines of memory for the same thread. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I guess this means we're going to have to take time to discuss policy for how we will handle a topic whose author-provided title does not help readers find the topic and posts that derail a topic. Should each unuseful title or each split of a derailed topic be discussed publicly before action, such as a rename or a split, is taken? And if so, where?<br /></div><br />I don't really understand how this needs to be an administrative issue. Anybody can post &quot;would you consider revising your subject to ...&quot; in a thread. Same as anyone can post &quot;your code has a bug&quot; or &quot;you've made a mistake&quot; or &quot;I don't agree with you&quot;, or about any number of things that the author might consider revising. (Authors shouldn't edit their old posts in a way that destroys the historical record, either, but this can also be resolved through discussion in most cases.)<br /><br />Same deal with &quot;splits&quot;. Anybody can start a new thread, and post in the old thread &quot;hey, why don't we talk about this over <a href="http://link_to_new_thread/" class="postlink">here</a>&quot;. This is already a very viable solution, and it causes no disruption or revision of history/context. Using the split feature is the <em>nuclear option</em>.<br /><br />Every moderator intervention is an act of force, taking free will away from others to impose the will of the moderator. This difference between forcing someone to do as you say, rather than asking them is what makes it &quot;rude&quot;. And yes, sometimes it is much better to do this than allowing these freedom, which is why we need moderators.<br /><br />I just think the problem should be more significant than &quot;the thread looks a little ugly&quot; before you start using force.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Sat May 28, 2016 11:28 am</p><hr />

Am I right?<br /></div><br />Personally, I like the topic Freedom Fries. It wouldn't have been applicable to the first post about the word Compo, however I think it's perfect really for the overall direction of the conversation and the non-serious nature of it. I'd wanna leave the topic.<br /><br />All of this stuff is totally subjective and unless the person who started the split topic (if it can be narrowed to one person) says specifically how they'd want to handle it, there's almost no way of knowing what someone will consider the correct context for their words.<br /><br />If there are going to be thread splits (to avoid really weighing on that topic in this post) then I would personally think that doing them the way you're doing is almost the only option that allows for you to effectively make a timely thread split. If it's not timely, then I don't think a thread split does its job as a thread split. I'd think really, what we're doing right now is the only way to handle it. Do what you think is best, as a mod, and your discretion should usually be close to right. Then if somebody wants a correction, they'd have to say what they want or you're just taking shots in the dark.<br /><br />Also, I just want to add that this wasn't a big enough deal for me to say anything about it until thread splits became a topic of discussion, so I don't want anybody to think this is like a sore point or a serious issue from my end.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7129">darryl.revok</a> — Sat May 28, 2016 10:53 am</p><hr />
