<br />If you're wondering why the title screen has not appeared, it's because you haven't emulated the PPU's one byte read delay yet.
<br />
<br />This is how it should look:

After commenting it out and allowing all reads to 2007, it displays correctly.
<br />
<br />Should i be allowing reads to 2007 during rendering? What about writes?

<br />
<br />No - reads and writes should not be allowed <em>while rendering</em>, but remember that it is certainly possible to <em>turn off rendering</em> during scanlines 1-240 by clearing $2001.3 and $2001.4 - once you do this, you can mess with $2007 at any point during the frame.

<br />
<br />A programmer can read from $2007 any time they like, even if it's during refresh. I know that this will mess the screen up, but it's not like reading or writing to $2007 is banned or anything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />$2007 reads/writes during rendering are possible, tough they ARE banned. Writes to $2007 causes the $2006 pointer to increase, meaning that the the PPU scrolling will go mad until it's set to a proper value again (and the write will have no effect of course), and I have no idea what a $2007 read can do, but most probably it reads some unpredictable stuff and make the scrolling go mad.

<br />Nope, Quietust and me just said that $2007 writes and reads during rendering are worthless and will just scew up the screen, so no reads/writes should be "allowed". That don't mean they cannot happen, unlike what you seem to understand.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think WedNESday's point is that the NES hardware has no way of banning a program from doing things; if the CPU reads from address $XXXX, it <em>will</em> read from that address no matter what. The only question is what happens when the CPU reads. "Banned", "disallowed", "illegal", "invalid", etc. are descriptive of human activities, but there's usually never a human around to police what a NES program does. The only things a NES program can't do are those that are logically impossible, like reading from address $10000.
