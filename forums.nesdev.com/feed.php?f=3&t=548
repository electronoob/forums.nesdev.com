??? blargg???<br /><br />I asked you a question about NEStress and instead you have posted nothing but a complete bunch of garbage!!!<br /><br />Please lets stick the matter in hand. Please could someone explain to me what it meant by:<br /><br />1. PPU First Read Correct;<br /><br />This tests the PPU read "pipe" to see if the first read is just random or the actual value in the "pipe".<br /><br /><br />Does pipe refer to whatever is stored at (CPU Memory) $2007?<br /><br /><br />2. Mixed Address/Data Write;<br /><br />This tests that the PPU address isn't changed before both bytes are written to the address register.<br /><br /><br />I appear to emulate this but I still get that error message.<br /><br /><br />3. Use $2002/$2005 to set Address;<br /><br />No explanation given.<br /><br /><br />How is it possible to use $2002/$2005 to set the PPU's 16bit address?<br /><br /><br />4. Palette Write/Read;<br /><br />No explanation given.<br /><br /><br />What does this refer to? NO emulator I know seems to support it.<br /><br /><br />I have read the documents that were recommended to me but they haven't solved my problems. Also, does any of the above require precise timing?<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sun Sep 11, 2005 3:27 am</p><hr />

I found some of NEStress's descriptions a little hard to figure out, so I examined the asm source for some of the tests.<br /><br />A little meta-explanation... When describing something to someone, there are two main contexts you can use: yours or theirs. Using your context involves describing your model (terminology) and then using it. Using their context involves first examining their question and figuring out their current mental model, <em>then</em> describing things within that model.<br /><br />Using the other person's model is more time-consuming, but it is much more effective because you are in the position of understanding the material, so can easily alter your explanation of it to fit other people's models. Of course sometimes a person's model needs repair before anything new can be explained.<br /><br />Summed up, a person's question is the perfect context to answer it concisely and in a way that is understood easily, though sometimes only a long answer will do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Sep 10, 2005 3:39 pm</p><hr />

You should read first "2C02" reference, and loopy doc too (altought is some cripting).<br /><br />what i advice you:<br /><br />Read:<br /><br />- NesTech.txt complety (altought is old and not actulized) to build a good base.<br />- NinTech wich is newer.<br />- 20C2 reference.<br /><br />If you understand what it says there you will understand what you were asking. <br />It is not so simple to explain those things if you dont have a previous knowladge on ppu addressing and those things.<br /><br />Regards.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Sep 10, 2005 2:50 pm</p><hr />
