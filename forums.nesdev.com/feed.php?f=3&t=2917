Actually, I like it, to some extent. It really does look authentic. But, you know, I prefer RGB for every console from the SMS onwards. I would say ESPECIALLY the SMS, since there's rainbowing and chroma artifacts everywhere. Actually, I'd like to see it in more emulators, especially ones of YUV-only machines (The VCS and C64 come to mind).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1345">CartCollector</a> — Fri Mar 30, 2007 6:34 pm</p><hr />

No, I did not mean anything against your filter, on the other side, it really rocks all the way, and I like using it pretty much. What is great is that you can "attenuate" the things, and it really looks like original once the frame merging is enabled (however I think it really looks horrible with frame merging disabled, but that's not an issue because you can just enable it).<br />However, it's just a different philosophy over a filter such as 2xSal : NTSC filters goals to have the image look like it does on a TV, while 2xSal try to stretch the image wile keeping nice and round graphics. I think both rocks, and it's a very good thing you can choose between both when you want to play a game, and that is what makes emulation a good thing.<br /><br />It's just like the 8-sprite limitation, you can just enable it and make sure your emulators emulate accurately your NES by keeping it's original look (and maybe some games would actually rely on it), or turn it off and take the advantage to play games with enhanced graphics with all anoying flickering almost removed, but some games will look weird with that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Feb 04, 2007 12:43 pm</p><hr />

The only objective measure of NES emulation is how close it is to a NES connected to a late 1980s/early 1990s TV. Enhancements are subjective, and people differ on which ones they like/dislike. There's also no end to how much time you can spend enhancing something, since it's just another word for making changes that are subjectively pleasing or helpful.<br /><br />My main goal with the NTSC filter is approximating the image on a TV. For people who desire the original look, it's the best we've got short of using a TV. For people who don't like that, I provide many adjustments to reduce some of the composite effects, like pixel artifacts, blurring, fringing, and color bleed (which is the most helpful thing to leave enabled, in my opinion). Still, I don't pretend that it's superior to any other filter as far as how pleasing it looks, so I don't mind what filter someone uses most.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sun Feb 04, 2007 11:52 am</p><hr />

While the NTSC composite emulation rocks all the way, I still think the 2xSal filter looks better with most games, even if it looks totally different from the real thing (and the goal of emulator isn't restricted to look exactly like the real thing).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Feb 04, 2007 3:07 am</p><hr />

Note: Those who don't know how NTSC or PAL work might not understand what I'm talking about. The rest of you, read on.<br /><br />You know how on a TV displaying a composite signal, if there's a thin vertical stripey patten you get a rainbow? That's because the signal being displayed exceeds the bandwidth of the connection, trying to do more color shifts than are possible. So I was thinking, "Why not have this emulated?" You could have it so that you could set the bandwidth of the virtual TV (IMO it should start at around 210) to see what it would look like. Then you'd have to emulate the color carrier and luma level for each pixel, along with a delay each time a color shift took place. Then the virtual TV would take a "snapshot" of the current phase and voltage, convert it into RGB, and voila! Composite emulation. <br /><br />Not very helpful for those trying to escape the nastiness of composite through emulation, but helpful for homebrew authors trying to see what their graphics would look like on a TV. I imagine it could be used to create title screens/cutscenes with more colors than the NES could normally display, sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter" class="postlink">like this</a> (scroll down to "Composite video display"). It would also be nice if there was an emulator that could emulate interlaced video, but that's been discussed already.<br /><br />I don't know C++ that well, so what does everyone else here think?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1345">CartCollector</a> — Tue Jan 30, 2007 6:54 pm</p><hr />
