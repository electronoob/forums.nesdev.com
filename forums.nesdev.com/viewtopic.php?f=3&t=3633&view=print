		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi there
<br /> 
<br />I have a MAYA DVD-402 DVD player with a so called "game function" which emulates the NES. However, the emulation sucks, the games run at 1/4 speed and the sound is terrible (i have to play it on mute).
<br /> 
<br />It came with a mini VCD with around 300 games on it (around 100 if you discount doubles). I would like to play these games on my PC with the nestopia emulator however it will not recognise the roms. The roms have a .bin extension where normal roms are .nes. I have tried renaming them to .nes but still no luck.
<br /> 
<br />I have been talking with the Digitalpress forum guys and one of them suggested I contact you guys to make heads or tails of these files. They are definitely nes games, but with a different file structure.
<br /> 
<br />I would like to play them on PC since the DVD player stinks, if you guys are interested in the roms to look at I could send some to you through email. Some look like hacks, others originals. 
<br /> 
<br />If you would like to help, please respond and I will send you some of the roms.
<br /> 
<br />Thanks
<br />Sam

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was always curious to see how the ROMs that these devices used were stored. I almost bought one just to see what the deal was, but then someone told me how bad the emulation was.
<br />
<br />I don't know if all that's missing is a header... This player must have a way to identify some details about the game in order to run it correctly, which is exactly what a header does. Maybe these ROM have a different type of header?
<br />
<br />But yeah, it will be hard to say anything for sure without looking at a ROM, preferably one af a well known game. What are the sizes of these ROMs? I mean, the size in bytes (not KB). This information may at least tell us if there's any kind of extra information or not.

<br />I have inspected those awhile back.  It's an emulator stub with the ROM attached to the end.  Sometimes you can extract the ROM which is on the end, sometimes it's hacked a bit.  After figuring out what most of the games were (mostly NROM stuff) I lost interest.

I don't think the offer to e-mail them is good for this place either. If you'd like help decoding them, you could post a hex dump of the first 32 bytes or so. My guess is that the player has a hard-coded database of configuratin information for each one.

I guess if all games are NROM there is no reason to have a header (or even if there is only NROM, CNROM and UNROM or something) since the size alone can tell enough information to run the game.
