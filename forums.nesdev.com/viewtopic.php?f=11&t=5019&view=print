Let's see, uh, Koko ni nihongo de kiku koto ga dekimasu. I think I said what I meant to say  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> . But not very many people speak Japanese here. I'm studying, and have to google over half of the kanji I see. Quietust, who used to be one of the most active users here, and a moderator, was quite fluent in Japanese and often got on my case for attempting to speak it when I couldn't <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> . But he's been gone for a few years now... I guess if you wanted to ask stuff in Japanese, you could and a few of the users here (Banshaku for example, who I believe lives in Japan) would be able to answer your questions. I'd try and understand what was written and formulate a decent response, and it would be good exercise for me, but then you might as well be speaking English!

I ended once on a BBS that was talking about nes programming but never took the time to read in depth.  If I find back the link, I will let you know but I don't think it was something similar to nesdev.

I just thought it would be cool if there was a forum full of Japanese homebrew FC developers somewhere.  Then I could go there and practice Japanese and NESDev at the same time.   It would be like combining two hobbies into one.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  My Japanese reading is at a level now to where I think I could hang.

<br />I found something interesting but not related to bbs <a href="http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/special/20080922/1018969" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br />
<br />I didn't have time to read it yet (since my kanji level suck) but there's some story about the days of the famicom when it started, programming etc. There's even some <a href="http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/special/20081002/1019327/?SS=expand-digital&amp;FD=1136892796" class="postlink">prototype image</a> of the famicom that I never seen before too. Will try to read it soon.

I'm not sure if it's the same or better than other translation software, but can understand 99% of anything with it.
<br />
<br />If there are any active development forums in Japan, I'd hope they'd be aware of this place and know that they're welcome to join in.  I always read the posts here using translation software.

<br />Good to see that this article that I found by accident was worth it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Now this morning I just realized that one of the site I found yesterday by searching ファミコン開発(famicom kaihatsu -&gt; famicom development) is maybe the Pasofami author site and he's still selling it (1700 yen). A new version seems to have came out in 2009.  I need to confirm it to make sure it's really the original author.
<br />
<br />I will continue to search for japanese site and post some results here.  Maybe I should get in touch with a few of them.  No luck for any community with the search query ファミコン開発コミュニティ yet.

This is a good question.  <br /><br />My guess I would search for anything that would be a bulletin board (掲示板） but for now I only found pages from users that have tutorial that were not updated in years. One looked like a translation of patater tutorial ^^;; Another site was last updated in 2007 and still have links to parodius so for now.. A quick search doesn't find anything new.<br /><br />There is good chances that nesdev is the bbs that still have a lot of activity everyday about nes programming.
