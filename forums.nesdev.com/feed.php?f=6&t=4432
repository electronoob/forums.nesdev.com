Yeah, but is the right tuning the exponential or just one ? Gyaaah what a headache. Anyway because of how roughly rounded the NES's freq registers are it probably makes no difference.<br /><br />I don't undestand the method you describe.

Well, I already knew about formulas and all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Roth, I'm also a musician and fascinated by the math aspect of music.<br /></div><br />Same on me.<br />Roth, the frequency of notes are based on a exponential base 2 function. If you don't know what this is you should get some basic math courses.<br />A minor quint is exacly a square root of two (1,414...) and I don't think this is a horrible ratio, it is present about everywhere in geometry (so in real life).<br />A 4th is 2^(5/12) which is almost 1/3 (but not mathematically equal to 1/3 !!) and a 5th is 2^(7/12) which is almost 1/2 (but again not mathematically equal to 1/2). It's true that this is fun facts. Organs (both accoustic and electric) allow the player to select such rational frequencies to be output, which are very close to actrual note intervals.<br /><br />A minor quint can sound very good or very bad in some piece of music. After all music is a subtle arrangement of consonances and disonances. With only consonant sound it would be flat and boring.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />440 KHz? My cat can't even hear that. A mechanical vibration at that frequency would attenuate in air in probably less than a few millimeters anyway!<br /></div><br />Yeah the other day a guy told me he could hear songs up to 20MHz and that makes me laugh (I guess he mean 20kHz wihout noting his error).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />EDIT: Also, the piano starts with an A as the bottom key.

However my electronic keyboard both starts and stops with the C key (which is usefull to play DW1 map music on the highest octave).<br /><br />Tepples : I don't want my format to ressample MIDI or anything. I only use MIDI for prototyping the track, before converting them. My pitches are stored on 4-bits in fact and I place octave switch commands when I have to (notes "12-15" are reserved for commands).<br />It's good to know the GB can't reach the bottom A. I don't know if I will ever write a music engine for it, but if I do it would be good if I can make it like it's NES counterpart. Also I guess it applies to GBA too since it shares some sound channels.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Oct 06, 2008 9:51 am</p><hr />

Roth, I'm also a musician and fascinated by the math aspect of music.<br /><br />Stepping up an octave means doubling the sound wave's frequency:<br /><br />A = 220Hz<br />a = 440Hz<br /><br />In "normal" music (12edo as tepples referred to), there are twelve steps between those A:s, each step of equal size (one fret on your bass)<br />That step is ~1.06, so that<br /><br />A  = 220<br />A# = 220 * 1.06<br />B  = 220 * 1.06 * 1.06<br />C  = 220 * 1.06 * 1.06 * 1.06<br />etc<br /><br />and when you get to the next a, all those 1.06 times each other add up to 2 so that<br /><br />a = 220 * 2 = 440 Hz<br /><br /><br /><br />Now what's fascinating is that commonly used intervals such as A-E (a "power chord") actually make sense mathematically because<br /><br />A = 220<br />E = 220 * 1.06 * 1.06 * ....  = 220 * ~1.5 = ~330<br /><br />so the ratio in a quint is a fairly even number, 2:3 (1.5), whereas a minor quint is something awkward like 1.42 which is why it sounds horrible.<br />The fire dept here in Sweden uses a minor quint to attract attention. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12">Nessie</a> — Sun Oct 05, 2008 3:07 pm</p><hr />

Not to derail your thread, my good man Bregalad, but:<br /><br />Man, I think this must be the reason I haven't been able to write a music engine. I can't even put together what you guys are talking about! I mean, I play music, I know theory (which is a must for a free jammin' bass player), I know my way around music. But I just can't get this... I don't know what it is... math aspect (?) of it in my head. This kind of talk really gets to me, because it seems like maybe it's a wave pattern thing that I should think in terms of??? I don't know.<br /><br />If anyone has any insight into what approach I should take, please PM me.

It would seem that C is the "first note".<br /></div><br />"Equal temperament", or 12edo (twelve equal divisions of octave), is a musical tuning system whose pitches are exactly one semitone apart. "Semitones" are twelfths of an octave, a pitch ratio of 2^(1/12) = 1.059463:1. A cent is a hundredth of that, and musical tunings are often given in cents.<br /><br />MIDI numbers all semitones such that middle C is 60 and A440 is 69. All multiples of 12 are C:s, which makes a strong case for C being the MIDI scale's base.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />However, A is the only note which has a rational frequency (440Hz, other notes have irrational frequencies calculated from the mid-A pitch).<br /></div><br />Equal temperament uses irrational frequencies because they sound equally bad in all keys. Various forms of "just tuning" use all rational frequencies, which works in some keys but fails in others unless the instrument is retuned. But humans generally can't hear pitch differences below 0.06%, or five cents. Some of my software tunes middle C to exactly 2093/8 = 261.625 Hz, which is 0.003 cents off the exact value of 440/2^(9/12) = 261.6255653 Hz, and I'm pretty darn sure nobody gives a care.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />And the lower available note the NES' APU channels can play is A (okay, PAL NESes can reach Ab, but why would you compose music that only works with PAL ?).<br /></div><br />Game Boy can't go below 64 Hz, where C is 65.4 Hz and the B below that is 61.7 Hz.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'd just have to change octave shifts in my data, wich is quickly done.<br />Any ideas?<br /></div><br />For songs composed in 12edo, I can see only one benefit of not just using MIDI semitone numbers, and that would be if you try to pack a pitch into 6 bits. In that case, you might have to encode pitches as MIDI-minus-33 (low A at bottom) or MIDI-minus-36 (low C at bottom). If you're trying to make one format that works across NES and Game Boy, you might choose the latter.<br /><br />NT2's frequency table includes 96 entries, corresponding to MIDI note numbers 24 to 119. The lowest nine entries get played incorrectly on an NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Oct 05, 2008 1:32 pm</p><hr />

Everything is in the title. I have always implemented music engines where the note N°0 is C, etc up to note N°11 which is B. It would seem that C is the "first note".<br />However, A is the only note which has a rational frequency (440Hz, other notes have irrational frequencies calculated from the mid-A pitch).<br />And the lower available note the NES' APU channels can play is A (okay, PAL NESes can reach Ab, but why would you compose music that only works with PAL ?).<br />Also, the fact that the first letter, A, is agigned to A and not C probably have historically something about A being the "first note" of the scale.<br /><br />For these reasons, I'm considering switching to a system where note N°0 would be A, and note N°11 would be Ab/G#.<br /><br />I'd just have to change octave shifts in my data, wich is quickly done.<br />Any ideas?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Oct 05, 2008 12:59 pm</p><hr />
