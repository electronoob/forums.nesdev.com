		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Got er!  It ended up being pretty simple.  Python doesn't automatically set up an Path environment variable when it's installed on Windows, so I did that myself in the Advanced System Settings under System.<br /><br />I also had an issue with directory/executable naming for no$sns.  I left the executable named that when it unzipped, and unzipped everything for no$sns into a directory called no$sns months ago when I started playing around with it.  The Make script didn't like the $ character, so I just renamed the directory and executable and all was well.<br /><br />The ROM has compiled and is now up and running fine.  Thanks for taking the time to make and share this Tepples.  I've been off and on experimenting with SNES for a few months now and a nice beginner example like this will be very fun/helpful to dig into.

This is alright for if you made it and know where everything is, but if other people are looking at it, you might want to have things like the init code separate. You might want to look at Walker on the SNES starterkit. Its very organized and understandable, in my opinion.

Walker kind of does this, but not quite as bad. I just think the main problem is that it is not a very clear where something ends and something starts. If you want to split the file, you could have all BG mode and BG tile stuff in a different file from the part where the controllers are read to make the character move, so it is a little more clear as to what is going on.<br /><br />I might try to help you a bit on this latter, (I don't really want to use wla in its current buggy state, but I am.) but for now, you might just want to take a look at walker in the SNES starterkit.

What I have been working on since last night is converting your code to use ca65 (including all necessary .exes, an updated .bat, etc.).  I've done most of the work at this point, but as you can see from the other thread, I'm obviously running into problems with ca65 which are certainly user error on my part, and I cannot progress further until I can talk to someone who actually has very in-depth familiarity with ca65.

Anyways, I do the same thing quite often, and it's to help with code clarity and maintainability.<br /><br />Looks like there's a bug in that piece of code. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">beq doneWallCollision</tt> never jumps since A was loaded with 28, but the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">bcc notHitRight</tt> below it ends up picking up the slack. On top of that, I think it's a good practice to add a comment when you're purposefully using a conditional branch instruction for an unconditional branch, e.g. something like:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">bne doneWallCollision ; jumps always<br /></div><br /><br />...or just use BRA since we're on 65816 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for taking the time to look at my code. Sometimes it's like pulling teeth to get a code review. Please bear with me while I try to understand the importance of each issue you uncovered.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Walker looks a lot more organized because it has huge barricades like this to separate different parts of the code. (The parts you jmp and jsr to.)</div><br />Ideally, that's what <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.proc</tt> is for. But if <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.proc</tt> isn't noticeable in the default settings of other users' existing favorite text editors, then I might need to put doc comments on all subroutines, even subroutines whose behavior is evident from the name and which takes no arguments. Here's what a doc comment from ppuclear.s looks like:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">;;<br />; Clears a nametable (2048 bytes) to a constant value.<br />; @param X starting address of nametable in VRAM (16-bit)<br />; @param Y value to write (16-bit)<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, you need to change stuff like this:</div><br />My coding convention often includes a blank line <em>after</em> a &quot;skip forward&quot; type label, roughly corresponding to the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">End If</tt> of an <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">If ...

You are correct that I was missing a blank line.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Why in the world do you even have two different places you can jump to if there's not a single thing in between them?</div><br />Because the jumps are for different reasons, one for not having hit the right side wall, and one for being completely done with collision checks for this frame. It helps with inserting additional checks at the right place should they become needed.<br /><br />And yes, I discovered the same bug that thefox mentioned (a never taken branch that was intended to be always taken), but my laptop's 2 1/2-year-old battery immediately dropped from 35% to like 8% before I could finish this post about having done so. I had changed a <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">lda #$00 sta</tt> to <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">stz</tt> because hey, 65816, but I forgot to change the following branch.

You don't have to put <strong>everything</strong> in a separate file, but maybe try taking the largest subroutine (Isn't it move_player?) and putting it by itself. It's also usually nice to have graphics have a separate file, because otherwise, you'll end up with a <strong>huge</strong> main file.
