<br />
<br />This one I would suggest being UNROM based, probably a 2 in 1. Particularly since its not having much traces going on the cut off side and I'm sure one extra chip used to live up there

<br />Haha trust me, look at Farid's other post and you'll soon find out that this guy won't quit and will probably manage to dump it by himself even if it mean trying every possible combination of pin-out, address line by address line on his eprom reader:D I think this guy was never thought how to quit <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I have a hard time believing this thing was somewhat formally produced with the top half of the board cut off.  Not to mention it doesn't seem to fit the profile of other mappers.
<br />
<br />It could have even been someone who had no idea what they were doing trying to use a multicart board as a donor for a UNROM game.  I know it doesn't make sense but to someone who has no idea what they're doing it could.
