Long time, no speak.  I played Celceta at E3 this year.  It was pretty sweet.  I might have to buy a Vita for that one.  Anyway, if you're still hanging around Chicago we should meet up and chat about console video mods.<br /><br />I don't want to hijack anything here, but once in a while I do Google searches on &quot;SNES component cable&quot;.  Since I support the <a href="http://www.vghmuseum.org/" class="postlink">Video Game History</a> museum, one can see how I cringe everytime a system is modded for no reason.  I decided to actually respond this time since I do have an account here.  I know this is a forum of mostly technical people, but would people be interested in mod-less SNES component cables?  In addition, I would guarantee that this solution would have higher picture quality than any mods found out there.  Here's a <a href="http://www.hdretrovision.com/SNES_prototype.png" class="postlink">photo of an actual working prototype</a> that I completed this past February.  Please forgive the poor gluing job.  I don't know what it is about me, but I always manage to get glue everywhere including most of my fingers.  ANYWAY, this cable is completely plug-n-play, so no modding (provided you have an SNS-001) and no external power required.  I'm trying to go into production on these, but that could be a ways off since I'm creating cables for other systems too.  Right now I'm working on building a website instead of the placeholder I currently have.  Just yesterday, I finished recording a side-by-side composite/component comparison video for Sega Genesis.  I'll do a SNES one in the coming weeks and it'll be a 3-screener comparing composite, s-video, and component.  Bah, this post is getting too long.  Sorry.  Bottom-line:  You don't have to mod your SNES to get high quality component video output.<br /><br />If you're more interested in mods, hear what NightWolve has to say.  He's a good guy and knows what he's doing.</div><br /><br />I would love schematics for this, or something that can be purchased without throwing away lots of money. I would be very happy to have something like this available. <br /><br /><br />Maybe you could explain in further detail how this works.</div>

It's an analog R'G'B' to Y'PbPr converter that I spent almost two years optimizing for size, cost, power consumption, and quality.  The circuitry fits completely inside an aftermarket SNES A/V connector.  The end user doesn't even need to be aware that there is a circuit there.  I guess, in at least one way, it's similar to the Gamecube Y'PbPr cable.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikejmoffitt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I would love schematics for this, or something that can be purchased without throwing away lots of money.

What do you believe is a fair price for such a cable?<br /><br /><br />I attached some test screenshots I recorded a week ago.

I have already laid out my issued before and in all honesty...I am still going to get a Retron5 when it comes out.  The reason being is because my Componet to HDMI through receiver to projector gets distorted and I have to run a Componet cable to my projector for it to correctly display.<br /><br />Oh if anyone wants one of these boards, just send me your address and I will snail mail it to you.

Anyway, it all depends on production costs.  The circuitry itself is super cheap.  It's the connector, cabling, assembly, and testing I'm uncertain about.  I was hoping to get something going by the end of the year, but it doesn't look likely at this point.  If you need it sooner, then just perform the mod.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">revfds wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I was gonna do this mod, but I'd rather be able to just buy some cables that do the same thing ya know?</div><br />I guarantee the cable will look better than the mod.

I wish I knew the difference or maybe those  consoles have a different AV port configuring (maybe they don't have composite video?????)</div><br />35% (non-RGB units) seems a lot. If the consoles without RGB were fewer in number, I'd suspect they're simply defective as I can't really imagine Nintendo produced non-RGB SNES consoles back in the day (apart from the &quot;Jr.&quot;/mini models, of course).<br /><br />I have a very old, yellowed PAL console whose RF RCA connector was dead when I bought it off eBay. Turned out an SMD capacitor had leaked, and the acid must have affected tracks on an inner PCB layer. I was able to repair the RF output after checking SNES schematics and verifying the connection on a confirmed working SNES motherboard of the same type (SNSP-CPU-02 or whatever). Works great again! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So you might want to open up at least one or two of your non-RGB SNES units and look for leaked SMD capacitors. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" />

I traced and compared almost every path and transistor, etc and they were almost exactly identical which really confused me.   My only conclusion is that the encoder chip is the cause.  <br />I don't think it's caps. They look good (not leaking) and the pic I get is total black.  I mean nothing.  Not even a hint of a pic.  It's very perplexing.   In fact, the console you were looking for and I sent is the same way.  Didn't output rgb.  Maybe you could look at it and see if you get rgb????   I'd love to know the answer to this ... I agree that it's too high of a percentage.  <br /><br /><br />Mark

Try feeding your display's sync input with either composite video (Multi-AV pin 9) directly, or with composite sync (Multi-AV pin 3). My RGB hookups are like <a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/eviltim/gamescart/gamescart.htm#snes" class="postlink">this</a>, BTW. Note that the only pin on the Multi-AV port that differs from PAL and NTSC consoles is pin 3 (NTSC: composite sync, PAL: +12 V).
