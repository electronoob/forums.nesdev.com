		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First some random notes.  I added dates just to make sure people didnt think I was ripping off the FunkyFlashCart.  Also I may be able to make some small changes to the CF interface to do generic IDE so you could attach a hard disk instead.  A CD would still need different drivers written for iso instead of fat tho.  Also for the price I am guessing more like 100-125, 150 is the highest over estimate.
<br />
<br />Let me know if I missed any questions:
<br />
<br />Bregalad:  To use CF on your computer you either need a pcmcia slot with an adapter, or a cheapo usb card reader.  There are usb card readers that do tons of types (cf, sd, mmc, smart media, memory stick, etc).
<br />
<br />dvdmth:  The limit to GameGenie codes is the hardware, and I should be able to add lots more codes with the bigger fpga.  Most likely somewhere around 6 will be max with the setup screen still looking good.  I will probably release all my docs, its all in schematic form.
<br />
<br />kyuusaku:  Slave parallel is just a mode option on the pins.  The pin to start configuration and the config clock are set up as mem mapped registers, which is some of the small chips.  The other ones are now for the flash writer handling and also the card registers.  If you press the reset button on the NES the power is still connected so ram is still valid.  I couldnt use lockout defeaters because they also break the reset button.  I will definitely release the constraints files and how to make your own mappers.
<br />
<br />Jagasian:  I havent looked at compression yet, I think having slower load times would be more annoying than having to get a bigger card.  Even my smallest card (32MB) holds ~150 games.
<br />
<br />timofonic:  I havent planned a Famicom cart mainly because I dont have one.  Most Famicom games are completely playable on the NES, and I have done ~30 Famicom mappers.  On my design the CIC will never be able to be incorporated into the fpga because the fpga gets reconfigured while the NES is running.  Because the CIC is always communicating it would reset the console once the fpga is erased.
<br />
<br />Bregalad:  Looking back at my design there are 6(edit) fpga pins going to the expansion port.  EXP0 is used by the CopyNES flash system so it shouldnt be used for mappers.  EXP1-6(edit) could be used for some kind of audio with extra hardware needed at the port.  Including those pins every i/o is used so using that fpga it will not be possible to use all the expansion pins.

<br />Well, that won't be enough pins to hold digital sound as-it I think. That's a bit a shame, but the project is cool even without this.
<br />EXP1 could be used to clock data and EXP2-5 would be the low nybble, and then the high nybble alternatively of sample data to be mixed with NES audio. Or just have it in 5-bits, but then VRCVI, VRCVII and possibly FDS audio will get partially corrupted (just a lower of quality).
<br />Ideally, a hardware switch could manually toggle between analog mode (EXP2 directly passed for FC carts using sound+FC adapter) and digital mode (for PowerPak and maybe other future designs).
<br />
<br />Oh, and one last question. Did you get all that knownledge at work, or just by yourself ? Because that's really impressive to developp such a large project for spare-time.

Dont know how much of the FDS system needs to be there to do audio, but regular FDS games wont run on this system without something like a major bios rewrite.  I havent looked at the VRC7 and generally dont know how the audio is done on any of the chips.
<br />
<br />Most of this stuff I learned in college or on my own, my job ( blantent advertising for <a href="http://www.retrousb.com" class="postlink">www.retrousb.com</a> ) isnt as hard as this.  For me any digital hardware or asm is basic, analog stuff and high level programming languages are confusing.  Actually havent programmed in C in a few years and never done anything serious in oo languages.

<br />You only need one pin for digital sound output as long as you toggle it really fast. Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and modern CD players all feed a pulse-width or pulse-density modulation through a "1-bit" DAC followed by a low-pass filter. I can explain further if you'd like.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just realized something.  If you hope to implement MMC5, you may want to expand WRAM size to 64KB, since the MMC5 can support that size.  Although no commercial games used 64KB, a homebrew game might.  Also, bear in mind that there's no reliable way to detect WRAM size in the INES header, so unless you plan on CRC-based detection, you may need to assume a full 64KB size.
<br />
<br />MMC5 games using 32K of WRAM will use banks 0-3 to access each 8K section of the WRAM.  However, 16K WRAM games use bank 0 for the first half and bank 4 for the second half.  Thus, supporting 32K WRAM games will not be enough to support 16K games.  On the other hand, having a full 64K WRAM support will suffice for all MMC5 games (assuming none of them take advantage of WRAM bank mirroring).
<br />
<br />If my understanding is right, battery RAM files generated by emulators are typically 64K in size for MMC5, although some emulators (Nestopia for instance) which perform a CRC test will generate smaller .sav files based on the game being played.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't touch FDS at all if I were you.  Even if you rewrote the BIOS, some FDS games perform disk I/O directly, so those games will still not work.  Further, the user will need to be able to switch sides/disks during play, which would most likely require either a button on the cartridge or something plugged into the expansion port.

<br />Of course, you can but I didn't know this was used on NEW systems, rather on old ones. You mean the DPCM or something totally else ? CD are by definition 16-bits 44.1 kHz. Doing a similar qulity in DPCM would require a much higher frequency rate and a lowpass filter.
<br />Aside of that if you're not planning to support VRCVII I don't think that's a big issue, but VRCVI and MMC5 sound souds definitely easy to implement. Both will ned not-so-complicated sequencial logic, a digital channel adder and a DAC. MMC5 has 2 4-bit square wave channels, so basically adding them will have a 5-bit result. VRCVI has 2 4-bit square wave channels, and one 5-bit saw wave channel, and adding them alltogether will make a 6-bit result.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />iNES 2.0 by KH now has complete wram sizing, is there real location for this doc?  Cant just let a game have the full 32/64KB when it only uses 8KB because there could be mirroring problems.  The bank 0/4 problem isnt really a problem when the hardware can easily rearrange the banks.  The 512KB prg code space could also be used for wram if the game is small enough.  It has been too long since I looked at the mmc5 games...  I was hoping to support Grand Theftendo but have never gotten any response about what it needs, most likely too much prg space.  Also need to look at the Drip mapper which should be no problem.
<br />
<br />FDS disk swapping could be done by watching the controller for a button combination and jumping to bios code, but there are probably other architecture problems.  Might be an easy way using actual disk hardware instead.  I dont have any of the real hardware and getting everything ready for release will obviously be first.

<br />But what would trigger the bankswitching? On the FDS, the user mechanically bankswitches the file by ejecting the disk and flipping it.

There are a couple ways of watching for the controller, one would be to redirect the nmi and hope that games arent too spicky about having some cycles stolen.  Could also use the fpga to keep track of the result when the game reads the controller, but that assumes the game reads all of it which it probably doesnt do while waiting for a disk swap.  Now I really need to remember why I thought FDS just wouldnt work...

I think you should run each game as it once it's booted and shouldn't relocate vectors or anything.
