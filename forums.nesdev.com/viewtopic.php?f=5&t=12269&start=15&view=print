In the above case, a 3rd-party developer, a continent and a human generation removed from the original game and its developers, is never going to make something that stands up to the original.  They have neither the same emotional investment to do a good job, nor the reputation of doing a good job.<br /><br />Even reputable companies will sometimes fumble with their first set of releases for new hardware.  (Secret: they often outsource anyway...)  The important thing for the company is to have something recognizable sent out the door on schedule, not to have all routines optimized via tree searches.<br /><br />When something is lacklustre on good enough hardware, it's a human failing on the software side.  Thus systems cannot be compared to each other on mere technical terms by comparing software / game examples.

Assuming Mode 0 on the GBA, imagine having a cave level with stalagmites and stalactites composed of two foregrounds (one to cover the main sprites, one to go behind them) a standard background for the level itself, and a parallaxing far background just for kicks. Instead of having one BG map (for the stalagmites and stalactites) where I need to know which bits to flip in VRAM before writing tile data, I can just make two separate layers in VRAM and be done with it. That's the trade off I see. Instead of doing priority on a per-tile basis, the GBA just gives you more BGs to work with.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Really?

To get the intended result, you could scale them by 45 degrees each, then manually calculate the X-Y position that the red one should be. Obviously though, that cuts into CPU cycles, but depending on what you're doing, going manual may not be bad.

Why did they get rid of subtractive blending though? I guess you could pull off about the same effect by averaging really dark colors. Also, I had no idea that Sega themselves didn't make Sega Arcade Gallery. I'm sure it would have been made much better if they did.

The Sonic Spinball port was made off the original source code (which they found by pure luck at the house of somebody who worked at STI, since Sega had lost the source code), which was written in C so in theory the gameplay could easily be converted as-is on the GBA (maybe altering some stuff like the size of int - EDIT: actually I think 68000 defaults to 32-bit int...), and it was still a very lackluster port. And most of the time the developers who port the game don't even have the source code in the first place.<br /><br />Also on a non-GBA example, let's not forget the 3DO port of Doom, which was done in 10 weeks because of incompetent executives...

(Well I guess Sonic Spinball isn't exactly &quot;processor intensive&quot;) Also, I seems like companies totally discarding their source code seems like a <strong>major</strong> issues with ports. (What is STI? I looked it up Google and got, you know,  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  and I also got a Texas gun manufacturer.) One of the examples of a port made without the source code is R-Type 3 for the GBA, which is an abomination. (<strong>VERY</strong> sh*ty music and a lot of the sound affects are either changed or flat out removed. The collision detection is atrocious and the force is noticeably dumber too. They also got rid of the awesome opening for some reason.) Just looking at the box art, you can tell you're in for a &quot;ride&quot; (Considering I beat the SNES game on the second loop with all three forces several times, I could probably do a better job replicating it.)<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah but C was usually avoided like the plague for games back then because compilers weren't exactly great at optimizing (not to mention C being quite wasteful on a machine with such low resources available, remember there's only 64KB of RAM) and a human programming in assembler still had a much bigger chance to make the code faster and taking up less memory. It was only in the mid-'90s that using C for games became more widespread.<br /><br />Sonic Spinball was made in C because the game was done in a rush (it was made specifically because they were already aware that Sonic 3 wouldn't make its way to 1993 christmas). If I recall correctly they only had 9 months of which only 6 could be spent developing. The result wasn't bad considering the constraints =P (also probably explains why there are only four levels, and why the music licensing issue was only noticed at last moment)<br /><br />I know that Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was programmed in C, and probably the earlier ones (in fact, I think the code from the ports are actually based on the arcade version, which most of the dumbing down being either hardware limitations or running out of ROM space). I know that the XBand firmware was programmed in C too. I imagine Hard Drivin' as well since the port had the same programmer who was hired for Sonic Spinball (no idea if it uses assembly for the drawing routines, though).
