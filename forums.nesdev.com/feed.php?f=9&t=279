I tend to play in 3.636x by 3x scaled window on a 1024x768 LCD panel.<br /></div><br /><br />The NES outputs a picture on a television that takes up the whole screen, and a little more if you factor overscan into the mix.  On my CRT monitor, if you use a 648x480 full-screen resolution with 2x sized pixels, you will have NES video in a squarish picture.  While 256x240 is very square like, the huge horizontal borders would not have been tolerated on a television screen.  So Nintendo made or allowed the video to stretch out to cover the screen.  However, each stretched pixel is the same size as every other stretched pixel.  (More or less) When emulators use a full-screen option, they interpolate the image with different sized pixels.  Todays emulators don't try to manipulate the CRT to provide for custom non Direct-X based full-screen screen ratios.  <br /><br />The picture looks ugly with anything less than using integral horizontal to vertical pixel ratios.  In FCE Ultra I use 5x Horizontal to 4x Vertical pixel ratio at 1280x960 to get a beautiful full-screen picture.  It looks <strong>very </strong> close to what the NES would display on a TV and can be tweaked by the monitor controls to allow for overscan.  You may wish to try it if you have an LCD that supports that resolution natively (few do.)  If only Nintendulator could do this I would be very happy.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Apr 18, 2005 1:29 pm</p><hr />

I would also note that Nintendulator was not written with portability in mind.  I know the xbox is somewhat Windows like, but this still seems a bit of a stretch.  I did attempt a Linux port of it a while back.  I only spent a few days on it, but it would have required a complete re-write of more than half of the code.  In addition the reusable part - the guts of the logic, are (out of necessity) somewhat confusing.  On top of that when I was doing this about a year ago, the code was not very well documented.<br />In the end I think porting Nintendulator would be at least as difficult as writing a new one from scratch.<br />On a side note, Nintendulator works well under Linux using Wine.  Nintendulator is THE tool for NES development, nothing else compares, so having it accessible on a more robust development platform is fantastic.  Thanks Q for all your work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=29">teaguecl</a> — Mon Apr 18, 2005 10:47 am</p><hr />

VirtuaNES is excellent for running Famicom games, Famicom Disk System games and ports of Famicom games to the NES (i.e. NES games from Japanese companies.)  It is not so good at running PAL NES games or games programmed by European companies like Rare and Codemasters (Micro Machines, Dizzy).  I don't think it supports the Game Genie (I'm not sure about VS System games.)  It has scanline glitches in games like Crystalis and Bad Dudes.  <br /><br />Only Nintendulator can claim mastery over Micro Machines.

Or, just do what I did and get an EPROM programmer, all the different types (including Famicom carts) of mapper carts that I wanted to play, and hack up the carts to accept eproms. It really doesn't cost much, but it takes some time to modify the carts, and round up the rare ones (that no one wants to play so they are cheap, for now).<br /><br />I also bought a FDS RAM adapter (a HUGE thanks to Brad Taylor for his FDS Loader), constructed the cable so I could play all the FDS games.<br /><br />VirtuaNES can be set up, so its almost 100% authentic, and you can even find adapters these days for the controllers.<br /><br />I also built a MAME cabinet that uses a TV (hacked it for RGB), and it looks just like the arcade units, you can't tell the difference.<br /><br />I was thinking it would be super cool, if someone could adapt a current NES emulator to use the mame video drivers in DOS, so you could have 15khz output, and use an arcade monitor, it would look totally authentic.<br /><br />In fact you could even get real dot crawl, by using a RGB -&gt; NTSC encode.
