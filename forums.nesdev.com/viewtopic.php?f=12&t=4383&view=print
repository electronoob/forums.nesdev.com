The source code to an average early Super Nintendo game. Hopefully someone will be able to make good use of it, because anything is better than it sitting on my or anyone else's shelf or hard drive gathering dust. But if you do make some use of it, PLEASE let me know!
<br />
<br />Find it on my www site.
<br />
<br />And if you're into to prototypes or Satellaview items, I post those every time I get a chance to sit down and work on the same site as the above.

<br />
<br />They're in there because the only extract correctly on a certain few windows apps, plus they have the original time stamps.
<br />No space wasted, I just re-compressed it sans zips and its the same size.

<br />
<br />No worries. It was released in 1993, so it's already 15 years old. So long as Disney / Bono do not extend copyright further, it should be public domain (and thus, legally useful) in a mere eighty years. So yeah, our grand kids might be able to make use of this shortly after their retirement.
<br />
<br />That said, I did want to thank you for your work on getting more BS-X images out there. That's very much needed and extremely valuable, thank you :)

<br />
<br />The rest of my policy basically rests on "Will be removed by request of owner". It's just a link, after all -- if they wanted to get rid of it permanently, they would probably go after the people hosting it.

Admins just need to use a mix of good judgment and common sense when deciding whether to remove links, taking into account both the reasoning behind the initial post and the content behind the link. What do you think a copyright holder is more likely to target: a fully-compiled ROM image of a popular commercial game, or crusty old source code from a defunct developer's backup disks? Which one would actually be usable in some way by the majority of users that download it? Which one still has the potential to bring in money, via VC/XBLA/retro game compilations?
