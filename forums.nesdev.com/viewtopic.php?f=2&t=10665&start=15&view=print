That ability is pretty much the definition of Turing completeness. So yeah, it's fully doable and not even difficult: Just compile any GB emulator's C code on a C compiler that supports the NES target for sufficiently big programs... or write the emulator from scratch in 6502 assembly if you have the time for it. <br /><br />The real challenge would be to get any speed that gives a decent emulation experience... but if you've already sacrificed that criteria, then it's a no-brainer. So what are you trying to get at here? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Even though I don't think efficiency has the highest priority in an experiment like this (getting games running is the real goal), anyone attempting it should aim for the highest efficiency possible, so there's definitely room for discussion.<br /><br />For example, the Game Boy has 8 KB of main RAM and 8KB of VRAM. If you implement that as 2 PRG-RAM pages on the NES, you'll spend a lot of time just bankswitching when the emulated CPU is copying data to VRAM. And then there would even be a third step, when the contents of the emulated VRAM are used to render tiles to CHR-RAM. Is there any way to optimize this process?

But yeah, I might have used the word wrong and it might not be a novelty now, but I bet it was back when it was created!<br /><br />What I meant is that the Chip-8 is a weird little thing that's mildly interesting but doesn't really capture people's attention for long, and since a sluggish emulator will certainly not have many fans either it will probably not even be noticed outside the circle of NES programmers... but a Game Boy running inside the NES CPU? That's big (even if it's unplayable)!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This thread reminded me of an emulation approach I thought of a while back, if you want to hear my weird mapper-assisted idea.  I always thought a Colecovision emu for NES would be amusing, so on with my Squeedo mapper I wondered how well it would work if the on-board PIC emulated the Z80.  When doing video/sound/controller I/O it would trigger an IRQ for the NES to handle it.  This PIC (18F family) has up to 64kB of ROM, and 3.9kB of RAM.  One problem I can forsee is if the game does a lot of VRAM reading, the PIC would have to request it from the NES and that could bog down.  I don't know how frequently, obviously it would vary widely.  We all know that's almost never done on NES, but Coleco has 1kB of RAM and 16kB of VRAM, so it's not hard to imagine how it'd be useful.  And it sorta helps that it can access VRAM during rendering, heh.<br /><br />Can't say I ever wanted to write a Z80 emu for PIC, but I would probably try to use it if it existed (maybe compiling a C version could work, I never really considered that).  I know someone who wrote a 6502 emulator for PIC, I've been telling him he should make it available for this kind of fun stuff.  Then one could run their code on a faster emulated CPU, on the NES.<br /><br />Also funny to note in this thread, is that the CopyNES debugger &quot;Microbug&quot; emulates a 6502 on the 6502.  It's pretty nifty to see it in action.

It was twice as slow as original GB (if not more).<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://psxdev.narod.ru/download/GBEMU_psx_bin.rar">http://psxdev.narod.ru/download/GBEMU_psx_bin.rar</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Not sure you can even emulate it on NES, since GB use different memory mapping and RAM size. NES just have not enough RAM to emulate 8+8 KB of GameBoy's RAM and VRAM.<br /><br />Although GB CPU can be emulated easily, just for fun.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, NES has 32kb of RAM, isn't it? And 8+8kb = 16kb. Dedicating first (or last) 16kb of NES RAM for GB and using only first (or last) 16 for actual emulation (perhaps with custom mapper) we could do it. Granted 16kb isn't much, but so is 32kb (even if it is twice as large).
