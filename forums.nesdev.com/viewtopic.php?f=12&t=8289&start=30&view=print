I am in the process in developing my own SNES game. I even Contacted NINTENDO for this but they said that I have to be a registered gaming company to request licensing. 
<br />
<br />If you guys have any information about this, I will greatly appreciate it.

<br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Don't bother contacting Nintendo, you got a form letter. They're extremely picky about who they license, and unless you are actually an established game developer with enough money to show them (as they have capital requirements, if I remember correctly), you have no hope of being licensed. And at this point they no longer support the SNES, so even if you met their licensing requirements they would just tell you that the console isn't supported anymore.
<br />
<br />Echoing what MottZilla said, producing the cartridge is the <strong>last</strong> of your concerns. Worry about that once you have designed, programmed, and tested a game that SNES collectors would actually want to buy.

Compare all the shovelware on the consoles in the early 1980s when the North American console gaming market went into a recession. Nintendo's policies are a direct response to this so-called "great crash".

<br />After startup costs and about 5000 games later, maybe it'll be cheap after that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I picked one up at my local Fry's and it works really well actually! It does require a little Dremel work to get it nice-nice, but the finished product is good.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.frys.com/product/5610021" class="postlink">Philmore plastic battery holder</a>
<br />
<br />The modifications that are needed:
<br /><ul>- The terminals need to be pulled out before working with the clip. They come out without much fuss with a pair of pliers. Just be sure not to twist the metal such that won't fit back in the clip correctly and make good contact with the cell battery. <br />- It has three plastic feet that can be cut off very easily. There are also two larger plastic feet which support the terminals. They also need to be cut off. Again easy to do with a standard cutoff disc. <br />- You need to bore into the top clip support at a 45 degree angle. The pins do not line up with the PCB's original holes. By doing this you can bend the clip at an angle and get both clips to line up *perfectly*. Doing this makes it feel loose, but it is quite secure once soldered in place!<br />- Finally, the lead that goes in the bottom of the clip needs to be elongated by trimming down the sides and thereby making a longer looking lead. By removing the support feet, you end up with a little extra metal that won't fit through the PCB's hole. Sounds messy, but it only takes a microt.</ul>
<br />The end result is a tidy looking clip with a battery that can easily be replaced that fits inside the standard SNES cart without any pressure on the PCB or the sides of the cart. It's very svelte. I have been taking lots of photos of everything I've been doing, so I'll post those up with all of my documentation of this process once I'm finished.
<br />
<br />I've got another clip that I've seen <a href="http://www.snescentral.com/forum/index.php?topic=345.0" class="postlink">someone else use</a>. But it's much too tall to work without cutting the top plastic down considerably as well as altering the leads. It's do able, but if you saw the clip up close it's a lot more work to alter than the other one I found. It also doesn't look so nice. :\
<br />
<br />Still waiting on the DorkbotPDX PCB's for the Willem adapter. Laen said they should be shipped out on Saturday or Monday with profuse apologies for the  much elongated order time. Then I should be ready to get my chip programmin' on!

<br />
<br />I'm going to solder another 29F032 to an adapter board in an effort to isolate the problem. Checking all the leads on the adapter seems to work okay, though it might be the ZIF socket I installed in the adapter not correctly contacting all of the pins. Hard to test.
<br />
<br />rkrenicki: Firstly, thanks again for sharing the PCB design. I have some thoughts about the adapter board design... maybe make the board a tad longer? A ZAF socket and the A19-21 pins at the end are a ridiculously tight fit! The holes were a good size this time for sure though. Might also be nice to have holes for the extra 4 legs on a 40 pin ZIF even if they don't actually need to be soldered. Bending them out of the way is okay I guess, but it'd be tidier just having a few more holes on a slightly longer board. The boards are cheap enough that adding another half inch or so isn't really going to cause any significant boost in their price.
