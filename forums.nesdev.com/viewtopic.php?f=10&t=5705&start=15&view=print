<br />
<br />But then you can aproximate anything pretty much with such "fractions of power of two", for example 13/128 is a good aproximation of 1/10. 51/512 is an even better aproximation, and so on. As you get a precision of n bits under the fraction bar, it becomes the same a a integer division with n bits of result.
<br />
<br />OK I'll stop being picky.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There seems quite a discussion here. I'm not scared away at all. On the contrary, I read every word posted and get many valuable ideas and thoughts I've never thought before. Really appreciate. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> 
<br />
<br />Now I'm reconsidering my gaming system. Hope can make it more friendly to 6502. Also, I'm studying the 8-bit divide, LFSR, and PRNG. It's good to my coding skill. Not sure if I can understand them though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> 
<br />
<br />I've checked <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_feedback_shift_register">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_fee ... t_register</a><!-- m -->, but still can't figure out how it works. It's full of terms I don't understand. Can anyone just briefly explain the idea of it with words not so abstract please? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, a shift register shifs right or left (doesn't matter really), and when that is done, 1 bit is "out" of the register and 1 bit is "in".
<br />
<br />When doing it on a 6502 (8-bit register), the bit who is "out" goes to C, and the bit who is "in" is either the old value of C (ROL/ROR instructions) or always 0 (ASL/LSR instructions).
<br />
<br />By making the bit who is "in" a function of the current state of the register, using AND, OR and NOT operations (this includes XOR too) on bits who are inside the registers, it is possible to make it act as a pseudo-RNG, but it have to be seed with an initial value, and after a while the values will repeat. The longer it takes until they repeat, the better is your pseudo-RNG. Look for code example for what functions works the best for a long repeat sequence.
<br />
<br />In software, this will translate with you taking some value from the register, mess up with some AND, OR, EOR instructions until you get the "in" bit in your carry, and do ROR/ROL operations on your registers (you'll probably want more than 8-bit to get a decently long sequence).
<br />I guess an example of it is found in the FDS bios, which you can find disassembled and commented using google.
<br />
<br />I can't tell you much more because I'm unfamiliar with that method. In my game I use the multiply &amp; add method, which works well too. The big advantage of the shift register method is that it is simpler to do in hardware when dealing with flip-flops and AND/OR/NOT gates. As long as you have a CPU, it doesn't matter if you use the add/substract, shift register, or if you're lazy fast counter method.
