		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm baaack...just posted NESICIDE v0.2.  As the version suggests, it is a pretty incremental update.
<br />
<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nesicide.com">www.nesicide.com</a><!-- w -->
<br />
<br />Things added/changed:
<br />0. Palette updated -- thanks BMF54123.  Working on palette import but haven't settled on a file format...is there one?!
<br />1. Window maximize will double nametable size if window is big enough.
<br />2. Smarter combining of auto-generated sourcecode objects into ROM image on assembling.
<br />  a)Included ".incobj" directive in assembler that allows explicit placement of auto-generated sourcecode in ROM (for PRG-ROM pattern placement, for example).
<br />  b)Updated SimpleParallaxDemo to show usage of .incobj directive.
<br />3. Minor GUI improvements.
<br />
<br />Things in-work, possibly for v0.3:
<br />0. Subroutine library (mapper interface subs, typical activity subs, etc.)
<br />1. Nametable compression algorithm support (RLE with vertical or horizontal striping, ... are there others?).
<br />2. Enhancements to assembler to support anonymous labeling.
<br />
<br />I've also started working on an MMC1 demo.
<br />
<br />I'd love to hear more of what you all would want / not want in future versions.  I still have these on the list:
<br />
<br />0. Palette numbering.
<br />1. Portable file format (XML...)
<br />2. Auto-create patterns on nametable painting or BMP import.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />Yeah, same as the palette I uploaded. 64 colors, 3 bytes per color (RGB), 192 bytes.

<br />-You have developed the assembler that comes integrated with NESICIDE and I am curious about its features compared for example with ASM6 or even CA65 (wich being a generic 6502 assembler has lots of stuff that may be omitted in a NES-specific assembler).

<br />-Also I wondered how much different the syntax is in respect to these assemblers.

<br />-Is there any way to export the entire assembler source code to a text file? More for backup purposes of the code.

<br />Any way, good job, I really look forward to see NESICIDE going on! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

All of the Command Modes and Basic Arguments are supported.  Normal labels are supported but, as I said, I plan to implement temporary labels also.  I don't yet, but plan to support ".ascii" directive.  Argument construction is partially supported (no expression support yet, in the plans).  ".text" and ".data" named or anonymous segmenting is supported.  ".checkpc" will be supported.  ".include" is ".incasm" in mine (not sure why...I should change that back!).  Macros are not supported.  The maturity level of the assembler tends to evolve as I realize I need new things from it, like the ability to have it mid-parse call back into NESICIDE to get the assembly source for an .incobj'ed element and assemble it into the stream.  I had previously just shoved all of the assembly source for all elements together (even if they were not used by the ROM) and passed the whole mess to the assembler.  This, of course, leads to inefficient use of ROM space!  Thus, the .incobj directive allows clear and direct specification of what elements should be included and where.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SaucJedi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Also I wondered how much different the syntax is in respect to these assemblers.</div><br />Shouldn't be much different other than what I outlined above.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SaucJedi wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Is there any way to export the entire assembler source code to a text file?

<br />There should be, but there isn't.  I'll add one.

<br />If you go to the Screenshots page, there are two downloadable demos there at the top of the page -- yes, they are very small.  I will post more as I create them.  Right now I'm working on an MMC1 demo and have found a couple of assembler issues so that one will be put on the site when I put the next version of NESICIDE up.  Ahh, the drawbacks of not having an assembler DLL separate...

<br />Because I put most effort into the context menus.  I rarely use the application menus except for to load/save or create a new project.  A Visual Studio-like "Wizard" interface would be nice, I agree.  That would also provide the opportunity to create a "New Project" that is, for example, based on a No Mapper ROM, a MMC1 Mapper ROM, etc.  I am working on this!
<br />
<br />I don't think newbie-ness has anything to do with it...you bring up a good point about the File New/Load/Save.

<br />Yup, but the small window (loading) remains in background (locked).
