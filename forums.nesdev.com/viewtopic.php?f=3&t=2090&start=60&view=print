You seem to think saying that has any influence on whether there are images out there that don't have all the information necessary to disambiguate it? Your only choice is to either distribute a database to promote iNES images to NES2 images or to reject iNES images that are not unambiguous.

A 256KiB game cannot exist on UNROM. The latch exists either way. The only difference is whether the ROM has an A17 line to be connected to. It is clear how the size of PRG disambiguates the board. It is only &quot;sloppy&quot; if you think it is meaningful to talk about how UxROM is actually a subset of mapper 78 or something.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">To be more precise I'm more interested in mappers that have a lot of boards like MMC3.</div> The point of NES2 never was to make a &quot;compressed UNIF&quot;. It will only lead to frustration if you continue to think of it that way. TKSROM and TLSROM are mapper 118. TQROM is mapper 119. NesCartDB has no instantiations of TEROM and TFROM using hardwired mirroring, but when we find one it will already have a submapper earmarked for that purpose. The rest are honestly functionally equivalent.

I'm under the impression that memory sizes are exactly what Nintendo used to decide which board to use when manufacturing a game. Look at all the SxROM and TxROM boards that differ only in memory size. For example, MMC1 + PRG ROM over 256 KiB + 8 KiB CHR RAM + 8 KiB PRG RAM = SUROM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How on earth are we going to go back and find all of these ROMs and actually update them so that they are 2.0 compatible?</div><br />bsnes includes a &quot;purify&quot; tool that scans ROMs and corrects their headers. (In the case of Super NES ROMs, &quot;correcting&quot; involves stripping the copier header entirely.) A similar tool for NES emulation could scan a collection of iNES ROMs, possibly using a database of commercial releases prior to 1997 as lidnariq mentioned, and convert them to the equivalent NES 2.0 header.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Under where it says 'proposed' solution. Should that adjective still be there or is it safe to assume that all data present can be safely implemented?</div><br />As far as I can tell, it's been a stable spec for several years, and even implemented in a few emulators.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Regardless of what iNES was ever supposed to be, it is what it needs to be and that is to carry all of the necessary cartridge information that would influence its emulation.</div><br />Which in turn is also all of the necessary cartridge information that would influence its reproduction, apart from label graphics. Tetris by Tengen is CNROM unless you don't consider Tengen's clone board to be CNROM. Battle Kid 1 is UOROM unless you don't consider the ReproPak board to be UOROM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I care whether a ROM is UNROM or UOROM (Mapper 2 btw) because UOROM uses an extra bit when mapping ROM to 8000.

I'm aware of one FPGA implementation of the NES that uses the mapper 28 code path to emulate mappers 0, 2, 3, 7, and 34 (CHR RAM variant).

I don't know what you mean by that.<br /><br />I am fully aware that a computer program could be written to go back and update all of the 1.0 headers to 2.0 but that would be a big task and of course it would only affect the ROMs of the people who actually use it. Plus what if they use GoodTools to validate the header again the new information would be lost.<br /><br />Just to clear things up here a bit I asked if the iNES 2.0 header that appears in the wiki was OK to use and it is, cool.<br /><br />The point that I am trying to make is, I would like to be able to use a bit in the iNES 2.0 header to determine which board/submapper is being used.<br /><br />Mapper 2 - 256kB Size - Most likely UOROM<br />Mapper 2 - 128kB Size - Most likely UNROM<br /><br />This is a method that could be/is employed to determine which board/submapper is being used but I would rather get the information from the header. What about a Mapper 002 game that has 192kB of PRG? I'm not saying that a game like that exists but it would break any code that check the size of a ROM to detect board. Whats more what would happen if said ROM did use UOROM and it tried to switch to a non-existent bank?

Among Nintendo discrete boards and Nintendo boards using Nintendo MMCs, there is no existing UxROM board with more than one such ROM. The only game with non-power-of-two PRG ROM that I know of is Action 52, and that's because it uses three PRG ROM chips each 512 KiB in size. Currently, 192 KiB of PRG on mapper 2 is &quot;undefined behavior&quot;, and a header auditing tool should emit a diagnostic. If such a game would be released, which is unlikely because 256 KiB and larger flash is already very cheap, then the definition of these mappers would need to be updated to show how that mapper is being used in practice. I'd be willing to propose one precise definition for sums of two powers of two (3n^2 or 5n^2)

(The other iNES images are hacks and translations that depend on specific emulator implementations, and the correct parsing is not known)<br /><br />The package cost was simply too much larger than the mask ROM cost until the SNES hit 10mbit games.
