<br />
<br />Image Name/CPU/Mem Usage
<br />
<br />zsnesw.exe/00/22,560K
<br />
<br />0% CPU usage??? How the hell does it manage that? ZSNES uses no hacks and is very accurate, so shouldn't it require like 750Mhz+ of CPU power? I have a Pentium D 3.2Ghz btw. The memory usage looks big, so maybe it trades off memory to ease the CPU burden. But memory is so much slower than CPU's nowadays, so I don't know.
<br />
<br />And before you ask 'Are you sure the focus wasn't list when you were looking at Windows Task Manager?', the focus was not lost. I had 60FPS and the game played perfectly.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ZSNES was written in x86 assembly language back in the days of 133 MHz Pentium 1 CPUs. But is it really as accurate as bsnes in emulating things such as mid-scanline raster effects, DRAM refresh wait states, and APU/CPU sync?
<br />
<br />The 65C816 CPU includes an instruction 'WAI' to wait for the next interrupt. It puts the CPU into a sleep mode, drawing much less current than spin-waiting on a register. Emulators can sleep too, as they don't have to emulate the CPU until the next interrupt. Properly architected games that use WAI, such as the Donkey Kong Country series, run faster in emulators on handhelds than other games. So if SFA2 uses 'wai', it might use less CPU time than other games.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_D" class="postlink">Wikipedia says Pentium D is a dual-core NetBurst CPU</a>. (NetBurst cores were also used in Pentium IV and some Xeon CPUs.) All but the earliest NetBurst CPUs have had Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel's version of simultaneous multithreading), so the tight loops of emulation might be running almost entirely inside the cache. Does Windows properly account for all cycles used by a thread on an SMT CPU?

<br />
<br />Edit #1: According to my computer, my Pentium D is w/o HT.
<br />
<br />Edit #2: I tested bsnes with the intro screen and the reading was from 10 to as high as 27, with an average of about 20. I ran the intro on ZSNES and actually got a reading of 1% at one point, but it was mostly at 0.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Your CPU usage probably isn't being reported correctly. ZSNES will use all the CPU time it can get when in emulation. And even on the GUI it won't be 0. I run an AMD 64 3200+, and while I have no trouble running ZSNES or BSNES, cpu usage is maxed when running ZSNES 1.51. 
<br />
<br />Also, ZSNES is a good and fairly accurate emulator, but not perfect. I've heard and seen they've improved ZSNES alot, but it will likely never match or not anytime soon, match BSNES in accuracy. 
<br />
<br />Also I kind of hate something ZSNES probably caused. Several SNES hacks were programmed and tested on it and thought to work because they worked on ZSNES when infact they crashed and burned on real hardware. This pissed me off since that is what I was using as backup devices aren't exactly new or hard to get ahold of. 
<br />
<br />But anyway, ZSNES has no black magic.

<br />
<br />It's still a lot harder to find SNES backup devices than GBA backup devices. I know eBay bans them. For the GBA, US residents with $30 and a couple weeks to wait can get a SuperCard miniSD at dealextreme.com. Do they even still make new SNES backup units?
<br />
<br />So which emulator is Super Nintendulator, and which is Snestopia?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ha ha. NES and SNES were different situations. NES development hardware was alot less accessible than SNES development or backup hardware. Remember you didn't just need a soldering iron, but a decent PC, EPROM programmer and plenty of EPROMs. Not to mention you had to have the hardware knowledge to wire the EPROMs to the board and all. But I'm sure you were just being dramatic. :p
<br />
<br />It's harder to find SNES devices than GBA devices because the SNES backup devices never were made cheap. $200 - $300 backup devices and such, compared to the cheap SuperCard devices for GBA. But still, if you've got 80 bucks or so you can buy a SNES Flash Cartridge which Tototek still makes I believe. 
<br />
<br />Snestopia would have to be ZSNES or SNES9X I guess, though Nestopia probably does a better job of accuracy. And ofcourse Super Nintendulator would be BSNES. Hopefully BSNES would inspire people to write things for the SNES now that you can use it as a reliable testing tool where as before you had no guarentees with SNES9X or ZSNES.

<br />But a Street Fighter game will have sprites jumping around, parallax backgrounds, and often palette animations. I know at least Super SF2 uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling" class="postlink">the layer, sprite, and raster methods</a> all at the same time. How much do dirty rects help in such a situation?

<br />
<br />Exactly what I thought. I don't think that using dirty rectangles in an emulator is really all the possible unless it is a chess game or something, or there are 1000's of very small dirty rectangles.

<br />
<br />I guess ZSNES is pretty much comparable to NESticle, it is fast, run on DOS, and most people uses it but isn't really accurate, while still running most commercial games (okay, I guess it's still more accurate than NESticle, but as I know so few about SNES I can't really tell).
<br />SNES9x is more accurate at emulating sound (I don't know if it still is, because I don't regularly check for new versions, as I hate to upgrade things).
<br />
<br />I don't know that much about BSNES, but I'll look forward for it, especially if it is the "Super Nintendulator". Also, there is 3 "main" SNES emulators, and maybe a few "sub" SNES emulators, while there is at least 10 "main" NES emulators and about fifty "sub" emulators. (by "sub" I mean unfinished, uinccurate or unpopular).

HDMA timing, varying memory bus timings, and the SPC-700 are all things one doesn't have to deal with for NES emulation. On the other hand, apparently games are generally less-sensitive to precise timing as NES games are, since the extra support hardware takes some of the burden off cycle-timed code; put another way, the SNES has a richer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Binary_Interface" class="postlink">ABI</a> for games to use, thus making emulation generally easier.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">SNES9x is more accurate at emulating sound (I don't know if it still is, because I don't regularly check for new versions, as I hate to upgrade things).</div><br />Say "SNES9x <strong>was</strong> more accurate at emulating sound [...]" if you don't want to piss people off with sloppy wording.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I don't know that much about BSNES, but I'll look forward for it, especially if it is the "Super Nintendulator".</div>
<br />Not yet, since its PPU isn't cycle-based like Nintendulator.
