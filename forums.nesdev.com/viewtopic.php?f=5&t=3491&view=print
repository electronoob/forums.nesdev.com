		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd like to get into NES or SNES development, but which one is easier to start with?
<br />
<br />It seems likes theres a lack of docs for the SNES, as I couldn't find much out there, as compared to the NES.
<br />
<br />I'm fairly familiar with 6502 machine language, as I used to write apps for the C64 (not games). Having kernel routines to do the basics makes things easier.

<br />
<br />If you're considering the Super NES, consider developing for the Game Boy Advance instead. It's much easier to get GBA copiers so that you can try your code on the hardware.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here you are some of my impressions, wich are just impressions that may help and nothing ultimate or anything.
<br />
<br />NES pros :
<br />- Hardware easier to understand and hack
<br />- Graphics are simple to made
<br />- It's developpement scene is quite expanded
<br />- This is an overall nice system
<br />
<br />NES cons :
<br />- Few sprites on the screen (especially 8 per line)
<br />- Cartridge hardware can get a headache
<br />- Slow CPU and very time-critical hardware
<br />
<br />SNES pros :
<br />- Better and brighter graphics, including mode 7
<br />- The sound CPU is downright awesome
<br />- This is an overall nice system
<br />- Fewer different "standard" cartridge hardware
<br />
<br />SNES cons :
<br />- It's developpement scene is very restriced
<br />- Communication between CPU and Sound CPU can get annoying and slow (but once the routine are written they are written for good)
<br />- A lot of things behind the SNES are still poorly and inncacurately doccumented, untested, unverified.
<br />- While the graphics are better, it's harder to actually put them in a good use without having doing prior NES developpement.
<br />
<br />GBA pros :
<br />- Developpement scense is very very large
<br />- Can be programmed in C (for people used to windows)
<br />- Better and brigher graphics, including modes similar to SNES' mode 7.
<br />
<br />GBA cons :
<br />- Sound replaying takes incredibly high amount of CPU time as each sample has to be manually mixed and output manually (but once the sound playing routine have been written it has been written for good)
<br />- While the graphics are better, it's harder to actually put them in a good use without having doing prior NES developpement.
<br />- The screen is small

<br />Only because Nintendo has stopped making the GameCube and Game Boy Player.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Whether you choose a high level language or low level, your algorithms will be pretty much the same. I don't think there's a real advantage to either. The question is whether or not you want to do a console game or PC game. A PC game will probably be less manageable when written in assembly than a NES game. 
<br />
<br />If you know C, I wouldn't waste time with Python. SDL or Allegro can be set up pretty easily and there are many tutorials out there to get people started with game programming.

<br />No, I think that's okay after you sucessfully made your sound code have the desired capacibilities and takes 20% of the CPU.
<br />And the tone generators are somewhat limited, espeically the while noise wich sound horribles on all gameboys (unlike the NES noise wich sounds much better).
