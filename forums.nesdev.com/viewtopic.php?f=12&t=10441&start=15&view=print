Are you saying they have a patent for that already? OR, that the prior physical manifestation of something like my idea is enough to prevent my own patent of the idea?</div><br />The latter. If someone else invented and published what you claim is your invention, your patent should be rejected for lack of novelty. The application will be sent back to you, and you will be asked to make your claims more specific so as not to cover what already exists. It's called &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_(patent)" class="postlink">lack of novelty</a>&quot; or &quot;claims anticipated by prior art&quot;.<br /><br />Similar to novelty is that your invention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventive_step_and_non-obviousness" class="postlink">must not be the most obvious solution</a> to the problem. This is where the J-Cart comes in. A MIDI controller is a user input device, just as a Sega Genesis controller is an input device. A user input device connector on a game cartridge is in the prior art (as the J-Cart), and merely specializing this to MIDI would likely be obvious.

When you get that abstract, sounds like someone (the father of consoles) could make money off Microsoft and any console company that exists.<br /><br />So you're telling me that the first guy who puts an input device on a cartridge could/may have filed a patent and therefore has some sort of involvement with anyone else selling some sort of input device connected to a cartridge? regardless of the nature? (for instance I consider MIDI input of different nature from non-musical related input). However, in actual reality, this difference that I see and others may acknowledge, may in fact be coupled into the central idea of 'input device on a cartridge' as far as patent is concerned?!

Fortunately for you, a lot of this stuff you're involved with was settled quite a while ago.<br /><br />Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_v._Sony" class="postlink">this case</a> in which &quot;Tactile feedback man-machine interface device&quot; went to court, and Sony lost big time (and Microsoft settled).<br /><br />It's kind of why you'll experience this general aversion to patents. They're mostly bad news, and not at all fun to talk about on hobbyist websites. Although, occasionally, the patents do describe the internal workings of something that would be otherwise unrealistic to reverse engineer.

Patents on the NES/Famicom expired awhile ago making clones no longer a gray area. Anyway, Patents are supposed to exist to protect the inventors of new products so that they can sell whatever it is for a period of time without others just copying it. The reason being, why invest the time and money to invent anything new if someone else is just going to steal it and produce your product? You're talking about a product that would be unprofitable for anyone to copy. That's protection enough. <br /><br />The EverDrive 64 Flash cartridge was copied by the chinese. However, only the older version of it. The newer version was better protected against copying. This is the sort of thing to do to prevent copying, not a patent and legal options that you can't afford. It's different for a large company ofcourse. The EverDrive 64 targets a fairly small market, but it's still larger than a SNES MIDI cartridge. The other thing is people *usually* respect homebrew community people and don't rip them off.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think if your are confident with your invention, patent it. The innovative ideas or design are highly required and appreciated. You can restrict others from making or copying your invention. Patents are meant to simply promote innovation and creativity by motivating the timely disclosure of how to make and use different inventions and also by protecting a number of investments carried out to commercialize these inventions.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think it would even be patentable, hardware-wise it's really simple.  I'm no patent lawyer, but I don't think it's necessarily innovative just because it's on SNES.  It's just using MIDI to do what MIDI was designed to do..  That being said, it would be cool to see an SNES MIDI cartridge, I hope your project succeeds.<br /><br />Best protection I'd recommend would be to require a read-protected MCU or similar hardware.  I'm sure you'd want a UART anyways.
