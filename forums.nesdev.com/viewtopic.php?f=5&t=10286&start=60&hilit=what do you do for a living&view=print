Since then, I've worked only non-technical/technology kind of jobs. The past 4 years, I've been doing this:<br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/work/pic1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://www.pcedev.net/work/pic2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />Kind of... mural-ish things, if <span class="posthilit">you</span> will. They're just silhouettes, but they can be really big (60ft wide be 12ft tall). It's all free hand, but I'm not allowed to make up <span class="posthilit">what</span> I want. I'm given <span class="posthilit">a</span> pic <span class="posthilit">for</span> reference, as to <span class="posthilit">what</span> to paint on the wall. Though I tend to take liberties, cause I get bored. It's all done by hand; I sketch it all out with <span class="posthilit">a</span> small brush first - then start adding in details. Sometimes, the pics are huge repeating patterns. That's <span class="posthilit">a</span> bit more difficult to get right, by hand. But I have <span class="posthilit">a</span> system down <span class="posthilit">for</span> it. I've been doing this <span class="posthilit">for</span> stores, and it can up to <span class="posthilit">a</span> month to complete <span class="posthilit">a</span> store (about 100-120 hours). <br /><br /> Though, I've been trying my hardest to go back to school. To try and get <span class="posthilit">a</span> job in coding (having no degree or direct work related experience, I can't get passed the interview process of companies). Money is tight, so things don't come together so easily (my plans). But such is life <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

But I mostly focus on production, burn-in and functional tests of boards, calibration, quality control, board mods and upgrades (including preventive maintenance), and evaluate/repair boards that have been in the field.  It's critical equipment <span class="posthilit">for</span> all types of medical research, among other stuff.  So I can take it seriously, and have fun because I like working with electronics and learning.  Been doing that full-time <span class="posthilit">for</span> about 4 years.<br /><br />Before that, I worked <span class="posthilit">for</span> <span class="posthilit">a</span> small chemical company.  Blending product, packaging it, and I had <span class="posthilit">a</span> CDL with hazmat endorsement (everything we handled was either extremely corrosive, or extremely flammable, heheh), so I was the delivery driver as well.  I got pretty good at pushing around 55-gallon drums.  There was also some distribution involved that had me traveling to towns all over northern Indiana, n. Ohio, and s. Michigan.  That was fun, some of it was during the days of using old fashioned paper maps, too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It has it's up sides and down sides. Before the recession, pay wasn't too bad (though nothing like the IT job I had). Pay hasn't changed so much now, as so much to the lesser amount of work that I get nowadays. I scaled back my <span class="posthilit">living</span> style/expenses, originally, when I left the IT field. I prioritized <span class="posthilit">what</span> I wanted <span class="posthilit">for</span> myself and <span class="posthilit">what</span> I wanted out of life, and was able to live reasonably well. Though while I've sacrificed any long term benefit and definitely my retirement, the amount of stress was ~near~ 0. <span class="posthilit">A</span> fair trade IMO. I made <span class="posthilit">a</span> gamble; even if I lived to be old(er) - would I be happy with my life? More or less, I traded the future - <span class="posthilit">for</span> the 'now', while I was still young enough to enjoy it. <br /><br /> I was able to put more time in my high tech hobbies, as well. I was able to spend more time with my sons, raise them, actually be there mentally when I was at home/off work. I ~loved~ being stress free and the fact that I didn't have to take my 'job' home with me, every night. Some times work was physically exhausting, but that's nothing compared to being mentally exhausted. When <span class="posthilit">you</span> come home after <span class="posthilit">a</span> hard day's work, <span class="posthilit">you</span> can actually relax - and recovery time is short. I could never <span class="posthilit">do</span> that before, with mental stress - not really. But it seems now, some of my priorities/needs in life have changed since then. Going back to school and getting back into <span class="posthilit">a</span> technical field (or any specialized field), is <span class="posthilit">what</span> I need to <span class="posthilit">do</span> now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Luckily I've found <span class="posthilit">a</span> job in IT where I'm not on-call, and I don't take my work home with me. It's relatively stress-free. The only thing that really causes stress is the threat of being laid off when the company decides that to make more money this year, they'll cut down on payroll. But I suppose that's <span class="posthilit">a</span> possibility wherever <span class="posthilit">you</span> go (unless <span class="posthilit">you</span>'re self-employed).<br /><br />I plan on moving on to non-IT things some day. My plan has been to start venturing into those things on the side after my day job. Once I can start making money off of those things, and that income exceeds my regular job, I'll cut the wire, possibly. I've written <span class="posthilit">a</span> novel that is in the revision stages, and I'd like to get that done and see about publishing it. I don't expect <span class="posthilit">for</span> that to make more money than my day job, but <span class="posthilit">you</span> never know. There are other creative projects in the works that could be profitable, but are not even mostly complete.
