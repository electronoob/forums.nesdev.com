Crossover</a>. Previously I was using prerecorded sound effects, but it'd save a lot of memory if I can read sfx directly from nsf files in-game.
<br />
<br />A few games that I need nsfs with sound effects are Contra, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Blaster Master. Is there an easy way to do it, or would I have to figure out how to rip them myself? Thanks!

Somebody will surely provide more insight on this subject I am sure. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Many NSF files have been ASM hacked to include a track order.
<br />
<br />To find out what the first thing the NSF does, open it in FCEUX, Pause the emulator, Reset.  Open the debugger, press the Step Into button twice.
<br />
<br />For example, here's the Contra NSF:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">04:C3BE:AA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TAX<br />04:C3BF:BD C5 C3&nbsp; LDA $C3C5,X @ $C3C5 = #$26<br />04:C3C2:4C 9B 87&nbsp; JMP $879B<br /></div><br /><br />This code reads a replacement track number from a lookup table, located in memory at C3C5.  To get rid of that stuff, replace all those instructions with NOP instructions.  In this case, we can see all the hex values from FCEUX's debugger.<br />Grab a hex editor.  Change byte 0006 in the file to FF to unlock all 255 tracks.  Then look for the replacement track number code (AA BD C5 C3), and replace with NOP instructions (EA EA EA EA).<br /><br />I happen to have a copy of a Legend of Zelda NSF with sound effects.  It came from the defunct NSF repository at desnet.fobby.net.<br /><br />The Metroid NSF doesn't have sound effects, but the rip of the FDS version does.<br /><br />For Blaster Master, here's the track replacement code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">03:BFA0:AA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TAX<br />03:BFA1:BD B0 BF&nbsp; LDA $BFB0,X @ $BFB0 = #$54<br /></div>
<br />
<br />So look for AA BD B0 BF, and replace with EA EA EA EA.  (Also change byte 6 to FF)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />NSF file contains piece of 6502 code and data extracted from a NES game. In order to play NSF you need to emulate NES CPU and sound hardware. Flash is slow, so this takes noticeable amount of processing power.
<br />
<br />You can play NSF in an external tool that will emulate 6502 and record sound hardware register writes into a file. To play such a file in a Flash game you'll only need to emulate sound hardware but not 6502 CPU. This would reduce amount of processing power needed to play the sounds, and also exclude the ripped code/data from actual Flash game. This form of recording is comparable with NSF by packed size, much smaller than MP3.

But not all that much 6502 is actually executed, it's just the music playback code.  Usually under 32 scanlines worth of code or so.  Greatly dwarfed by the glue you need to stream sound to Flash.

<br />
<br />Anyway, I got all the sound effects I needed for the previous NSFs and I have them working in the game. There is one problem. The Metroid FDS NSF only has about half the sound effects from the game. Does anyone know how to get the rest of the sound effects for Metroid in NSF format?
<br />
<br />Also, I was trying to get sound effects for Mega Man 1 and Super C, but I didn't have any luck. Does anyone know how to get them? These are far less important than Metroid, but if anyone knows how to get them, it'd be helpful. 
<br />
<br />Thanks for the help.

<br />The Flash NSF player probably doesn't emulate the FDS sound channels, so about half of the sound effects will be missing.
