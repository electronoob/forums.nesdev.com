		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've replaced Snail Maze Game with 1007 Bolts because the former's maps are a direct copy of the maps in Sega's version, which could get us in legal trouble. <br /><br />RFK took one 32K slot and some CHR space in the unused portions of other games' slots, leaving us with 14 games, 2 toys, and four free 32K slots. That can change based on a couple things. For now I'm assuming that NovaSquirrel's FALSE interpreter won't push his app collection above the 16K that I've already allocated to SFX Editor. And Pong 198x could be re-added if <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=130484#p130484" class="postlink">its redesigned single-player mode</a> matures.

When the boot section is installed at reset*, and the app part as an menu activity, all the user has to do is start the activity to view the ram contents since reset.<br /><br />*: with chr ram bank switching, and erasing a magic string as well.

While gathering games to showcase for a play-through marathon, I may have found a few that could be included, but I realize that authors might be hard to contact. Filler like famitracker music, or a gallery of concept screen shots would work as well, considering there has been recently some very neat things posted in that area.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Today NovaSquirrel and I were recording a few gameplay videos to promote DA53. We managed to get a complete 5-round game of RHDE on DVD+RW. But during the process, we found problems with a few of the games. Currently Function and Sliding Blaster are failing lot check.<br /><br /><strong>Flicker</strong><br />Hardware showed a serious flicker problem with 1007 Bolts and Function that the more lenient FCEUX did not. It's as if the PPU update code doesn't finish on time.<br /><ul><li>In 1007 Bolts, once I got to the first speedup, the bolts flickered horribly. It turned out the OAM upload was at the end of the NMI handler, after all the game logic, instead of at the beginning. I moved it to the beginning, which fixed it. </li><li>The background in Function is &quot;bouncy&quot; in some CPU/PPU alignments, looking more like an Action 52 refugee at times. In FCEUX I noticed sprite 0 activity for some reason. It appears to be waiting for the end of vblank, busy-waiting about 16 more scanlines, and then enabling rendering. It also disables rendering early at Y=206, which causes known problems with OAM refresh. I'll try to get in touch with Denine. </li></ul><br /><strong>Report from Nova</strong><br />FALSE is out and Conway's Life is in. He's also given me clearance to drop his sound effect editor in favor of mine, though I'll have to patch out the battery support to get the builder to recognize it. He's made some minor improvements to Double Action Blaster Guys. But there's a crash bug related to pickups in Sliding Blaster that he's working on troubleshooting.
