<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I've always used [] for indirection.<br /></div><br /><br />Could this be because you started with assemblers like nesasm that have funky syntax?  I'm willing to bet that's why.  Which is another reason why I don't like nesasm for this:  it encourages people to fall into nonstandard practices.<br /><br />My first introduction to 6502 came when I made my first NSF player, and in all documentation I read, in other sources I checked, and debuggers and trace logs I examined... not once did I ever see any indication that [] was for indirection.<br /><br />This was my original point, actually.  You said that "most" assemblers use [] for indirection, yet so far you've only listed two.  I can list two that don't (ca65, x816) and can link you to countless other programs (debuggers, tracers, disassemblers) that don't, as well as page after page of documentation that don't.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Altough it's true that an assembler can detect if an expression is surrounded by () and have no math arround it it means indirection, but the leads confusion.<br /><br />[snip]<br /><br />lda (3*4+12),Y would be ambigus.

Most likely it's the second because there is no point in putting parenthesis, but well...<br /></div><br /><br />There's no perfect solution to this problem.  But this is a somewhat unrealistic and not really that confusing.  Nobody really encases <em>entire</em> expressions in parenthesis because there's no point (or at least, nobody should).  Like you say, math parenthesis here is useless.<br /><br />And this is the only way there could be this confusion.  Either parenthesis are totally useless, or they're indirection.  So the simple way to avoid this confusion is just to not have totally useless parenthesis.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Anyway I don't think either way makes that much difference.

Normal indirection () reads a 2 byte pointer, and long indirection [] reads a 3 byte pointer.<br /><br />Granted this isn't applicable to the NES.  But it enforces my point that () <em>is the standard</em>.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The only real consern that comes into situation when comparing assembler is their features, such details shouldn't bother anyone who is at leastt *a little* open minded.<br /></div><br /><br />There's a lot to be said for following standards.  And there's a lot of grief to be had for needlessly breaking them.  () is the standard for indirection pretty much everywhere in the 6502 universe.  For an assembler to stubbornly go against the standard for no real reason other than to avoid potential confusion is somewhat silly, and a big turnoff to me, personally.<br /><br />; is standard for comments<br />. is standard for assembler directives<br />() is standard for indirection<br /><br />Standards are a good thing.  Breaking them is bad.<br /><br />Can you imagine the flack a C compiler would get if it started breaking syntax standards like this?

I've always used [] for indirection. The () noation dates form the '70s, and that before common assembler had math pre-processor (I assume, I might be completely wrong).<br /><br />Altough it's true that an assembler can detect if an expression is surrounded by () and have no math arround it it means indirection, but the leads confusion.<br /><br />lda (3*4+12),X would mean using direct adressing (parenthesis are useless, but not an error)<br />lda (3*4+12),Y would be ambigus. Is it math parenthesis (useless) or indirection parenthesis ? Most likely it's the second because there is no point in putting parenthesis, but well...<br /><br />In WLA (and I guess NESasm too), it makes it clear in the doccumentation that () are for math and [] for indirection, but they can be optionally inverted.<br /><br />Anyway I don't think either way makes that much difference. A '[' it to a '(' what a 'Z' is to a 'z' if you see what I mean. The only real consern that comes into situation when comparing assembler is their features, such details shouldn't bother anyone who is at leastt *a little* open minded.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Jan 06, 2009 11:43 am</p><hr />

For compiling it'll be a never ending debate, as it seems no assembler has an ideal all-features list. CA65 has a ton of features but is complicated to use for newbie because it needs extra files for linking, so it WLA-DX.<br /><br />There is simpler assembler, but they may not have all features you'd want to have like align code, povisions for bankswitching code, relocatable code (copied to RAM before executed), have the same piece of code identical many times in the ROM so that it's immuned to bankswitching, etc...<br /><br />Personally I can tell WLA-DX is very good but it's annoying you have to type .w about almost every opcode who use 16-bit argument, and it doesn't really have provisions for relocatable code. Also, it's a shame you can not align RAM sections, only ROM section can get aligned for some reason. Aside of that it's a great assembler/linker. The author used to be active and to answer all question and bug reports, which was a very good thing, but that's not the case any longer. Finally if you switch to SNESdev, GBdev, or anything like that you can still use the corresponding WLA-DX which is cool.<br /><br />For making music everyone here will recommand Nerdtracker 2 which is an olg sluggish and terribly glitchy music tracker, and personally I recommand writing your own. I love writing music engines, and having to place music with .db statements is not as bad as using Nerdtracker's terrible interface.<br />There is other trackers arround, but personally I overall don't quite like trackers, that's too limited.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jan 05, 2009 3:52 am</p><hr />

For people in your situation (programming experience with something other than assembly) I usually recommend reading a lot about the 6502 until you get a grasp on how it works. <a href="http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/6502/index.html" class="postlink">This</a> is a good starting pint.<br /><br />While you study the 6502, you can use <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/michal_k/6502.html" class="postlink">Michal Kowalski's 6502 simulator</a> to code a few simple routines (such as multiplication and division) to make sure you understood things correctly and to study instructions don't yet understand completely. With this simulator you can study, among other things, how the flags work (flags can be confusing to newbies).<br /><br />Once you have a basic understanding of 6502 it's time to read about the NES. It's no use looking into that before you know some assembly because nothing will make sense. It is a good idea though to use an emulator with strong debugging features (such as FCEUXD) to study what the PPU can do. Abuse the tile/palette viewer and the name table viewer and observe how things change in response to input. That you can do before learning 6502.<br /><br />When you are ready, read all the NES docs you can find. The main NESDEV page and the wiki should have enough info. Once you haver an idea of how the PPU works, you can try using a good tutorial (hopefully someone can point one out!) and make your first demos.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Jan 03, 2009 4:17 pm</p><hr />
