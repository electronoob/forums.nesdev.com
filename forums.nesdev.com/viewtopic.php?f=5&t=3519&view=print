		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My SNES is braindead this morning.  I went to play some games on it, and I was welcomed with graphical glitch galore.  I went as far as to take the thing apart and reset the cartridge connector, even reversing it, but no change in behavior.
<br />
<br />Symptoms are as follows:
<br />Street Fighter II:  No title screen graphic, just a bunch of huge flickering pixels...  (as it tries to do the special effect, then the graphic disapears all together)..  Game itself still plays fine..
<br />
<br />The Lion King:  Background sometimes loses place, and just bounces back and forth horizontally, like it's forgetting where it's supposed to be..  Random freezes also occur.
<br />
<br />Super Mario World:  Game runs fine with only the oddity of the screen flashing brighter sometimes, only 1 frame out of 60 frames, and completely random.  Seems to only happen at the world map.
<br />
<br />Unless someone here knows what this means, I think my SNES is braindead, and is ready to die on me, which would stink, because this was a "rescued" SNES (previous owner trashed it very badly, he was a Sony fan...)
<br />
<br />I was going to get Castlevania, Dracula X for it, but I'm afraid that game wouldn't run at all, with all the graphical effects it does...
<br />
<br />Oh, and I did check the power supply..  Working fine..

<br />
<br />(I honestly don't know why the video stops playing audio..  on the DV disc, there was audio for the lion king example..  for some reason, it quit in the video file though..)
<br />
<br />1st Game:  Street Fighter II:  Title Screen
<br />2nd Game:  Don't know the name...
<br />3rd Game:  Lion King (notice the background is flickering)

<br />
<br />My guess is that some video RAM went bad. This is only a guess...
<br />
<br />Unfortunately its very hard to fix and you'll probably have to get another SNES off fleabay. You might call Big N, but they would probably want more to fix it than a used one off fleabay.

<br />Here's where it gets weird..  it ONLY happens to something that's getting Mode 7...

<br />
<br />Iggy is headless (which I assume is a fluke in this shot), but his moving platform is screwed up..  which, ironically, when it is straight, is shown completely fine..  it's ONLY when at an angle this happens..
<br />
<br />I have a feeling it's directly connected to Mode 7..
<br />
<br />More pics, incase you couldn't see the video..
