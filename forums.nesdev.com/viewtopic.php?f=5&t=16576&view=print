This is a relatively small community, and not a lot of people are online at any given time. Forum posts cast a much wider net for discussion than live chat, even though it's a slow way to communicate.

You will write about off-topic when you do not have a on-topic to mention, but when you do, then you can discuss the on-topics (and if someone is simultaneously discussing something else, those who are engaged in the on-topic conversation can ignore them if it isn't relevant to their discussion). (I personally have both on-topic and off-topic things to discuss on this IRC.)

On twitter I was not talking about NESDev or this particular Discord suggestion.<br /><br />I said here I'm not interested in joining an NESDev Discord channel, but the reason is entirely that this need is already being met by #NESDev.<br /><br />I do have (many) complaints about Discord but they're unrelated-- I am certainly willing to (and do) use Discord for chat channels that were already established there. There are differences between Discord and IRC, and I do prefer the latter, but they're both serviceable chat methods.<br /><br /><br />I'd much rather see #NESDev improved with new faces than have a new conversation fragment start up in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NESDEV/" class="postlink">some other corner</a>. I would grant that it's a relatively quiet place where people sometimes have off-topic conversations (why not, though?), but every time someone brings up actual relevant NESDev stuff the conversation <em>does</em> get going, and switches to that pretty quick.
