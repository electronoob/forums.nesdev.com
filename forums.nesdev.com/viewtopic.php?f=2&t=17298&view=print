Commercial companies made their own games from scratch, using entire teams of people, developing their own tools in the process.  These were all intellectual property; nobody at that time was making generic and free tools for making NES games.  Nintendo probably would have sued them anyway***.<br /><br />If you want to get into making NES games -- your several forum posts within very short periods of time, i.e. less than 24 hours, are indications that you do, but <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=217672#p217672" class="postlink">this is not very promising or open-minded</a> -- you're going to have to learn how the console works, and get started with assembly language.<br /><br />If you don't want to start with assembly language, but are more willing to learn something like C, you can try <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=17295" class="postlink">nes-starter-kit</a> which just got released a few days ago.  However, you are still going to have to learn assembly or deal with it in some way eventually -- there is no debugger for the NES (or NES emulators) that let you correlate lines of C code to actual 6502 assembly code.  So, you will need to learn some 6502 assembly either way.  For help with nes-starter-kit, talk to the author directly (or on GitHub Issues) in that thread.<br /><br />Please remember: you want to program games on a system made over 30 years ago... yet you don't want to learn anything from 30 years ago.  You're not being very realistic.  That's just my opinion though.<br /><br />*** - Tepples, if you reply to this sentence with some long legal diatribe speculating and pontificating, I will strangle you.  :P

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes: you can find a billion examples and tutorials and books on how to learn C and do things in it, plus learn on a different platform (ex. present-day PCs).  This is not the case with 65xx assembly.  If you think this forum is equivalent (ed. how did my spell checker turn that into equivocal? Hahaha) to that, then you are wrong.<br /><br />I shouldn't even have to mention the learning curve of learning and working on a console -- in any PL.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On the other hand, going for C first is prolonging the inevitable. Sooner or later, you have to touch assembly anyway. <br /><br />And even if you use neslib exclusively, you might end up scratching your head when it circumstantially scrambles your palettes with its fade in/out routine.<br /><br />I think using C makes a lot of sense if you’re already familiar with it, but if you’re new to either, starting with assembly isn’t too bad.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />IMHO, and from experience, starting with C is a good idea if you are of the kind (like me) who NEEDS results SOON. Also, writing your first game loop and game logic in a high level language is certainly easier if you are unexperienced. And then nothing stops you of digging deeper and learning the arcane. The 6502 is the easiest (for a human to read and write) assembly language I know.<br /><br />In really depends on your mindset and your background. I'm sure that most people who have coded in high level languages proficiently will find it easier to begin their first project in C. Just getting the grip with a new system with lots of stuff you must know and understand is already a daunting task.<br /><br />On topic, games don't write themselves, no matter if you have the best &quot;tool&quot;. From the OP's message about Family BASIC it seems he doesn't want to try very hard. And you have to if you want to make a game, specially for 8 bits systems. I'm in the process of finishing and releasing (need to write the docs) my open source, modular engine written in C which ideally anybody could use. It has everything you need to make your game, *but* you are *required* to understand the platform and learn quite a number of basics. <br /><br />There are no shorcuts, I'm afraid.

This also works with C projects, but it will work better with assembly projects (syntax highlighting, some minor issues, etc.): <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=215486#p215486">viewtopic.php?p=215486#p215486</a><!-- l --><br /><br />There's an option in the right-click context menu on the code that allows you to switch between disassembly &amp; source views (the option is only visible if a DBG file was loaded)
