There are two elements: technical things I've contributed, and the tone of posting I make. It's possible to contribute a lot but still be mean sometimes. I don't think technical contributions excuse being mean, no matter how much is contributed. People may think the tradeoff is worth it and excuse the latter so as not to lose the former, but that's strategic.

I try to avoid threads like this (as much as a big part of me doesn't want to), but I thought I'd drop by an state my piece.  Remember, I'm just one guy, so my vote/opinion/whatever should hold as much ground as anyone else.<br /><br />I don't have a problem with the way you communicate at all, blargg.  In fact, when you started making an appearance on the nesdev forum, I was delighted to see a new face that consisted of someone knowledgeable *and* wanted to share details in such a way that made sense to readers.  It also helps that your focal point was on NES audio, which is something a lot of people took a stab at without knowledge of waveforms and EE (myself included!).<br /><br />You take the time to explain things; this was one of my biggest irritations with the nesdev community (highly technical/knowledgeable people who would be as terse as possible, almost as if they were intentionally trying to piss you off).  So, I thank you for your time and your efforts here.<br /><br />Anyway, all that said...<br /><br />I think it's important that all of us take into consideration that we're all different.  What does that mean exactly?  This: we all have different personality or even mental quirks (OCD, ADD, Asperger's, forms of narcissism, etc.), we all think differently, we all react differently, and we all have different senses of humour (I, for example, will never understand tepples).  Diversity in mind, body, and soul is one of the things that makes us humans an amazing species.  Learning to communicate and "deal" with one another is part of any community effort (and is a big problem in open-source communities too).<br /><br />I mean, try to imagine a purely homogeneous nesdev community -- straight up Children of the Corn shit, let me tell you...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Sat Oct 09, 2010 8:51 pm</p><hr />

If someone is clearly out of his depth and yet ignoring advice to try simpler things first, he's basically just asking you to do things for him under the guise of him doing it. It's within his capability to go back to simpler things, but he's choosing not to. That sometimes annoys me. It's hard not to see that as selfish, wasteful behavior.<br /><br />I've no problem with someone who has attempted to understand and is asking for help, especially if he explains what his understanding is, so we know what to build on and so we can diagnose the shortcomings with current documentation. It's not basic questions that are annoying; it's questions that are due to not putting forth effort. See <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7025" class="postlink">a recent thread about NES initialization</a> for an example of good effort and the learner providing useful feedback so that those helping can see that they are indeed helping, and seeing what works/what can be improved.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Oct 09, 2010 3:35 pm</p><hr />

I would just like to say that not everyone in the world in an independent learner, some people have a much greater difficulty trying to learn from documents and need some help from others. This dose not mean they are stupid or less than those who can, its just each persons mind works in its own way.

<div class="quotetitle">blargg wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Again, one cannot merely just "lighten up", and it's a bit frustrating to be told to do that.<br /></div><br /><br />Okay, that's fair enough. It's kind of like telling someone who has been diagnosed with depression to lighten up; it's not that easy. However, the online environment is a bit different from face-to-face interactions. When you're around someone and you're in a bad mood, there are various things people can pick up from you where they can tell you're in a bad mood. It can be very hard to hide what you're feeling. But when posting online, you are making a choice, every time you hit a key on the keyboard, to communicate a certain message. Your mood doesn't have to be put in the mix. Even if you're feeling like crap, you can write a sentence that indicates otherwise (or a completely neutral sentence that has no emotion).<br /><br />With that said, I find when you are mixing in a negative tone, you are to some extent, going out of your way to mix it in; in other words, it's voluntary. If you're going to volunteer to write a post, you may as well volunteer to write a more positive post, than a negative post.<br /><br />Now, about people posting generic questions, and giving little information. I see where you're coming from with this. It is in a lot of cases, a reflection of one's selfishness to simply post "how do I do this?" or "can someone post code that does this?", but a lot of times it isn't. For example, when I first came here, I asked questions and provided very little additional information with what I was trying to do, simply because I didn't know what additional information was required. I thought there were simple, single answers to a lot of the questions I asked. Often, the answer I got was "what exactly are you trying to do?" or "there's more than one answer to that question; it depends on what you're doing." <br /><br />You need to first determine when exactly you are dealing with a user who doesn't know what additional information is required, and when you're dealing with someone who's just lazy, before you write something like "just f***ing google it".<br /> <br />I will fully admit, however, that I didn't at times listen to the responses given, and this isn't an acceptable behavior. Also, it might have had a lot to do with the fact that I was <em>way</em> in over my head; I had absolutely no clue what I was doing and I asked questions about things way beyond someone who doesn't even know how to code basic programs. In that aspect, any frustration with such users is completely understandable. The right thing to do with such users is probably to advise they start small, and learn more about programming in general before moving on to game programming. Unfortunately, a flaw of my character, impatience for working toward long-term goals, got in the way of me listening to such advise.<br /><br />What I find funny is that in that scenario, blargg was kind enough to contact me through email and offer to help me out, as well as answer additional questions I had. That, I found very respectable. I benefited a lot from that. And during that time, I didn't get any of this negative tone from blargg that I'm talking about right now. And actually, that's probably why I found our conversations so helpful.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Oct 07, 2010 11:04 pm</p><hr />
