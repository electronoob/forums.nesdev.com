<br />
<br />Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! (U) (PRG1) [!].nes/Punch-Out!! (U) [!].nes
<br />Playable, but graphical errors abound
<br />
<br />Low G Man - The Low Gravity Man (U) [!].nes
<br />Playable, but graphical garbage appears when you use the boomerang weapon and the boss level music gets garbled.
<br />
<br />Crystalis (U) [!].nes
<br />Graphics flickering when wandering around.
<br />
<br />Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II - The Arcade Game (U) [!].nes
<br />Graphic garbage usually flickers when new enemies come onto the screen.
<br />
<br />Little Nemo - The Dream Master (U) [!].nes
<br />Graphical garbage when conversing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It would also be helpful to figure out the mapper number of the specific rom file you are using.  There will be bad headers that could create problems.  Also then it will be easier to look up on the mapper table to see ones that are known buggy like MMC2 (iNES #9).  MMC4 most likely has the same chr bank switching problem.  Photos might be useful later if I can't get the problem to happen, but don't flood the thread with them yet.

<br />SMB/DH/TM is not and probably will require it's own config file just as a 4M MMC1 game would.

<br />but nestopia said those two 2 are mapper 1 so that is what I type I dont know it its correct or not
<br />
<br />this is something odd woth noteing
<br />"kirby's adventure (PRG0)" get a scrambled screen before the game genie screen but "kirby's adventure (PRG1)" works fine
<br />the PRG0 one has Ni0330 included in its headder and PRG1 dose not
<br />
<br />edit: made a small discovery if screen scrambles before GG/s-ram screen check the header for garbage data

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,  I got mine today but I seem to be having problems with ALL of my games.
<br />
<br />Many games don't load at all, and the ones that do are doing something REALLY weird. Any moving sprites (like Mario in SMB) are all messed up like only half is rendering properly.  Regular carts still work fine. I also tried loading everything onto a different CF card with no change. 
<br />One thing of note, all of my NES roms are from about 10 years ago in most cases. I wonder if that could make a difference? I guess I'll have to see if I can find some more recent copies if that's the case. 
<br />
<br />Any ideas?
<br />
<br />Thanks
