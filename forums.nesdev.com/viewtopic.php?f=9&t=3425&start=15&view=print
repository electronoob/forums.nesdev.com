<br />
<br />this is probubley true this diskman appaerintley was quite a busy guy sence I have run across quite a few of his dumps in my collection 
<br />
<br />allowing the power pack to ignore  garbage in the headers would be a posiple fix for this if possiple, 
<br />anouther possiple fix for this is a PC side tool witch can remove junk along with telling you about unsuported mappers this would make it easyer for the general public to use and cut down on this problem
<br />
<br />personally after getting into it my error reports will be less stupid in the future
<br />
<br />my tip's to people: if you get small black or white lines flutering over the screen reset the system and it should be ok, and if the game freezes before the game genie/battery screen check the header
<br />
<br />edit: duh goodnes can fix the headers with the fixnes command (proubley)
<br />

When the feature first appeared in v3.0, I heard a lot of bad things about it (not fixing some headers, breaking others).  I don't know how good v3.1 is, though.
<br />
<br />I still maintain that Nestopia's database is the best source for finding out what the header should be set to.  A utility based on that database would be really great in my opinion.  Anyone here willing to write it?  Nestopia is GPL.

<br />PowerPC or Intel?
<br />
<br />I could make a simple C program that takes the filename of an iNES file, checks if there is garbage in bytes 12-15, and if so, zero out bytes 7-15. That might solve at least a few problems, at least for [ACEFPSTU]?[A-Z]ROM games.

<br />
<br />A good suggestion, in this case you should use Nintendulator, which is as accurate as Nestopia.  Sometimes I feel that they are the same emulator, only one is geared for testing, the other for playing.

<br />Much better, the only glitchy part of either ROM is the training sequences between Circuits.  Those still show flickering and corrupt graphics on the lower portion of the screen.

<br />Thanks for the heads up. Implemented in my Anti-DiskDude tool. But it appears that a header "signature" that starts with H, I, J, K, X, Y, or Z will falsely trigger NES 2.0 mode.
