I even found software that would save in interleaved raw data from but never in 2 bits form. Any ideas? If I can't find anything, I'll code something that will take a .bmp with 4 colour bits but only 4 distinct colours and convert it into a .chr (interleaved 2 bitplane 8 pixel/2 byte graphics format). Does anybody know of any windows or DOS software that will import/draw and save to a 2 bit bitmap or a 2 bit colour interleaved RAW format? Thanks for any help.

<br /><a href="http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/nestc.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.nesstuff.kit.net/nestc.jpg</a>
<br />
<br />You have to change the extension from JPG to RAR, my server won't take RAR files so I had to rename the file.
<br />
<br />It is very simple, it is not an editing APP, it just does the conversion. I figured out it was a waste of time trying to write a nice image editing GUI, wich can be really hard, when there are nicer tools around. In my program you can only open a BMP, pick 4 colors from it and then convert to the NES format. There are some limitations, if I remember correctly, like the BMP file must have dimensions multiple of 8 pixels, since it will be converted to 8x8 tiles.
<br />
<br />tepples's program seems very nice. I'll check it out at home.

<br />Are you sure you used a 4-color indexed bitmap and that you specified <strong>-b nes</strong>? The proper command line looks like this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">bmp2tiles -b nes tst.bmp tst.chr</div>
<br />
<br />Oh, and "nestc" isn't really all that trustable, as a lot of sites used "nestc" as the file name for some obsolete emulator that I don't need to mention here.

<br />Tokumaru's programm is pretty cool, because you can still convert an image with more colors using more layers easily, by picking colors.
<br />
<br />Edit : The best by all, and the most usefull, would be to have a programm showing the list of all different colors used in the BMP file, and each one would be manually pointing to one of the four NES colours. So an image doesn't need previous conversions, anyone can easily design two or three layers/attributes aeras to allow more depht, and the thing is still done by hand, so you won't have bad result as in Tile Layer / Tile Molester.

<br />Yeah, sometimes I do that. Colors you don't pick turn into 0's, allowing for you to pick groups of colors separatelly. The problem is that you'll have to rename the image for that, as the program always saves the CHR with the same name as the BMP. The program is far from perfect, but for converting stuff for original games it works great. It is less complicated then most command line app's.
<br />
<br />In fact I wrote a command line DOS converter long before I wrote this one. It's the crappy bmp2nes that's on the nesdev page, when I used the name "q7h1460". That one only reads 8-bit BMP's and you must use the first 4 indexes. Not easy to get that right without complex image editing software. Since I draw most my stuff in mspaint, I needed another converter.

<br />
<br />I think I never heard of it. Seems pretty interesting. Is that all that's possible to do during HBlank? Change 1 palette entry and one attribute byte? What would be a practical use for changing the attribute byte? Wouldn't it be beter to change 2 or more palette entries? If they are consecutive, would it be possible to change a full palette (4 colors)?
<br />
<br />How does it work? After changing the stuff you have to set up $2005 and $2006 again? If we could change a full palette every scanline, that would kick ass!
<br />
<br />Has this been discussed before? Could you point me to that discussion? I vaguely remember that...
<br />
<br />I'd like to know more about this format... I'd be interested in writing a tool to convert to such a format, that allows the NES to show more beautifull images.
