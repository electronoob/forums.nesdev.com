		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />At one point in time I had two NES's because someone sent one for Christmas after I already had one.  On the older NES, the default screen color (seen when no game was loaded or during the few split-seconds before a game drew the title screen) was light blue.  On the newer NES, the screen color was pinkish (don't remember exactly how it looked - that NES kicked the bucket years ago and we threw it out).  Strangely, Legend of Zelda got a different result - during the second or so it takes to boot, the older NES would flash two or three different colors on the screen before the title screen.  I haven't found any emulators that show this, and I don't remember it ever happening when starting LOZ with a Game Genie (which blackens the screen before starting the game, and no colors showed up before the title screen).  To this day I've wondered what it was about LOZ that caused the NES to show multiple screen colors during the bootup phase.  None of the colors matched the background color of the title screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Right, the point of initializing the palette to particular values is in case a game expects certain values. Someone could do the work of checking this by modifying an emulator to log whenever the first access to a particular palette entry is a read rather than a write.
<br />
<br />The color shown at power-up is presumably determined only by the value in the first palette entry, so it would be only one modification. But being an emulator, the accuracy of the simulation doesn't need to be compromised. An emulator can make a special case in graphic rendering and treat the first palette entry as black until unless it's been written since power-up.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It would be stupid for any game to rely on the initial palettes values. Final Fantasy seems to rely on an initial value into ram for pseudo-random encounder, but after all, the encounters are supposed to be random, so no problem here. Read the initial palette to seed a random number generator would be pretty stupid, I think.
<br />I just noted than some games, such as Dragon Warrior 3 and Hanjuku Hero does a palette fade-out in the reset routine. It's pretty fun, because the screen is supposed to be totally off at that time. However, maybe it is not the case on a real nes (?) and it could fade out the screen if the reset button would be pushed (?) I have no DW3 card, so if someone could confirm this with more detail it would be cool.
<br />So I don't know if the games reads the palette from the PPU or from a RAM buffer to do the fade-out at the begining. If it is from ram, gabarage may be written to the palette at power up, but it would do a nice fade out at reset (not power up), if bg and sprites are still turned on via $2001 trough the whole reset routine (but I suppose that gabarage would be seen when the PPU is reseted for two frame, else waiting two frames would make no sense, right ?). Anyway, the screen is off when the reset button is down, so I think it isn't that overall.

<br />
<br />Yes it would, but when programming, especially in assembly language, sometimes code unintentionally depends on obscure aspects of hardware. If these aspects are stable, it might not get caught in testing. The point of writing an emulator to be as accurate as possible is to handle cases like these.
<br />
<br />When coding for the NES, one should rely on hardware details only where there is significant benefit. About the only use of this kind of information when programming for the NES is when trying to understand exactly why some code isn't working.

<br />If you hit the reset button to do a soft reset, the screen might not be off, especially if you're playing on a Famicom where the CPU reset button doesn't affect the PPU at all.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My devcart has CHR RAM (Zelda modified to always have the SRAM switched in at $E000), so I load the ASCII tiles there when printing the result code on screen. But I'm pretty sure none of the tests even access the CHR area, just the code that prints the result. Since it also makes audible beeps, they'll probably be usable with CHR ROM.
