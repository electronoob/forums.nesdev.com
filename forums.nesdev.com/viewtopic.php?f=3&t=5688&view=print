		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Whan a channel is halted, the length counter is supposedly set to 0. The waveform counter itself is also halted from what I recall (so no sound output). What happens to the audio channels when they are re-enabled? If LC is enabled, is it reset to the original value written to it or does it take the last counter value used before being forced to 0, or does it just still remain at 0 until something other reg write enables it. The question for volume envelope (being it looping to decay) and also for sweep.
<br />
<br /> So basically, can $4015 be used to retrigger notes or to pause/unpause notes?
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />Tom

<br />
<br />If it's any help for reference I could re-upload the source my NES sound emulator for SNES.  The length counters and everything clocked at 60hz is on the 65c816, but the sweeps, linear counter, etc. are in SPC asm and rely on the SPC timers.  Not that it's perfect emulation, but it's very close (only 1 or 2 NSFs play wrong, but most of them don't use the hardware effects and stuff anyways).

But yeah it's like Bregalad said, a lot of stuff takes effect when those upper registers for each channel are changed.</div><br /><br /> I saw that mentioned in a few docs, but nothing about the rest of the channels.<br /><br /> Instead of making a bunch of threads, maybe I should just keep asking questions in this thread (and re-title it)?<br /><br /> The triangle channel is driving me a bit nuts too:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">--------------<br />Linear Counter<br />--------------<br /><br />The Linear Counter serves as a second more-accurate duration counter for the<br />triangle channel. It contains a counter and an internal halt flag.<br /><br />Register $4008 contains a control flag and reload value:<br /><br />    crrr rrrr   control flag, reload value<br /><br />Note that the bit position for the control flag is also mapped to a flag in the<br />Length Counter.<br /><br />When register $400B is written to, the halt flag is set.<br /><br />When clocked by the frame sequencer, the following actions occur in order:<br /><br />    1) If halt flag is set, set counter to reload value, otherwise if counter<br />is non-zero, decrement it.<br /><br />    2) If control flag is clear, clear halt flag.</div>
<br />
<br /> When $400b is written to, the halt flag is set!? What halt flag is it referring to? Is is the halt flag in $4015? Also, why don't some of these docs include the values of the control bits; like bit #8 1=disable blah : 0=enable such and such. It's driving me made.
<br />
<br /> So my question is for the triangle channel. There's a linear counter and there's a length counter (pulled from the table). At what point is what enabled/used?
<br />
<br /> If bit #8 of $4008 is set, then I take the lower 7 bits and use then as literal/linear counter (and the linear counter used 240hz clock include if the 120hz clock of the length counter decrementer).
<br />
<br /> So what happens if Bit #8 is clear? The lower 7bits are ignored and the channels doesn't become active until I write a new value to reg $400b in which the upper 5bits are the index into the length counter? Then the channels goes active?

<br />Feel free to upload it I'd be interested in looking at it. Also it definitely needs a few fixes, as it doesn't always sounds like the original, especially if you don't disable guassian filtering (which can't be disabled on real HW).

<br />I put it in here, 2a03-src.zip.  main.asm and spc.asm are the interesting parts.  Currently I'm uploading the binaries too so it'll finally have an actual distribution point.  I never put it on the Parodius server because of the filesize and the hundreds of copyright issues. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey it would be great to modify it as a NSF-&gt;SPC converter so you could litsen it as simple .spc
<br />Also I now understand why it did work with so few of my works : The SNES CPU runs the code "as-it" without any emulation, and the host programm overwrites some zeropage locations. It would have been better (but much slower) to write a true emulator here.
<br />
<br />In the end the sound would be much better if a lower sample was used for square so it doesn't sound so muffled, and if a sample would be used for noise instead of noise.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The main thing to make it work, in the original question of the thread too, was just keeping track of when the registers are written.  You'd keep a copy of $4003 for example, and compare it to the old one, but also do something to the original location so you can tell when the same value is written repeatedly (even zeros).  I'm not sure how I handled it at the moment, but it's in that source.

But there were some problems, a real common thing was an emulated JMP ($0000), using the wrong page.  I hacked the NSFs, when I probably could've just rearranged the memory pages originally.  A few NSFs were filled with things like STA $0024 and were a lost cause on hacking.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It would have been better (but much slower) to write a true emulator here.</div>
<br />
<br />On the SPC700 you mean?  It was pretty similar to the 6502, that'd be interesting.  I'm sure it'd be fast enough, for almost any play routines.  I don't see a big advantage over using the emulation mode of the SNES CPU, since NSFs don't use undocumented opcodes normally (if ever).
<br />
<br />You're definitely right about the sound samples, I'm sure it would sound better with a lower sample.  Originally I was thinking that the entire output was being filtered, but if it's gonna change with a different playback rate then it'll make a huge difference.
<br />
<br />I could have done the looped noise thing, but it was just laziness at that point since hardly anything used it (heh, but the intro screen music uses it).
