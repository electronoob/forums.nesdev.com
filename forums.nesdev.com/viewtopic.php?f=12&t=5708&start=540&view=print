For an exhaustive list of changes and fixes, check the link in my signature.<br /><br />Note that the in-system flashing procedure takes a bit longer than previously due to one more bank being written.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, guys. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />So, what about the future of the SNES PowerPak software?<br /><br />Well ... Once again, I recently wrote to bunnyboy concerning a few important things (e.g., I wonder what more could be done with an only &quot;60% full&quot; FPGA?), but haven't gotten a reply yet. In the meantime, I've reviewed my progress so far, gotten better by reading more tracelogs (of FF6j, mainly), and contemplated the possibilites for maxing out the PowerPak's potential.<br /><br />First and foremost, I've come to the conclusion that my PowerPak firmware as of now is nice to look at, and works well. And that it needs heavy improvement, at the same time. The reasons why I feel compelled to do it are manifold. If I don't do it, who will? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Joking apart, I've been a fan of the PowerPak ever since it was announced in late 2009, and even though there are other flash carts for the SNES available, I feel I love my PowerPak more each day. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />To cut a long story short: Yes, there will be an unofficial firmware v3.00. It's been in the works for two weeks now, and it's coming along nicely.<br /><br /><br />Emulator shot:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/v3_mufasa/mufasa_WIP_131130.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />TV shot:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.manuloewe.de/snestuff/powerpak/v3_mufasa/mufasa_WIP_131130_TV.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />Major new (i.e., WIP) features are:<br /><br /><ul><li>Full theme support, replacing the restricted logo/BG selection (at least one theme will be distributed along with the first &quot;MUFASA&quot; release).</li><li>No more CF module accumulation, the concept of which has been obsolete ever since the appearance of my in-system flasher anyway. Been working on this very hard lately, it's actually much more of a pain in the neck than it may seem.</li><li>A sprite-based, palette-switchable 8x8 VWF font for errors, special messages, etc.</li><li>Auto-SRM creation (planned); this will only happen once I fully understand how FAT cluster chains work.</li></ul><br />Are you still with me? ... That's great. Long live the SNES PowerPak! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I understand, FAT cluster chains are not that hard.  When a FAT-using system loads a file, it does the following:<br /><br />1. Get first cluster number from directory entry.<br />2. Read cluster.<br />3. End of file?  Yes, stop.  No, continue.<br />4. Read entry of FAT that corresponds to current cluster number (i.e. cluster 0x02 uses entry 0x02).<br />5. Entry set to end-of-chain (0x0FFFFFF8-0x0FFFFFFF for FAT 32)?  Yes, stop.  No, continue.<br />6. Entry set to free cluster (0)?  Yes, assume end-of-chain and stop.  No, continue.<br />7. Use value found at entry as next cluster number.  Return to step 2.

There are a few other differences, but that's the big one.

In C, that would usually be measured in bytes, but in the FAT it's measured in clusters. (Often, linked lists also contain a data element in addition to a pointer to next element, but in the case of FAT, the address is the data)<br /><br />So, if the 40th-60th 32-bit words in your FAT32 volume (or 16-bit words in your FAT16 volume, or 12-bit words in a FAT12 volume) were all 0, and your cluster size was 4 KiB, and you wanted to make a 32KiB uncleared file, you'd write something like<br />41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, …FFF<br />to the 40th through 47th words of both copies of the FAT. Then, in the directory you were inserting the file, you'd insert a directory entry with FirstCluster = 40.<br />The sectors haven't been cleared yet, though, so you might want to write 32768 bytes of all 0 to flash first. (Or maybe not, maybe that'll be handled transparently when you write out the SRM from the game)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But after that is the hard (and probably patented) part: creating entries for the file in the directory and its long name and possibly allocating another cluster for the directory entry.<br /></div>You <em>might</em> be able to claim non-infringing use by copy-pasting the original name verbatim, and updating the last 3 bytes/ucs2 of the shortname and LFN.<br />IIRC, the patent was only on making available a linked shortname-longname pair, so <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/07/vfat-linux-patch-could-circumvent-microsofts-patent-claims/" class="postlink">workarounds</a> exist. (Although one does need to ask whether non-VFAT compatibility is needed)<br />Also, you should seriously ask if you need to care; Microsoft doesn't seem interested in suing people unless they can get meaningful licensing fees.
