The last time I read the spec as amended, there were three files: prg, chr (optional), and board. Games licensed by Nintendo would omit the board file; instead, they'd be looked up in the ZapFC database based on hashes of prg and chr. The board file was added in an amendment as a concession to allow unlicensed games, homebrew, and pirate-originals.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Thu May 17, 2012 5:02 pm</p><hr />

v088 and earlier allow loading of iNES 1.0 games as .nes files.<br /><br />v089 and above will only load images in the FC spec:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Super Mario Bros.fc/<br />* program.rom &#40;Super Mario Bros.nes sans first 16-bytes&#41;<br />* manifest.xml<br />    &lt;cartridge&gt;<br />      &lt;board type=&quot;NES-NROM-256&quot;/&gt;<br />      &lt;mirror mode=&quot;vertical&quot;/&gt;<br />    &lt;/cartridge&gt;<br />* save.ram &#40;not for SMB, but for other games.&#41;</div><br /><br />In v088 there is a tool called purify, that when run on the command line, will turn a collection of NES (or ZIP) files into folders, and generate the manifest files for you.<br /><br />By v090, we're hoping to have a launcher so you can associate your .nes/.zip file with it to have it launch in bsnes.<br /><br />I can't call the XML markup spec finalized until I support many more NES mappers, however, so use it now at your own risk.<br /><br />My format is fundamentally incompatible with what FitzRoy was attempting to do, and I don't have support for his spec.

With your advice, and hours of digging through the bsnes source code I figured that I need to:<br />1. create a folder named "blargg_nes_cpu_test5.fc"<br />2. copy the .nes file into said directory<br />3. chop the 16 byte header off<br />4. rename the file to "program.rom"<br />5. create a "manifest.xml" with the following content:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&lt;cartridge&gt;<br />   &lt;board&gt;<br />      &lt;type&gt;NES-NROM-256&lt;/type&gt;<br />   &lt;/board&gt;<br />&lt;/cartridge&gt;<br /></div><br /><br />After which, bsnes segfault'd running the program - it fails to load the reset vector from $FFFC.

The NES, on the other hand, can't boot over the controller port (yet), and not nearly as many people know how to solder up a CopyNES, so people with a sizable collection of NES Game Paks are more likely to torrent a "GoodNES set" instead of dumping their own. Perhaps a Game Genie with its ROM replaced with <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6941" class="postlink">standardized boot code</a> might help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Mar 07, 2011 2:43 pm</p><hr />

sorry for gluing replies to different people, but I'm at the airport and I'm a bit in hurry<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">panzeroceania wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />ultimately though I don't think this is aimed at the end user primarily, but more at dumpers, devs, etc. and having end users use it would just be a bonus that gives devs an additional reason to work with it.<br /></div><br /><br />well, most end users do not know what iNES is at all. they would not care if they have to download a .nes file, a .fc.zip file or a zipfile containing separate prg/chr as long as the emulator they use work with that file. <br />you are right that no one is trying to completely drop iNES, but for sure there seems to be a lot of resistance to the idea of adding to emulator support for a xml or zapfc database in addition to iNES<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Wkter wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />From looking at this thread again, what I see is missing is not a new format, but rather tools that can work with the information already there. ZapFC doesn't offer anything that isn't already there (iNES + BootGod's database).<br /></div><br /><br />except that BootGod's database is not complete. <br />MESS xml adds info for all the remaining official and pirate dumps (including Dipswitches for pirate carts), but it still lacks some of the items of BG's db (I'm working into adding these as well, but it will take some time)<br /><br />and both these xmls databases would not be of help if someone does not want to add an xml parser to its emu. in the latter case, ZapFC is a viable solution to offer an easier-to-parse internal database<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">xamenus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />ZapFC is good for people who don't want the cartridge info bundled with their ROMs. Is there any other format that offers that?<br /><br />Not that I necessarily would use the format myself. The No-Intro team might like it.<br /></div><br /><br />I'm missing something (and the difficulty in reading the db in a text editor does not help at all): is there only the checksum of PRG+CHR? or also the separate ones?<br /><br />if the former, then I don't see how the format can allow for separate prg/chr handling. and if this is not supported then the format fails to really document the content of a NES cart: at that point, I don't see how it is superior to the current nointro dat which supports the CRC32 + SHA1 of the iNES files without an header.<br />I thought the whole reason to add a new format was to better document the real carts, not to only use a larger checksum algo.<br /><br />if the latter, otoh, then we are back to my previous comment: ZapFC can be a useful internal database for whoever does not want to parse xml in its emu<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Zepper wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">xamenus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">ZapFC is good for people who don't want the cartridge info bundled with their ROMs. Is there any other format that offers that?<br /></div><br /><br />- UNIF?</div><br /><br />nope. unif contains a global header + a shorter header for each chunk of data.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1627">etabeta</a> — Sun Mar 06, 2011 12:41 am</p><hr />
