<br />
<br /><strong>Date:</strong> March 24 &amp; 25, 2012
<br />Some festivities begin Friday, March 23
<br />
<br /><strong>Where:</strong> Sheraton Milwaukee Brookfield Hotel in Wisconsin
<br />
<br /><strong>Tickets:</strong> $25 for Saturday &amp; Sunday  (Found here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/tickets/">http://www.midwestgamingclassic.com/tickets/</a><!-- m --> )
<br />
<br /><strong>What's New So Far:</strong>
<br /><ul><li>If you pre-order your tickets, certain areas will be available to you 30 minutes prior to the general public on Saturday, March 24.</li><li>There are several ticket packages available this year including one that takes a Friday road trip to local collector Tom Taylor's impressive 300+ unit in-home arcade.  </li><li>There are now two Friday night tournaments: the original Friday Night Clock Chaos tournament for pinball and a new, console video game tournament in the museum called the Friday Night Up to Par tournament. Details will be forthcoming.</li></ul><br /><strong>What's Stayed the Same:</strong><br /><ul><li>We held the line again on ticket prices which is pretty impressive when you consider we've done this now for the last several years despite our own costs climbing.</li><li>Similarly, the Sheraton room rates are also remaining the same at $89 a night.  Every regular room was sold out at this rate this last show.</li></ul>
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if we announced it here post MGC 2011, but the MGC recorded more than 5,000 visitors for the first time ever over the two-day event!  A big <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to all of you here that helped make that possible!  I really enjoyed the NES projects you brought with this year!
<br />
<br />I believe Dan is already working with some of you on an event for MGC 2012 so I will leave it at that for now.
<br />
<br />For more information about the show, you can visit <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.midwestgamingclassic.com">www.midwestgamingclassic.com</a><!-- w --> or our new official blog at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mgcindepth.com">www.mgcindepth.com</a><!-- w -->
<br />
<br />Later.

<br />I've spoken with Dan about the area and I was under the impression that it was moving forward again.  He's probably trying to figure out how the whole Community Hall area will fit this year before contacting you about the extent of the area.
<br />
<br />Later.

If you guys are going to be demoing homebrew and such, I'd be interested in giving you guys a copy of boom to have available for playing. Well, a ROM, but I assume there'll be flash carts there. Just PM me if you would want to.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, we'll have probably 3 systems.  There are several home-brewers attending and we'll be demoing our games, and each other's stuff.  I'd be happy to drop your ROM image on my powerpak.  If you can't make it, I'll talk about your game for you and hand out flyers / game instructions, etc...
<br />
<br />The MGC is fast approaching.  Please don't want until the last minute to contact us, especially if you need table space and can provide your own system.  We have room for one or two more systems, depending on the size of your TV/LCD and how large of a TV big_jt brings for his own system.
<br />
<br />NES homebrewers' exhibit will be in the same room as last time.  We'll be sharing the room with an exhibit from Nintendo Age and a console modding group.  Ben Heck will be in a different room this year.
<br />
<br />From what I know, the following regulars from nesdev will be attending for sure:
<br />
<br /><ul>* clueless (me!) (Yars' Revenge clone)<br />* Memblers (Garage Cart, other cart work)<br />* Big_JT (Assimilate)<br />* Rizz (Armed for Battle)<br />* Marshallh + Ryan (N64drive)<br /></ul>
<br />
<br />I think that Tepples and Nova will make it, with their games and the Action 53 project.  If Tepples cannot make it, we'll demo Action 53 for him.  Tepples?
<br />
<br />I live very near the Hotel where the MGC is held.  I plan on taking Friday before the MGC off from work.  I'd like to gather any homebrewers up for a dinner and social evening on Friday.    Big_jt needs to eat some more flaming cheese!
<br />
<br />We're going to have a blast.  If any of you can make it, please do so!

<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />It uses mapper 34 (oversize BNROM) with vertical mirroring. I have 512 KiB and 256 KiB versions; both work on a PowerPak. The smaller version just doesn't have NES15 and Pogo Cats. One of the games requires a Zapper (no, it's not Panesian Power; it's a lot more E-rated than that) and can work with two Zappers. Will anyone be bringing Zappers?
