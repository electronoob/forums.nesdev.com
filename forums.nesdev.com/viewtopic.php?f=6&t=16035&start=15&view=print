As long as the entry is not advertised and the name is withheld, in most cases this is enough to serve its purpose. If you go out of your way to identify instruments and engines to guess the author and base your score on it, that's on you and you should feel bad for it. I'm just trying to protect the innocent from their own unconscious bias.

Wouldn't it be better to spend those bits on the audible portion of the spectrum?<br /><br />This whole MP3 vs Opus argument is missing the point, anyway.

One may support one format but not another. iOS supports ALAC but not FLAC. (However, it's been reported that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15747518/apple-flac-lossless-audio-compressed-alac-ios-11" class="postlink">iOS 11 may support FLAC</a>.)<br /><br />It would be something to allow uncompressed WAV file submissions for freestyle as devices generally support that.
