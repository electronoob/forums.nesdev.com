Then the future arrows become &quot;just&quot; split scroll of the background...

This is what it would actually look like on the NES, since the waiters are three tiles wide and Nick is two + one, so 12 sprites.  4 of them would have to be dropped off for at least a single frame, while another set of four would be dropped off for the very next frame.

It would perhaps look a little odd but with some clever redesign of the graphics I think it could look good enough. That would remove the flicker.<br /><br />*edit* I did a <strong>very</strong> quick mockup of how I would imagine them looking if they were shrunk down. It's ugly and the proportions are bad but I hope it will get the idea across. <br /><br /><img src="http://driar.se/pic/nes/waiter.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />*edit2* Couldn't keep my hands away, did another quick update to the waiter.<br /><br /><img src="http://driar.se/pic/nes/waiter2.png" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />An easier way to prevent flicker would be to prevent a whole plethora of enemies being on screen at once; if you play the game, you will see that it likes to throw 5+ enemies in a given time, especially in a row.  If you only had two waiters instead of three in a line, there'd be minimal flicker.<br /><br />I also noticed that I could use color $22 as the main BG color, since the game's graphics seem to imply that.  Later I might come up with a different, and hopefully more accurate mockup.<br /><br />Edit:  Here's the alternate version of the mockup I promised a few minutes back.  While it looks more accurate, I am not a fan how how the columns have a lot of black, overpowering lines.<br /><br />Question regarding the NES' NTSC and PAL video output.  PAL regions can show 240 vertical pixels, while NTSC regions can show 224.  Does that mean the NES automatically cuts off the uppermost and lowermost line of graphics for NTSC, or is it more complicated than that?<br /><br /><img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/ndvebm.png" alt="Image" />
