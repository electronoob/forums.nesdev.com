<br />Whenever the PPU isn't rendering, such as between one frame and the next or when the screen has been blanked, the CPU can replace chunks of data in the CHR RAM. The wiki has a <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CHR-ROM_vs_CHR-RAM" class="postlink">page explaining CHR RAM</a> if you're curious.

<br />In theory you could read it with a programmer, I don't think it's very common for them to have mask ROM algorithms though.
<br />
<br />Data is probably not scrambled/"swizzled" (this is not a function of a mapper). If it is, you could always reverse it by tracing the pins back to the cart edge (mapper pins might be a little ambiguous) and asking someone to deswizzle it.
<br />
<br />One thing to point out though is that this game is probably already dumped.... It's mapper 42: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nocash.emubase.de/everynes.htm#mapper42fdsportmariobaby">http://nocash.emubase.de/everynes.htm#m ... tmariobaby</a><!-- m -->

<br />
<br />99.99999% sure the signal source will be one of the 74LS00 built into a 1-bit multiplexer so that's where to focus your attention. It looks like the lower right one but not entirely clear from the solder side traces. Remember it's <strong>VRAM</strong> A10, not A10 to the CHR RAM. Pin 18 of the FC cart connector.
<br />
<br />If the 7400 (multiplexer) checks out, move back to the 7474 (one FF will be the mirroring register), if the 7474 checks out move back to the 139 (decodes the register).

As for the game being dumped already, I couldn't find anything except for the mapper information on kevin horton page. I guess I'll try to check again on the good nes list or something as I wouldn't want to waste energy on something that would have already been dumped. Does Kevin has the habit of dumping the pirate cart he's working with?
<br />
<br />As for the cart, I'll keep fiddling with it, I hate seing a good cart going to waste. I tought I had found the issue when I noticed one of the solder point and trace around a chip legs lifted from the pcb but sadly it wasn't the cause of the mirroring issue.

<br />
<br />The whole point of mapper reverse engineering is of course to dump the ROM (usually without removing said ROM from the PCB, though in very rare cases I have removed and dumped a ROM... usually to confirm some theory or whatnot).  Then I usually write a mapper document so that it can be emulated.  I always use copynes for this, so that means there is usually a mapper plugin for it also to dump the cartridge without having to take it apart or desolder anything.
<br />
<br />Anyways, you asked in an email about what kind of ROM it is.  I'm pretty sure it's a 28 pin, 128K byte ROM chip.  This will not be easily dumpable using an EPROM programmer unless it supports dumping these kinds of ROM.  My EPROM programmer (ancient thing) has a setting called "23C1024 MASK ROM - dump only" which allows it to dump these ROMs.
<br />
<br />They have the same pinout as a 27512, except /OE is turned into A16.  This means they only have a single enable in the usual place where /CE is on a 27512.  A0-A15 and D0-D7 all are on the same pins as on a 27512.
<br />
<br />one way to dump them is to gently bend A16 (pin 22) out a bit so it doesn't go into the programmer socket, then solder a wire from that to ground (pin 14)  dump as a 27512,  then move the wire from ground to VCC (pin 28) and dump it again.  This will give you two 64K dumps.  put them together (A16 grounded + A16 at VCC) to form a single 128K ROM.

<br />I was gonna suggest this, but I though the idea was too crazy. I'm glad to see someone with actual hardware knowledge saying this.
<br />
<br />I guess that if you don't want to bend any pins you can put a socket between the chip and the programmer, and bend the socket instead of the chip.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That’s a very cool work around Kevin, thanks for the information, this pretty much answer my question! As for the game being dumped, I'll have to look further because I couldn't find a mention about it online. If you did dump it, I don't see the point on doing it again if not as a learning experience: D I got to say, this board is full of very knowledgeable and helpful people. Sometime I wonder where all of you nintendo genius work at during the day and if the experience you got from those nintendo project give you some kind of edge in your field.
<br />
<br />Edit: Ok, I guess I found it on goodnes.db, I wonder why people are not trying to make repro with that ROM instead seeing as it only require a couple of TTL logic chip. I'm confused because I saw that thenesdump.com are doing a repro using mapper 5 and I didn't think it would be possible to make repro using an american cart for a game that was using VRC 4.

But here where it get weirder, I didn't have time to get too excited before noticing the scrolling issue come back once I use the build it level selector! But if I progress normally to the second stage for example everything is ok. I switch to level 2 with level selector and bam, mirroring issue again. I'm baffled.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hehe I decided to do probably what many people were thinking and just quit it, I wouldn't feel good selling it since it seem to be working and then not working and I figured no pirate cart is worth that much trouble (specially not for the high bid of 71$ I got for it). I wasted too much time trying (and more importantly, wasted yours!) to get it to work, we almost managed to fix it but it's not 100% so I would feel dishonest to sell it. The game is fun but at this price people can easily get a repro. I'll desolder everything and maybe use the cart to learn a bit like try to copy the pcb in eagle and make it accept 32 pin eprom and who know, maybe try to reproduce the mapper on a CPLD as a learning project. I just wanted to thanks you all for all the help, it was very much appreciated and I managed to learn alot just by reading all your answer and fiddling with it and that's probably worth 70$!
<br />
<br />Rest in peace venerable pirate Japanese cart! You fought well till the end!
