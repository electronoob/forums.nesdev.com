		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First of all this is more along the lines of a "thought experiment" then actually suggestion this be implemented. But assuming we already have some kind of ddr pad for nes (powerpad? Anyway that's besides the issue). Wouldnt it be possible to make a cart that hooks up to an mp3 player. Now the idea is that the left channel of the songs on the mp3 player contain a mono version of the song you want to play. Now the right channel would have the actual arrow data implemented. Similair to how data used to be stored on casettes. The only thing I can't completely think up is how you would time everything as the arrow has to scroll up of course after its been told to been drawn by the mp3 player signal...but that might lead to irregular timing...any thoughts on that?
<br />
<br />
<br />edit: for clarity the data would be mixed in similair to how famicom extra audio works.

You'd need a big ROM, but it'd be all self contained, and much more realistic to be made. And there's many types of MP3 players, so you'd need a different game per MP3 player. And that'd be insane to do.

<br />I just re-watched the video, I guess it does play sound, but I swear I saw one before where a MP3 was played over it...oh well. My bad I guess?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Moero Pro Yakyuu (Japanese version of Bases Loaded) has a sound chip where the Famicom feeds it a track number and then it starts decoding audio. Back in the day, the memories on such chips were only big enough for sound effects, but nowadays they could probably be used for music. This would work on a Famicom or a modded NES.
<br />
<br />To play on a stock NES, the samples would have to get fed to the NES APU. I can think of one efficient way for a mapper to make decoded audio available to the NES, though I haven't tried it. Have the mapper put a sample value from $01 to $7F on the data bus when the address bus equals $4011 and R/W is high, and raise an IRQ. Then the IRQ handler would do this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">irq_handler:<br />&nbsp; dec $4011&nbsp; ; read from cartridge, subtract 1, and write back to APU<br />&nbsp; rti</div>
<br />I <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7424" class="postlink">originally thought up these methods</a> in the context of ROM-hacking games to play MP3 music (e.g. ripped from Brawl or OCRemix or sequels or the like) instead of the built-in music.
<br />
<br />But I can think of two more problems you'll run into with the rhythm game genre: <ul><li>Konami, Harmonix, Activision, and other companies hold broad patents on rhythm game concepts. Unless you also hold patents they want, they might not be willing to cross-license. </li><li>The major record labels might not be willing to license recordings to you. </li></ul>

<br />I don't know how to explain this properly. What I mean is there's a point at which stuff starts to be "non NES-like" enough that I wouldn't even bother trying to make it for NES. Also need for an external MP3 player adds to that, I'd rather see this self contained. But to each his own. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

The game's entire soundtrack encoded with 32 kbps Vorbis would fit in about 20 MB. I've seen microSD cards 100 times that size for $2 on Google Product Search.
<br />
<br />Besides, if you just want to make DDR, you don't even need mapper sound; you can just have someone cover the songs in Famitracker or something. You may have already heard what I've done to <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/dwi/NES-Butterfly.ogg" class="postlink">Butterfly</a> and <a href="http://pics.pineight.com/dwi/NES-Maxx%20Unlimited.ogg" class="postlink">Maxx Unlimited</a>.

<br />At first I didn't believe it and thought it was running on some kind of enhanced famiclone but then I found the dump in my pirate folder and tried it on nes EMU and sure enough, it ran.
