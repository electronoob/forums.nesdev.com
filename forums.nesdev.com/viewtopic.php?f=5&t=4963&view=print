		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm looking for surface mount replacement batteries for replacing the batteries in Game Boy games as well as NES and SNES (and maybe some Genesis) games.  The type needed is CR2025 for GB and CR2032 for consoles and they need to have surface mount solder tabs.  Does anyone know of a good place to buy them from that is reliable, inexpensive, and has near identical to OEM sizes/shapes?  Digikey has a similar battery, but its called a "BR2032" and the mah rating is lower, meaning the life would probably be shorter.  They also have a CR2032, but the tabs are a vertical mount and I couldn't bend them like I need to.  Don't recommend me other methods like battery seats, soldering wires to normal batteries, or cutting the tabs off of the old battery, those methods take too long and are too finicky for the volume I'm going to be doing (well, except the seat, which is too difficult to find in a size that will fit).
<br />
<br />What I'm looking for basically looks like this:

<br />
<br />and if you're wondering why I don't buy that one, its because its a CR2016 and if it worked at all, it wouldn't last for shit.

<br />Also, don't dismiss the speed of soldering the old leads to a new battery. Once it's hot, a solder gun can make quick work of the metal, and it makes a good connection. As a novice of the better part of 5 or 6 practical uses of soldering guns(spanning ~5 years), I can still make decent use of one. Last time was days ago to redo the 3-wire connection for a set of headphones. With that sort of metal, you can heat the top to melt it to(or from) a glob on the bottom with far less risk than you'd have with a circuit board.

<br />$2 a battery (roughly) which is more of what I was looking for vs. the obscene $9 a piece on eBay.  CR2032 batteries do in fact fit/work in gameboy games, right?

<br />If so, you can get them for less than a buck a pop if you get more than 20.

You can solder to a battery, you just have to flux it first.  Also, batteries have a little bit of a coating on them so it helps to first scratch the surface with a piece of sandpaper and then clean it with alcohol before you flux to ensure the best connection.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MetalSlime wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Would this work?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/LBAT-50/3V-LITHIUM-COIN-CELL-W/-SOLDER-TABS/1.html" class="postlink">http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/LBAT-50/3V-LITHIUM-COIN-CELL-W/-SOLDER-TABS/1.html</a><br /><br />If so, you can get them for less than a buck a pop if you get more than 20.</div>
<br />
<br />no, I can't bend the tabs how I need them, it sucks too as the vertical style is more common and cheaper for no legitimate reason.

<br />With standard horizontal clips they usually fit if you bend one. You may need to "pop" one or two of the "bolts" to get them to warp that far though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />And if you attach wires, you can use any battery holder that will fit in the cartridge. I bought a lot of really cheap holders off ebay a while ago. I don't remember exactly but I think they were like 20 cents each.
<br />
<br />. I just use some double sided tape to attach it to the inside plastic of the cartridge. Then I solder wires to the circuit board. In my opinion it's easier and cheaper since, since cr2032 in bulk are pretty cheap. You can also just snip off the old battery since you don't need to unsolder the tabs..
