Emulators could then access the sound data directly instead of relying on WAV playback and external files.

We could have the ADPCM files directly in the NES ROM to be accessible by the $7000-7FFF register.<br /><br />Regarding an NSF, I thought it would be kind of cute if we decapped and dumped the three chips that we could make NSFs given the existing samples in a special JF+D7765C NSF driver. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I know we would have to specify another expansion chip number, but it would be in the same vein and &quot;accurate.&quot; Also, I think the Japanese would have fun making their own songs with these samples as well. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Edit:  I've made a few more implications regarding the music composition area in the <a href="http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?id=3931" class="postlink">FamiTracker forums</a>.

Currently, it specifies that the ADPCM samples are only available in ROM (although this ROM needs not be mapped to the CPU), and cannot be RAM. DotFami does require the audio data to be included in the ROM area of the .fami file.<br /><br />For UNIF, you could add an extra chunk for this audio data, and for NES 2.0, I don't know.

We know all of the recorded sounds are 5, 6, or 8kHz 9-bit audio that can be compacted into (most likely) 3 bits per sample. As a result, given a 96kHz 16-bit recording, possibly after having underclocked the IC in the first place, we should be able to figure out the original compression specifics and generate the original 3 bit data stream.

Sounds like taking an MP3 at a specific bitrate, decoding to WAV, then encoding it back to the same bitrate again.<br /><br />I know The Guru does IC decapping but his list is seriously backed up for what he wants to accomplish.  I may consider your option.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MP3 round-tripping is complicated by the fact that MP3 uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_discrete_cosine_transform" class="postlink">overlapping blocks</a> for its cosine transform, causing rounding errors to propagate to samples in the previous and next blocks. ADPCM, on the other hand, is a simple deterministic algorithm, and rounding errors propagate no further than the next sample. Even JPEG can be decompressed and recompressed, as rounding errors don't propagate outside one 16x16 pixel macroblock.

More akin to &quot;given a WAV of a MIDI, reconstruct the original MIDI&quot; than MP3.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It would be relatively easy to support in NSF software players. For something like PowerPak it might be out of the question due to the additional ROM requirement.<br /><br />If you can successfully reverse engineer the ADPCM format, I'd be willing to support it in NSFPlay. (I'm not really interested in supporting a list-of-WAV-files kinda thing.) There is room for another expansion bit in NSF, and it would be easy to put the data at the end of the ROM area.<br /><br />Some reasons not to bother, maybe:<br /><br />1. None of these games used the samples for music.<br />2. The samples seemed to be overpoweringly loud.<br />3. When ported to the NES, these games used DPCM or PCM samples (haven't checked which).<br />4. Custom samples in hardware is going to be very difficult to accomplish.<br /><br />Those reasons don't really matter to me, but not knowing the ADPCM format does.

There probably isn't a need to decap the chip itself (unless you wanna).
