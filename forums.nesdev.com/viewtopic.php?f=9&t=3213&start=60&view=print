Never had a problem.<br /><br />I know the  NWC cart uses the Reset line for something critical that other carts don't use...were you confusing it with that?</div>
<br />
<br />Possible.  I know that at 1990 tourney several NES decks were all connected together.  Maybe that was how it's used and not needed for single player mode?
<br />
<br />Either way if it works, great.  I haven't played that one since I was at Detroit tourney March 1990.

<br />
<br />why would it be nessaserry to wire to the cart slot, is there a reason simpley soldering  wires to the pins and useing a programmer cant work?
<br />
<br />it would not be overley difficult for me to pull the chip or maybe cut  a few of the traces and repair them when done but I cannot see why that would be nessasery, I know bunnyboy said boot rom reprogramming would probubley be unnessasery but I still want to be able to. If its "held in read mode" like this "leonk" said then I do not see how the GG would be able to screw it up the onley thing the way I see it witch could be held in ground to disable wrights would be WE but that would be unnessery and I do not see why this would be done

<br />As far as the GG, I'd assume register mapping/bootrom conflicts would be the reason that it wouldn't work, but I've never looked at the tech behind the GG much beyond what it does.

<br />I'm pretty sure you're just being cute, but no, I'm talking about an ETF in bonds I hold with my stockbroker.  BTW not to get way off topic here but if anyone wants more details, just PM me. You get very respectable returns without volatility and risk. If you have been socking away funds in CDs this is a good alternative to that. You should be able to buy shares with any broker.

<br />You probably just copy the files to the CF card. If you don't have one, a device that makes them accessible on the PC shouldn't be expensive at all. I'm sure there are some cheap card readers that read many types of cards and plugs into your USB port.
