How long, exactly, does it take?  How long, exactly, do you think it should take?  The reality is I probably won't be able to meet your expectation but your report that it is taking too long is probably not ungrounded, so I am trying to understand where we're at.<br /><br />As for going back to MFC.  No.  I am trying to be helpful to others beyond &quot;just run my shit in Wine, yo&quot;.  I do have a special place in my heart for MFC.

Good work on the &quot;Go Button&quot;!<br /><br />I think the reason I got confused with my first attempt with NESICIDE is that I didn't realize the way to open a simple hello world project was to just create a project under that template.  That and I spent a lot of time clicking around on your site looking for the download not realizing it was here. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />You sure do have all kinds of bells and whistles on this thing cpow.  I knew you had a lot going on with your IDE, but wowzers there's hardly nothing that you're unable to monitor and/or visualize.  Great work on this project, the debugging capabilities you've got here are truly unparalleled.<br /><br />So is it about time to reward yourself for the hardwork on this project and get some use with it to create a game of your own??? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Tue Dec 10, 2013 10:43 pm</p><hr />

Stability fixes to address crashes on app exit or project closure.  Most turned out to be related to shutting down threads handling debuggers.<br />2. Fix for choppy 'farting' audio caused by inclusion of FT in NESICIDE and inappropriate SDL buffer sizing.<br /><strong>3. Inclusion of qbradq's uc65 tool and a NROM template project for it, accessible via Project-&gt;New Project.  Create, build, run, and debug step/breakpoint through your UC65 project.</strong><br />4. Fixed focus problem on Ctrl+Shift+F - now focuses in search text entry field so you can start typing text to search for immediately as you'd expect to be able to.<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn't get to the enhancement requests yet [palette picker, open with...]<br /><br />As usual, bug reports, enhancement requests, always welcome.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3705">cpow</a> — Tue Dec 10, 2013 3:11 pm</p><hr />
