It definitely is a vague question. But for certain your level of experience is going to drastically impact how long it takes you. And then how much time per day you have to work on it.<br /><br />When I wrote my first emulator it took probably a week to go from nothing to something that could play some games. The slowest part in the beginning is writing that CPU core. It's also probably the biggest barrier to someone getting started. When you're working on emulating the CPU there is no really satisfying feedback. You are just looking at your debugger or logger executing instructions. Things are far more interesting and rewarding once you can see something happening. <br /><br />Once you've written an emulator for NES you could certainly crank one out in a day that would play alot of games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Jun 23, 2014 11:19 am</p><hr />

&gt; How long did it take you (and everyone else here) to make your first ever emulator? 1 day sounds pretty insane.<br /><br />I started with the SNES, and it took a few weeks to get some interesting demo games running, and around a month or two to get the first commercial game fully playable. For a long time I didn't emulate the APU, so I was patching out the APU wait loops in various titles for a while. I put a lot of emphasis on the debugger right away, so that probably stalled me a bit in getting stuff running, but helped later on.<br /><br />And it actually only took me half a day to get Super Mario Bros fully playable. I'm sure it was because I emulated the SNES first, and it's very much like a substantially souped up NES in design. Still it was somewhat disappointing how easy all of the 'tough' problems like sprite-zero hit and MMC5 turned out to be.<br /><br />The only real issue with the NES is the way the insane amount of mappers wears me down. I haven't yet found a way to organize all of that code nicely. Mapper#s are a bad system because the same board can use multiple #s. Board serials are a bad system because some boards lack serials. Lots of board variations exist that use the same MMC chip, but act somewhat differently in certain areas, and it's messy whether you combine or separate the logic for those.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Fri Jun 20, 2014 10:53 am</p><hr />

[requires your own hardware research]<br /><br />By your own research, I mean you need to write your own tests and run them on the real thing to figure out how stuff works, because you won't find it all in documentation.<br /><br />If you plug in other peoples' code (like blargg's SNES DSP, or an existing ARM CPU core), you can drastically reduce the above times, but what's the point of writing an emulator if you're not actually writing it?<br /><br />Documentation levels:<br />NES = best-in-class, very low-level timing information readily available.<br />GB = absolutely atrocious. Most documentation is from the '90s. Writing a great GB emulator would be much easier if someone would document it.<br />GBA = somewhat decent. But not much on low-level stuff like ROM prefetch operation, hardware quirks, etc.<br />SNES = very good. Research up to 2008 or so is available. Died off after anomie left.<br /><br />The SNES and GBA PPUs are leagues beyond the NES and GB/C PPUs. Still doable, but the complexity goes way, way up. Without copying an existing implementation, the SNES sound core is the hardest to deal with, but the easiest to &quot;perfect&quot; (since it's mostly digital.)<br /><br />The SNES SuperFX, SA-1 and ST018 each make the NES MMC5 look like child's play, so keep that in mind if you think NES mappers are hard.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Thu Jun 12, 2014 11:55 pm</p><hr />

Game Boy Color's PPU can flip background tiles, place background tiles in front of sprites, pull each tile from one of two pages of CHR RAM, and color each tile with one of several sets of four colors. Its CPU can run at double speed, and it has general-purpose DMA to match the &quot;Blast Processing&quot; in Sega's Nomad system as well as CHR HDMA to load dozens of tiles per frame.<br /></div><br />Wow, there goes my motivation... well, not really, although that does sound painful to figure out.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />As for how complicated the Z80 instruction set is?

Not general purpose DMA, just DMA targeted only at VRAM.<br /><br />As for how complicated the Z80 instruction set is?
