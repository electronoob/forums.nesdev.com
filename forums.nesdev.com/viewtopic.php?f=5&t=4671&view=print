<br />I am affiliated with this guy who is nine years old. 
<br />I suppose he's a type of step brother.
<br />
<br />There's more to him than that.
<br />This guy has high interest in homebrew and electronic development.
<br />He is a fan of Memblers's work 
<br />And enjoys Chris Covell's "Solar Wars".
<br />He's played griploads of Homebrew games and demos.
<br />
<br />Plus he plays "Kart Fighter" and the other mari games by ConySoft, although I don't know if I'd call that homebrew. (What should I call it?)
<br />
<br />His name is Josh. He is interested in Learning the 6502 assembly language, AND C++.
<br />He might have what it takes. You know that "Gamemaker" thing by Mark Overmars? I know It's know it's not like assembly or C++ or anything too big but I let him use it and he is pretty good with it.
<br />
<br />What do you guys think? 
<br />He's thinking about registering an account here. He won't be annoying like that <strong>JARGON</strong> fellow neither.

Programming is cool and all but it can't bring you happyness its not a good idea to get too involved with it at such a young age when you should be developing social skills.
<br />
<br />Knowing how to interact with others will take you farther in life than any practical knowledge if you donâ€™t learn it when your young,  if you can't make are cultures backward ways second nature you  will always be limited.

<br />Because I <em>am</em> annoying at times. <a href="http://forum.gbadev.org/viewtopic.php?t=13608" class="postlink">In this thread, forum.gbadev.org regulars air their grievances</a>.
<br />
<br />But otherwise: What a coincidence! I have a cousin named Joshua who uses Game Maker and wants to learn C and 6502 asm, but he's older than 9.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />PPU attributes aren't <em>that</em> hard, but I will admit they're a bitch. They're easy enough to understand conceptually, but dealing with them is a huge task. I remember when I was first writing my universal scrolling engine that I had the biggest headache after a while of coding attribute updates. The problem lies in updating 2x2 chunks where there's that #$@#%@# attribute on bottom that's only 2x1 2x2 blocks and all the others are 2x2 2x2 blocks. It's a big headache to deal with.
<br />
<br />It doesn't necessarily require <em>advanced</em> 6502 knowledge, hell I don't think I even have advanced knowledge. I'd say I'm like mid-advanced. There are lots of things I don't fully understand (e.g. working with signed numbers, certain little quirks, etc.). Luckily like I said I made a universal scrolling engine that I can just drag and drop into pretty much any game I make, and never have to worry about attributes again.

<br />Yeah, or you'll end up like me  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> .
<br />
<br />No seriously, I didn't get out enough when I was young; I had a fairly large addiction to video games. But that's probably because I lived in the smallest town ever with nothing to do (though I did go outside and play), but I'm not here to tell my life story. So anyways, yes, what Peppers said.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That is really cool.  A 9 year old who's interested enough could learn more and probably faster than anyone here.  There is the newbie forum which I originally intended for anyone who's just new to programming and everything (I've remember showing a lot of people how to use a command prompt) - natural stuff for a lot of us, but no one was born knowing it.
<br />
<br />As far as not being a cave dweller, it seems every programmer says that (I remember reading an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto where he said the same thing, that was long before I started programming).  Having no social life isn't a requirement, but I can see how it would help!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> 
<br />
<br />It takes time to write a game, but it's a lot more rewarding to create a game rather than play through dozens of them.  Games, music, technology, learning in general is what I was interested in, so for me it was a matter of doing something constructive with my time (intending to have something to show for it, in the end).
