<br />
<br />Power Blade 2 has a major problem here: the status bat "follows" a certain sprite, so it keeps going up, down... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />In short words, could someone clarify the A12 timing during a frame?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's how it works as I understand it:
<br />
<br />If background patterns are at $0000 and sprite patterns are at $1000, PA12 will rise eight times, at x=260, 268, ..., 316. It is believed that the MMC3's scanline counter ignores rising edges closer than <em>x</em> dots apart (conjectured to be about 12), so the counter is clocked only once. But if 8x16 pixel sprites are used, PA12 will skip a rising edge if the least significant bit of attribute 1 (the tile number) is false because patterns are read from $0000-$0FFF instead of $1000-$1FFF. This creates a delay of 16 dots between rising edges, which is greater than <em>x</em> and therefore clocks the counter again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I guess instead of making my own thread about this, I'll simply post my question here. I am almost done with MMC3, all of blargg's test pass (except revision A, because I haven't tried yet <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />). Yet in at least 3 games there are some issues.
<br />
<br />- Mega Man 5
<br />  - Boss 'intro' screen shakes on the bottom half of the bar (The part with their name on it).
<br />
<br />- Mega Man 6
<br />  - Knight Man's stage, the floor shakes at the part with the spikes that move down on top of you
<br />  - Centaur Man's stage, the floor shakes at the trippy part where the water is suspended above you
<br />
<br />- Rad Racer 2
<br />  - There are sometimes small glitches on the left side of the road
<br />
<br />I can't figure out where this is coming from, the PPU passes all the VBL Timing (Doesn't pass sprite overflow timing tests which /may/ be connected, but highly unlikely since A12 only depends on fetches made), and the MMC3 IRQ Timing tests. So whence cometh the shake? It's making me want to pull out my hair, because aside from these small bugs, every game that uses MMC3 looks perfect.. Here is my code for clocking the IRQ Counter, which also may be wrong:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; private void PPU_AddressLineUpdating&#40;int addr&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oldA12 = newA12;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; newA12 = addr &amp; 0x1000;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if &#40;oldA12 &lt; newA12&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if &#40;timer &gt; 16&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if &#40;irqCounter == 0 || irqReload&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; irqReload = false;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; irqCounter = irqRefresh;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; irqCounter--;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if &#40;irqCounter == 0 &amp;&amp; irqEnabled&#41;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#123;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cpu.IrqRequest = true;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; timer = 0;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#125;</div>
<br />
<br />the variable names should be obvious, but just in-case they aren't:
<br />
<br />- timer: this is increased along with each dot on the PPU
<br />- irqCounter: the value that is decreased on each rising edge of A12
<br />- irqRefresh: the value written into $C000
<br />- irqReload: set on writes to $C001
<br />- irqEnabled: set on writes to $E001, cleared on writes to $E000
<br />
<br />CPU Timing passes all test, PPU timing passes all relevant tests, MMC3 passes all tests. So yeah, I don't get why I'm having /ANY/ problems, but I am. Any suggestions?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll assume that "timer" ticks up every cycle no matter what...
<br />So we have a check if A12 went to zero, checks if it had already happened within 16 cycles, then happens IMMEDIATELY otherwise.  So far so good.
<br />But I'm a tad concerned about the cpu.IrqRequest flag.  There are at least 3 IRQ sources (APU Frame IRQ, DMC IRQ, and Mapper IRQs), how are you telling them apart?
<br />
<br />The Mapper IRQ flag stays on until the game clears it with a mapper write.  The CPU has its own interrupt disabling bit.  The interrupt triggers whenever the CPU hasn't disabled interrupts and while the mapper requests it.  They can retrigger if the game never clears the interrupt flag on the mapper.
<br />
<br />Are you passing the CLI latency test?  Should have a lag of 1 instruction between CLI/PLP/RTI and the interrupt happening.
<br />
<br />A dumb mistake that I recently fixed was that PLP/RTI instructions weren't checking for interrupts afterwards properly  (weren't checking at all in my case).  Other dumb mistakes I've made resulted in Frame IRQs becoming enabled after loading state, so it looks like infinite MMC3 IRQ triggering as the game draws its status bar 100 times, but it's really frame IRQs staying on because the game isn't trying to clear them.
<br />
<br />
<br />Other stuff:
<br />You time a PPU write at the END of the last CPU cycle.  So if you are at pixel #240 when the write starts, you are 12 pixels later at #252 by the time the write finishes (on NTSC).  Y scroll change happens at pixel #251.  So you get shaky stuff if your PPU pixel is sometimes before #240 before the second $2006 write, and sometimes after pixel #240.
<br />
<br />I just checked Megaman 5 in FCEUX.  It completes the second $2006 write within a range of pixel #275-285, well past the shaky range.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tried getting the CLI latency test to pass, but all my 'fixes' started looking really hack-ish so I decided to wait, do you really think that could be the problem here? How do you handle it?
<br />
<br />I guess there should be a way to tell different interrupts apart from the other, it always seemed weird to me to use one flag, but it's worked just fine until now. The DMC constantly asserts the IrqRequest flag until it's acknowledged, but the FrameIrq and mapper irq's don't. So I guess this is a problem <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />
<br />
<br />MMC3 has got to be one of the biggest pains in my rump to implement, all other mappers so far took between 15-30 minutes. This has taken 2-3 days already.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I should also point out that I have a cycle accurate PPU, that does all the appropriate fetches and passes timing tests including the "odd frame" shortening test, sprite 0 hit tests, and vbl timing tests.

<br />My emulator doesn't differentiate between different IRQ sources.  Technically, it's wrong, but I haven't found this to cause problems with any games.

<br />This is beginning to look more and more like a timing issue in the PPU to me. I ran a few more NMI and VBL tests and some didn't pass, so I think this might be one of the (if not the only) causes.
