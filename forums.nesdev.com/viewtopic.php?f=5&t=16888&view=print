		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll share mine. I absolutely hate FPS games, I probably wouldn't care too much if they weren't everywhere, but they are. I just find the whole concept of &quot;Run around and shoot things&quot; dull and uninspired. Okay, now I'd understand if the genre was created as a tech demo in the late 80s or early 90s to show off 3d, and nothing more, but the market has been flooded with these games, and so much to the point where the Video Game stereotype is violent shooter game with blood edgefest. This stereotype is so widely believed that ignorant parents believe all Video Games are violent and don't let their kids play Video Games at all despite the fact that there is such a thing as a non-violent video game. The overall concept of an FPS game itself is nothing more then tech demo worthy, maybe an indie game at best. <br /><br />On the other hand, my favorite genre is platformers. They don't try to be too much, they're family friendly, and they're overall just fun. They provide the perfect amount of challenge, when you die, it's the players fault. I mainly like Mario and Sonic. of course, to be honest, I'll bet that the main reason I don't like FPS games, or really any modern games for that matter, is that they're too realistic. They're all too dark and gloomy, just look up Video Game screenshots and you'll see. I honestly find myself much more attached to brightly colored, cartoony games, because they pop out more.

I can't possibly understand how anyone can see the insanely repetitive task that is fighting the same enemies over and over (using menus, instead of proper character control!) just to &quot;level up&quot; as a fun thing to do. Back when the GB Pokemon games were big and emulation started to become popular, I often saw friends speeding up every single fight, so they obviously didn't find the fighting any more fun than I did, so why play a game if you feel like you have to fast forward most of it because it isn't fun? I don't get it.<br /><br />Here are some of the things I dislike in games: realism, repetition, text, tutorials, waiting, menus. RPGs have a lot of those things, as do modern FPSs, so it's no surprise that they're my least favorite.<br /><br />As for my favorite genre, it's definitely platformers, retro and modern. The more cartoony, the better.

As for the RPG fighting, that's just flat out tedious, I mean, imagine playing Space Invaders, but every time you shot an alien, you had to go through an RPG like battle sequence.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the subject in the original question to too general. <br /><br />In my opinion you can take any genre and do making something cool and unique with it. I'm speaking from a game designers point of view here. It's not that the genre itself is boring, but maybe the developers failed to do something interesting with that said genre. <br /><br />Here are some games from different genres that I personally like. <br /><br /><br />Racing: Super Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing<br /><br />Fighters: Street Fighter 2, Garou Mark of the Wolf<br /><br />Puzzle: Bubble Bobble, Tetris<br /><br />First Person Shooter: Goldeneye, Halo<br /><br />Shooter: Cosmo Gang the Video<br /><br />RPG: Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana<br /><br />Action Adventure RPG: Zelda 3<br /><br />Real Time Strategy: Populus PC version from Bullfrog <br /><br /><br />I feel like I could design a cool game for any genre. If you are a developer, why not pick your least favorite genre and then code a really interesting game in that genre that you actually like. Then all of a sudden, its not your least favorite genre anymore!
