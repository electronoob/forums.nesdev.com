<br />
<br />Nah, there's three squares there in the middle portion of the screen (up and down), so you stay out of the shallowest half-screen water when you're in the middle.

<br />Ninja Gaiden was okay, a bit too fast paced sometimes, and having some straightforward tips.
<br />I can't comment on the Jaws tips. I've never played that game, and after watching that video, I'll have to conclude that not playing it wasn't a bad idea <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Anyway, I just saw the Double Dragon video - I did <strong>not</strong> know about that score-building tip on Mission 2; I always kicked people in the first stage &amp; backed off to let them recover &amp; repeated that over &amp; over (took way too long).

<br />By the way, that shadow is your brother, Jimmy. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />I can't believe you did one on Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde!  I thought I &amp; that guy who wrote that FAQ were the only ones with the patience to beat that game.

<br />
<br />There's a couple others up there now, Castlevania and Karnov.  The CV one doesn't really have too many tips that most people already know honestly... I think.  I thought about covering the short-cuts you can take by taking damage, but ended up not doing that.  In retrospect I probably should've.  Oh well.
