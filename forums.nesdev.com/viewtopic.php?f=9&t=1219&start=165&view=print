<br />
<br />You are exactly right.  The carry flags get SET going into every bit, which does  (operand A XOR operand B) XOR (carry)
<br />
<br />Which has the effect of XNOR. 
<br />
<br />I will update my documentation to match.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, I have a disassembly now, although it doesn't look necessary anymore since someone can reproduce the bitstream with an emulator.  I'll trace through the code to see what the algorithm is - I suspect the international versions use the same algorithm but a different seed.
<br />
<br />The code from $00-19 initializes most (but not all) of the lower half of RAM.  The code from $1A-26 obtains the 4-bit init code from the master.  Next, $27-34 finishes initialization of the lower half of RAM.  When that is done, the contents of this half of RAM is copied to the upper half ($35-41), which is then patched to obtain the final init state ($42-4C).  When all is said and done, the contents of RAM look like this:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$00-0F: x s 9 5 2 1 2 9 F 9 1 0 D F 9 7<br />$10-1F: x 3 9 5 2 F 2 0 F 9 1 0 9 9 9 7</div>
<br />The x's above ($00 and $10) appear to be temp storage and not part of the current pseudorandom seed.  The value at $01 (s) is related to (but not equal to) to 4-bit seed value sent by the master.  To calculate s, do the following:
<br />
<br />1. Assume s0, s1, s2, and s3 are the 4 bits sent by the master, in transmission order.
<br />2. The value s is equal to 2 + (s0*8) + (s1*1) + (s2*2) + (s3*4).
<br />
<br />In the lagged stream, s2 and s3 are set, so s = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
<br />
<br />During transmission, the contents of $07 determines the number of bits sent each way.  Subtract this number from 8 (mod 16 of course) to determine the number of bits to transfer.  A value of zero is equivalent to a value of 15 (although the chip burns two extra instruction cycles when this happens).  The master sends data corresponding to the upper half of RAM ($11-1F), with the Tengen chip sending the lower half ($01-0F).  The LSB of each nybble is transmitted only.  When fewer than 15 bits are sent, the first nybbles are skipped and the ones at the end are transmitted.  Bits are sent in the same order they appear in RAM.
<br />
<br />Since $07 starts out set to 9, all 15 nybbles are used in the first transmission ((8 - 9) % 16 == 15).

<br />
<br />I wouldn't think DMCA applies, the CIC isn't protecting any kind of copyrighted work at all.  It simply stops the NES from resetting every second, and that's all it does (annoying little bastard that it is).

Has to be perfectly synchronized (so a clock source other than the 4Mhz available is out of the question), and the PIC is like the Tengen chip in that it takes 4 clocks per instruction (and some of those Tengen instructions do quite a bit at once).  Also on the PIC some instructions (like GOTO and branches) take more than 4 clocks.  I imagine it's timed code all the way through.  So it'll have to be less of a translation and more of a careful rewrite.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And then can we use the info to make an attack on 10NES itself so that we can understand what differs among the NES regions and between the NES and Super NES?</div>
<br />
<br />SNES CIC seems to have completely different code, so it's not likely gonna help with that.
<br />
<br />Hopefully the NES regions only changed the seed, I guess we'll know once we know the full algorithm.

<br />
<br />Using the PLL in a PIC might also be an option, if that won't put the PIC totally out of phase with the CIC.
<br />
<br />Even though I'm not very tepples-like when it comes to patents and copyrights, I'd also like a discussion on legal issues. Consider this articles for instance: <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20051111/boyd_01.shtml" class="postlink">http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20051111/boyd_01.shtml</a>
<br />
<br /><em>"The case involved Nintendo suing Atari for copyright and patent infringement of its “10NES” cartridge authentication system. This system is used by the NES to discern the difference between licensed and unlicensed cartridges. <strong>The Federal Circuit upheld a judgment in favor of Nintendo based on the copyright analysis alone. This copyright is still valid and will be for about eighty more years.</strong> This is also true for other Nintendo copyright registrations associated with the NES."</em>
<br />
<br />In a worst case scenario, a PIC-replica made by <strong>anyone</strong> who has viewed the info resulting from reverse-engineering might be considered infringing, simply because the reverse-engineering was performed on a product which was considered infringing.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, I have a feeling that finding someone who can claim to have reverse-engineered the CIC without having viewed the soon-to-be-publicly available docs won't be entirely impossible in the near future, should it be necessary to enter such legal loopholes.
<br />
<br />I am all but an expert on legal issues, so I'd like to hear people's opinions on this. Though maybe we oughta split into another thread for such a discussion...
