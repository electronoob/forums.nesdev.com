<br />The last time I tried using 32KB bankswitching I had a lot of repeated code... Like, every bank that had level map data also had routines for decoding rows and columns from it and for testing collision detection, so that I could just select the bank and perform the task I wanted, as opposed to bankswitching a ridiculous amount of times just to read the data and perform the tasks in another bank.

This would probably only be useful if you had the extra 8k of SRAM so you could copy larger pieces to it. But if you have only the 2k to work with (actually 1.75k, pretty much), then chances are you could squeeze any code you'd copy into the fixed bank.
<br />
<br />This is why I really like 8k bankswitching. You still have a fixed bank, but you can swap out more than one bank. This is really handy for something like my cutscene engine with large rendering code in one bank, and large screen definitions in another. This code is so large that it can't fit into a 16k fixed bank and leave space for other code, and it also is very crucial that everything within that code is executed at the highest speed possible. The code also accesses the data in that bank really often, and the data chunks are often around 256 or more bytes. Copying that to RAM would take a long time as well as a lot of space in RAM. So if I couldn't bankswitch more than one bank and I didn't want to copy data to RAM, I would have to waste A LOT of cycles jumping back and forth between a data bank and a code bank.

<br />
<br />I think it's a good idea, I mean today the SRAM only costs about ~$1, and I'm sure one could easily spend more than that on a fancy mapper alone.  And gameplay-wise you can generally <em>do more</em> with the RAM than the mapper.  With my Squeedo design I figured I could get away with 32kB PRG-ROM paging largely for that reason - there are 4 8kB pages of PRG-RAM that can be banked independently, which is more than enough room for code and variables.
<br />
<br />The vectors don't really matter when you consider that a mapper init routine can fit in probably 8 bytes per bank (load, store, JMP), and that you can point the NMI and IRQ vectors to SRAM.
