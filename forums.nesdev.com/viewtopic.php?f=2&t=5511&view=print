<br />
<br />I suppose there's little risk to explaining further.  I run a shop specializing in chip products:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nonelectronics.com">http://nonelectronics.com</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I want assistance creating a tracker that will appeal to both fami/nerd/[fast]tracker types and those, such as myself, who prefer the LSDJ SONG-&gt;CHAIN-&gt;PHRASE approach.  I'm definitely interested in marketing this tracker on a cartridge, although ideally I'd like (free) emulation to remain a possibility as well.
<br />
<br />I was working with Baron up until recently in an attempt to get things off the ground, but sadly his schedule has prevented him from moving at the pace I would like.  We did little more than discuss what we would like to see from our "dream tracker", and he wrote up a pdf, which I then added some ideas to.  I'll need to get his approval before making that document publicly available.
<br />
<br />Sadly, I'm on the wrong end of IT to do this myself.  I'm a network admin as well as a small business owner.  I do realize that things like this are typically undertaken by one person, coded, tested, updated, distributed, etc., but the truth is I don't have the time needed to learn the ins and outs of the console.  It's my goal to provide the finances needed to get this thing written, and out to the public as soon as possible.

<br />I guess it shouldn't be that hard to port NT2 or famitracker to the NES ? The hard part would be the interface, but else it would just show the lines on the NES screen instead of PC screen, and run the NES native sound replay code.
<br />
<br />You should definitely approach the authors of NerdTracker2 and Famitracker for this IMO. At least you can tell they're qualified for that.

<br />I'm a Fasttracker guy. I've never used LSDJ much, but heard lots of good things about its workflow so I would have looked into it anyway.
<br />My intention was to release the thing to the community for free and charge a small amount for cartridges or at least provide a free version with less features to the public (again, like LSDJ).
<br />
<br />I have been using the Famitracker source in my own projects and am kinda familiar with it, but I've also programmed my own music engine. My time schedule is probably better than Baron's currently.
<br />
<br />I would be willing to team up with someone else on this project or at least do some brainstorming. So if you can't convince jsr, feel free to PM me if interested.

<br />I have thought about making a native tracker but tbh didn't think anybody would actually want to use one. I think LSDJ is little bit different because it's on a portable machine. But maybe I was wrong. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />There was one NES job I did and got paid fairly for, it was a small task though.  Unsurprisingly, most of these kind of jobs seem to devolve into requests for more difficult tasks for little pay, when the specs/requirements start to change after you start..  Of course I was probably guilty of overconfidence in all of those cases.  Actually this offer seems better, because a tracker/music editor is fairly complex already, but seems totally achievable.
<br />
<br />I'm a Fasttracker / Nerdtracker old-timer, but I've used MCK a little, Famitracker a little more, and some other more obscure synth and chip trackers.  Never touched LSDJ.
<br />
<br />Looking at my old dev files, back in 2003 I was working on my own native tracker.  I only made it as far as testing my format, and doing that on one channel only.  Like thefox said, I also was skeptical that anyone would want to use a native tracker.  Around that time I also made a speech synth with a native phoneme-based editor.  Also I've designed a synth chip as a sound expansion for an NES cart that desperately needs music editor support (a long time ago jsr said he'd support it, but I haven't shipped any hardware to anyone, so naturally it's still in obscurity).  So yeah, my background makes me quite interested in this project.
<br />
<br />I work full-time, so unfortunately it's not like I could work on something like this extensively on a daily basis.  I could do maybe 12 hours per week at the most.  But I definitely could use some money for my NESdev bank account (for my R&amp;D and production plans).  There's always very little left over from my day job paychecks, despite me being a cheap bastard. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />So yeah, if this job has a realistic goal (seems to be the case), but also realistic timeframe and compensation, then yeah I'd definitely be up for it.

<br />
<br /><em>And my response:</em>
<br />
<br />I would like to see an option to either arrange in classic tracker fashion/lsdj style arrangement. In other words, the user can choose between the LSDJ song-&gt;chain-&gt;phrase method or just go with a down-scrolling feel. I prefer the LSDJ feel, as it's a bit easier for me to program loops, but there will be others out there who would prefer it the other way around.
<br />
<br />I would like DCPM and instrument tables placed on the far right, making 3 rows and 4 columns instead of 4 rows and 3 columns. Obviously if we had a classic/lsdj switch option some of these windows would need to rearrange.
