Thanks for the bump...  I have had this problem too (for 8 years), with the constant need for Parallel for 4 or 5 Tototek devices, programmer, etc.  Over the years I specifically bought Toshiba laptops because they kept in serial and parallel ports long after all companies' laptops got rid of them.<br /><br />To the OP: don't feel so bad.  I'm still using a screenless 1.8Ghz Celeron Toshiba laptop as a main home computer.  The only thing it can't run (parallel-wise) is FDSLoader...   <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=355">ccovell</a> — Thu Apr 26, 2012 8:30 am</p><hr />

There are three types of cards for emulating parallel port:<br /><br />1. The cheapest one: The one plugged as USBcable. This will work ONLY with printers.<br /><br />2. The easy to find one plugged as PCMCIA/Express Card. This one can work as normal parallel port BUT the problem is that windows assigns it a resources (ADDRESS SPACE) equals to FFF70-FFF7. <br /><img src="http://obrazki.elektroda.pl/2055702000_1299678869_thumb.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />That is different that the regular parallel port(278/378). It CANNOT be changed so if you have a software that has hardcoded port number as 278/378 IT WILL NOT WORK.<br /><br />There is one sollution - there is one virtual software program (I forgtt its name) that lets you emulate parallel port with an external device. So under the guest system you can have parrallel port vissible at 278/378 that is in fact your PCMCIA/Express Card adapter.<br /><br />3. There is one, fairly rare and expensive adapter called Trans Digital made for this purposes that does in-fly conversion of the address, so that Windows sees it as 278/378 without.<br /><br /><a href="http://i38.tinypic.com/2qdyc74.jpg" class="postlink">Wide picture - click to view</a><br /><br />The descibed situation is for Windows. *I DO NOT KNOW* whether you can force linux to work with adapters from point 2.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4898">krzysiobal</a> — Thu Apr 26, 2012 6:08 am</p><hr />

Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna risk getting a parallel ExpressCard only to find out it doesn't work. The one from Quatech mentioned above would probably work, but it's $150. So I think for that price (or roughly the same price if not more to rebuild the PC) I'd rather upgrade my flash cart, then I could ditch the desktop in favor of the laptop like I wanted AND I would have a better flash cart. I'd have to ditch the old Willem programmer as well, so hopefully I wont have to use it.<br /><br />Thanks for the help, guys!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4590">Ziggy587</a> — Tue Jan 18, 2011 8:17 am</p><hr />

I bought an old old laptop with a parallel port for using my GDSF7 copier and other devices. However it has failed me with the Tototek PCE Pro cart as it doesn't support the required EPP mode. I just use a PC in the other room for that. It's a shame though as it's so much nicer to just have a laptop around rather than having to goto another PC or keep another tower around just for the port. <br /><br />I did try a laptop PCI type card to add a parallel port that claimed to support EPP. Howeve I could not figure out any meaningful way to configure it and it never worked.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon Jan 17, 2011 12:43 pm</p><hr />

That Quatech card you posted a link to is PCMCIA, but they also have an ExpressCard version which I could use. It sounds PERFECT, but yeah, a little expensive. $150! lol. A little much. <br /><br />As far as the Tototek programmer goes, I was thinking about getting the newer SNES flash cart from Retro Zone so I could just ditch the need for a parallel port all together, but that's $150 expense. On the other hand, my other options have the potential to be as expensive. <br /><br />So this is why I was hoping to find a parallel solution for my laptop, but it looks like any option I go with is gonna cost me a decent amount of money (rebuild my XP PC, expensive Quatech ExpressCard, upgrade my SNES flash cart).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4590">Ziggy587</a> — Sun Jan 16, 2011 6:10 pm</p><hr />

I have a <a href="http://www.quatech.com/catalog/parallel_pcmcia.php" class="postlink">Quatech</a> card for my laptop that's worked well for me. They aren't cheap though. <br /><br />I don't know which you use more, the willem or tototek programmer.  You might consider replacing your Willem programmer instead, it could be the cheaper option for you. I have <a href="http://www.mcumall.com/comersus/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=4225" class="postlink">one of these</a>, I've been very happy with it (make sure you get the true-USB kind, some are only USB powered and still require a parallel port).  Watch for a cheap one to come up on eBay.  Hang on to the old desktop for when you want to use the Tototek programmer.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4">loopy</a> — Sun Jan 16, 2011 2:50 pm</p><hr />

yeah RDRAM is expensive stuff. It's also a bottleneck. It might be 800mhz but it has a slow latency.  When I come across a customer with RDRAM and they don't have enough I tell them they might as well get a new computer. Its better just to get something faster with a parallel port and load Windows XP on it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=493">Super-Hampster</a> — Sun Jan 16, 2011 1:12 pm</p><hr />

It has a gig of RAM, upgradable to 2GB. Problem is, it uses RDRAM, and even though the prices have come down a lot, this type of RAM is very expensive. A 2GB PC800 kit on eBay would be $100 give or take, out of the question in my opinion. I'd rather put that money into a new mobo AND faster RAM.<br /><br />It's got a 400FSB 3Ghz P4 CPU, which really isn't that fast. And really, I could add all the RAM I want to this PC but it's still not gonna speed up the CPU. Nor the PATA hard drive.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4590">Ziggy587</a> — Sun Jan 16, 2011 7:07 am</p><hr />

Well there's the software for the Willem programmer, and the software for the SNES flash cart from Tototek, then some other random software. And actually, come to think of it, I might consider just keeping the desktop instead of trying to find a parallel port solution for the laptop. There's some programs that I use that work in XP but not in Vista or 7, like HDL Dump. <br /><br />I've used Ubuntu a few times, but I'm not too great with configuring it. I'm not too knowledgeable with Linux. Now that I'm thinking about it, if I can get a 478 mobo on the cheap, I could probably fill the rest out with parts I have lying around then slowly upgrade it to max specs. The laptop would be a lot more convenient, but maybe I should keep XP around for the few programs I have that don't work on 7. And also, I can't seem to find a parallel solution for my laptop that would work for sure.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4590">Ziggy587</a> — Sat Jan 15, 2011 11:56 pm</p><hr />

Hey guys. So basically, I've been keeping an older computer around that has XP on it, mainly for it's parallel port. I need the parallel port in EPP mode for a Willem programmer and the programmer for my SNES flash cart from Tototek. Compared to my main desktop and my new laptop (which have an i7 and an i3 respectively) this old XP desktop is getting hard to use. It would be nice if I could replace this old desktop with my laptop, but the laptop lacks a parallel port. <br /><br />So in short, I'm in search for a way to use my parallel programmers on my laptop. I've seen the parallel-USB adapter, but they all seem to be to create virtual printer ports only. I've seen some USB docking stations with parallel ports, but can't find specified info on them. What looks like the best option is an ExpressCard parallel adapter. I found some that say they support EPP mode, but I'm not sure if my programmers will work on them or not. <br /><br />I found this one on NewEgg:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16839158026&amp;cm_re=expresscard_parallel-_-39-158-026-_-Product">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a ... -_-Product</a><!-- m --><br /><br />One reviewer said it didn't work with his "universal chip programmer" which is probably similar to what I have. If it didn't work for him, I don't have high hopes of it working for me. I've found similar ExpressCard parallel adapters on eBay. A lot of them specify that they're for printers only, but a select few say they work in EPP mode for devices other than printers. Should I take the gamble?<br /><br />Another idea I had, but I'm not sure if this exists. Is there a docking station or port replicator that has a PCI or PCIe slot in it? If that exists, I could just get a parallel PCI card for it, though I don't know if a parallel PCI card would work either. <br /><br />So I figured I'd ask the NES dev community since I'm sure many of you probably use parallel programmers or devices of some kind. Maybe some one has had luck getting them to work on a laptop that lacks a parallel port? The device and drivers would have to support Win 7 64-bit.<br /><br />Any info appreciated. Thanks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4590">Ziggy587</a> — Sat Jan 15, 2011 4:58 pm</p><hr />
