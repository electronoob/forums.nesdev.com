<br />I think the central question is still unanswered.  Do you have examples of the assets ["anything that has to do with the creative aspects"] you can bring to the team?

<br />
<br />Actually, we support, encourage and welcome all kinds of homebrew development. We like seeing projects being built. It's just that you're not very realistic with your current expectations. In short, you should learn to walk before running.

<br />For one thing, it was the full-time job of at least a dozen people, eight hours a day (or more in crunch time), generally working under a competent manager who had previously overseen the completion of a game of comparable scale. For another, once they had an engine, they could reuse it. Wisdom Tree's Spiritual Warfare, for example, was forked from the Crystal Mines engine (used for Exodus and Joshua), and Mega Man 2 was an expansion of the first Mega Man. (In fact, the ruins of some MM1 stages are in unused portions of the ROM, I've read.)

But the #1 thing I will tell you is if you need a programmer, you can probably find one willing to work with you if you show them significant artwork and game design content. So even without a programmer if you can get artistic support for whatever you are hoping to make and start designing it, that will help a lot. Don't be discouraged by not having a programmer right away.

<br />
<br />I'd say it depends on a few factors...I wouldn't worry about it too much yet and just concentrate on a mock up. Then the programmer can weigh in on what's feasible and what isnt.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know that 65xxx processors aren't very well suited for C language because of how the stack works - however, today most companies program microcontrollers exclusively in C, and the output code is often just as good as if it were written in assembly, maybe slightly less performing, but it takes like 5 times less effort to write it and to find errors in it - increasing greatly the chances for a completed project. (this is my "professional" life getting involved with this forum...)
<br />
<br />In fact I think the reason so much of us fails to release complete homebrew games is because of the false rumor that games had to be done in assembly on the NES. OK assembly is fun, you can write very optimised routines, which is good when interfacing with
<br />
<br />@pichi010 : Don't worry about not knowing much about programing - you shouldn't listen those moaners and be discouraged. Instead you should show what you know to do.
<br />
<br />For me it's often the opposite - I know how to program games but I lack some artistic inspiration. Also I have begun many games and never finished any...

<br />
<br />Stack access is not such a large problem. I'd say the bigger problems are:
<br />
<br />Lack of registers.
<br />Register width.
<br />Few addressing modes.
<br />
<br />With that being said, it would certainly be possible to generate good 65xx code from C. It's just that the efforts to develop good compilers/optimizers tend to go into platforms that are used on a large scale, like x86 or ARM.

<br />Hey Thanks! finally someone that supports the cause! lol... @Bregalad, we should talk about the project. well first I'll get that sample of my vision to you all and from there I can see if programmers pop up for the project
