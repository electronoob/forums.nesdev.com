<br />
<br />This version also includes a new 6502 playback library, called MUSE.
<br />
<br />Changes:
<br />
<br />- <a href="http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/projects/nes/muse/" class="postlink">MUSE</a> (6502 playback library for games and demos)
<br />- Linear frequency handling (note slide speed and vibrato is not dependent on the note frequency anymore)
<br />- Glissando
<br />- Max. channel volume was changed from 15 to 63
<br />- Modifier keys don't hang when using Alt+Tab to switch windows (SDL fix)
<br />- Support for display drivers that don’t support non-power-of-two textures
<br />- Fix to copy/pasting from the triangle channel
<br />- Fixed (bad!) bugs in autodelay
<br />- Volume envelope ending in 0 with loop is now considered a note off
<br />- Fixed note slides/etc in the example songs
<br />- Various other bugfixes

<br />Yeah this is unfortunately true, you can't use 150 bpm to get a integral tempo. The reason is that NTSC mode isn't a true NTSC mode in the sense that it doesn't run at 60Hz. Why? Because the NSF code is completely cycle timed for PAL machines, and I didn't want to rewrite it for NTSC. So the ratio between the speeds of PAL/NTSC modes in Musetracker is not 60/50 = 1.2, but 1789773/1662607 = 1.0765 (based on CPU frequencies).
<br />
<br />So, theoretically, the base "integral" tempo for NTSC would then be 125 * 1.0765 = 134.5625 (unfortunately not an integer <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />). So a tempo of 135 bpm should get you pretty close to an integral tempo.
<br />
<br />What I really should do, is add another NTSC mode based on the 60/50 ratio. This wouldn't work with NSF export (unless I add another NSF export option based on MUSE, without raw PCM and auto-delay support). Maybe some day.

<br />That blog quote was based on an older version that had no note frequency and tempo compensation at all. So it doesn't apply here.
<br />
<br />Anyway, thanks again for all the feedback.

What's weird though is I'm now having no trouble at all with frameskip at F96/F01. I don't know if yesterday I ran into a bug or what, it was like each pattern added an extra cpu frame at the end.
<br />Thanks.
