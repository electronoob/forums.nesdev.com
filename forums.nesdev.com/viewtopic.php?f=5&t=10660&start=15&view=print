Probably not as much as your average emulator. I'd bet most of these games using have to reimplement their own UI widgets directly on top of raw GL or XNA instead of relying on the widgets built into the .NET Framework.

Probably not as much as your average emulator.</div><br /><br />This much is true. Many games tend to implement their UI from scratch (XNA in particular because XNA games often eschew WinForms for the sake of cross-platform support), but there is no reason that WinForms UI would actually interfere with an idle loop or any part of the emulation. (That is what you're getting at, right?) Your video output can be housed inside a child control, and the menu, status bar, and dialogs will not interfere visually or generate events/messages that will hurt the performance of the emulator unless you are <em>using</em> the UI, in which case the emulation will typically pause (menu/dialog) or produce very minimal disruption (status bar or misc UI that doesn't suspend emulation).<br /><br />I have seen XNA examples where WinForms UI is used to interact with the software (rotate, move, add, remove, etc. objects) to good effect. Generally, with game programming in .NET, the only unique obstacle is the need to avoid producing garbage since garbage collections visibly hurt performance.
