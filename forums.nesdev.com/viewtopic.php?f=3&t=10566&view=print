	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Scrolling in Firefox in GNOME/Compiz (with at least the nouveau driver) makes SDL_Flip() and SDL_RenderPresent() (SDL2) extremely slow for me, to the point of only being able to do ~30 FPS with everything removed but those calls. Chromium doesn't cause nearly the same slowdown. Might be related to the way Firefox draws the screen, if it needs to DMA a lot of data or causes some lock to be held for a long time, but that's just speculation.<br /><br />Anyone else seeing the same thing? Might need to drop SDL_Flip() flip calls or do the emulation in a separate thread that signals the rendering thread to get around it I guess. Currently it causes bad sound stuttering (especially with SDL2) as sample generation is done in the same thread that SDL_Flip()s (and yeah, that's arguably poor practice anyway).

I wonder if you made an xinerama-ignorant build of SDL whether it would improve performance.
