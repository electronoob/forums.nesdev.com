I mean there's no real reason to waste time by removing something if there's enough empty space to get game finished.</div><br />Around what year or what ROM size did professional game developers stop feeling like putting huge amounts of effort into trimming down a game to fit the next lower power of two ROM size? We had a discussion about this recently on Slashdot, where the Mac OS team filled unused space in the Macintosh SE's ROM with three full-screen photos of the developers (G 41D89A from the debugger). A user joked that it would have been a better use of engineer's time to make a herculean effort to cut the program's footprint down to the next lower power of two.</div><br />That's a very good argument. But I' was thinking about cases where you can't make smaller ROM, game is finished and there is some garbage.Yea, I did not percise it, sorry about that.<br />Example:<br />UNROM 64kb game which is finished, can't be cut down anymore and have empty spaces occupied with some source garbage.<br />While developers could add something extra by removing that garbage, it would be an additional costs, right?<br />And who want an additional costs with finished product?

Also, why did'nt they just wipe the uncompiled the code? USA version is 128kb ROM...This is really anti &quot;costs saving&quot; thing to do.(I mean, 128 EPROM is cheaper than 256, thus saving costs.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well Europe's DL has 2x 128's instead of 128K PRG and CHR-RAM. I can't tell since I'm on Ubuntu, but maybe the US version just went at 30FPS speed with one full VBlank and render being to transfer more tiles and the CHR-ROM was used to gain the speed? I'm just guessing watching the youtube video of the EU/US games.

Since the Japanese version also has faster music (6/5 as fast as the original), I'm guessing the Japanese version was a port of the European version.

But only one is the complete script for the game. But an alternate possibly complete script exists but I think it contained some no-no words for Nintendo of America's policies at the time.
