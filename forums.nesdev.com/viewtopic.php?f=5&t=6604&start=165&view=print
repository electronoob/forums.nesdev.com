<br />
<br />However, I do agree with WhatULive4 on both points:
<br />
<br />1) Blogs are fine, but possibly not the best presentation style for a contest.  They are more suited to a chronology of independent topics, not a contest with some (possibly) dynamic content (list of entrants and their submissions, all in a table on one page).
<br />
<br />2) nintendoage.com would get a lot more exposure, and is more likely to exist years from now, where our works can be semi-immortalized.

<br />
<br />No, I have not.  That's kinda funny though.  I just picked "curling" totally at random.
<br />
<br />I'm not very good at the mario-style games, fighting games or sports games, so generally ignore them.  I totally suck at <em>Raymond Raving Rabbits</em> and similar games.  Which sucks for me, as my wife loves that kind of game, and I can't stand them.  I prefer RTS, RPG and the various Zelda games and similar titles (Crystalis, Faria).

In fact, I'm not worried about someone "stealing it", I just don't want to leak it before I have a chance to document it and scrutinize it. <br /><br />In my mind, a game is only a "clone" if the author had knowledge of a previous example, and that he or she intended for the new game to have something in common (game play wise) with the original.</div>
<br />Well maybe you're right, but even if you were doing a NES curling game you'd use similar element that other sprots games uses.
<br />Personally I really hate non-racing sport games, so I wouldn't be too much interested.... you'd rather want to play the actual IRL game instead if you get the chance to.
<br />
<br />Racing games are good because they allow you to have fun without taking the dangers of IRL racing, and with much less damage to the environment.
<br />
<br />I agree there is different levels of cloning, the one is do do a really similar gameplay, such as Tepple's tetris clone.
<br />
<br />If you do a platformer, noone can call it a Mario / Megaman / Castlevania clones because those games are characterised by their levels, which are copyrighted. This isn't the case for games such as Tetris, where there is no levels.
<br />
<br />Then there is the stadium where you do a game similar in genre, but which plays quite differently such as Dr Mario being based on Tetris, or Final Fantasy being based on Dragon Quest. Then there is the stade where you come with many ideas merged from different games from different genres and mix them all, then it's not a clone anymore.

<br />Of course you don't mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar" class="postlink">IndyCar</a>, formerly Indy Racing League. Even so, <a href="http://www.philshobbyshop.com/phs/carstrucks/main.jsf" class="postlink">one of my employer's clients</a> might beg to differ. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Brock-Lee/100001122150455" class="postlink">Alternate Universe Toad</a> has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPqRue51GZ8" class="postlink">something to say about this</a> as well.

<br />
<br />Wordpress doesn't have to be blog style.  You can make everything with "Pages" instead of "Posts" and no one would be able to tell it wasn't a regular site.  But that's beside the point.  I didn't realize that WhatULive4 was so on top of this.  I completely agree that NA is a better choice for hosting this.  The placeholder site I put up is now down.
