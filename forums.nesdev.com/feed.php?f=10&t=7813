I discovered <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macifom/" class="postlink">Macifom</a> by chance this weekend. It has a basic code debugger that's helped me out a few times. Seems like it's in early development, though, as some controls don't seem to work.<br /><br />I think the developer hangs around here. Or at least used to.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4879">shawnleblanc</a> — Mon Jun 06, 2011 7:16 am</p><hr />

I use p65 for an assembler and Tile Molester for chr editor, both of which I also use on Windows.  If you use Tile Molester make sure you find the latest version (v0.16), a lot places have the previous version which didn't work on Macs for some reason.  I also managed to get FamiTracker running under Wine, although I don't use it often.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=120">Tom</a> — Fri Jun 03, 2011 6:23 am</p><hr />

I still have yet to figure out how to add items to the QScintilla context menu so I can add back more of the features I had with the previous Qt text editor.<br /><br />It's even working to the point that if you've built a .nes outside of Nesicide and it has a .dbg file built along with it, you can just load the .nes into Nesicide and it'll do source-level debugging, symbol watching, etc [it assumes the debug info file is &lt;rom-name&gt;.dbg.  (What I mean is you don't need to create a .nesproject with all your source in it if you just want to use Nesicide as a debugger).  If you create a project you can change what the debug info file and other files are named.<br /><br />I'm always looking for constructive (or destructive) feedback to improve the thing...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3705">cpow</a> — Fri Jun 03, 2011 5:12 am</p><hr />

That has since been replaced with external usage of CA65/LD65.  As far as project templates to get started, I've been using tepples' Russian Roulette demo (NROM) to do most of my development testing of Nesicide.  Currently I don't have support for external tools other than CA65/LD65 though so if you have your own baked tools for generating assembly or CHR-ROM data or whatever, those aren't yet callable from Nesicide.  Eventually it'll be at the "export makefile, call make" state, but for right now it just uses Qt QProcess calls to execute CA65/LD65 to get the job done.  <br /><br />I *just* put a new Windows MSI on the <a href="http://nesicide.com/?s=download" class="postlink">website</a>.  I realize you want OSX...hyarion is the guy who does that for me.  I'll see if I can rouse him...he's usually pretty responsive on FreeNode (#nesicide).   <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> <br /><br />With regard to tutorials though, seriously, get <a href="http://www.pineight.com/nes/roulette-0.01.zip" class="postlink">Russian Roulette</a>.  From there you really just need to:<br /><br />0. Download and install the latest snapshot release (2.13.9 is required for debugger integration) of <a href="http://www.cc65.org/index.php#Download" class="postlink">CC65</a>.<br />1. Open Nesicide,<br />2. Create a new project type in a name and give it the path to where you extracted the Russian Roulette ZIP.<br />3. Add "nes.ini" as the Linker Config file in Project Properties, Linker tab.<br />4. Navigate in the project browser pane to "Project-&gt;Source Code".  Click and select "Add an existing file".  Select "src/main.s".  Repeat for "src/pads.s" and "src/random.s".<br />5. Navigate in the project browser pane to "Project-&gt;Binary Files".  Click and select "Add an existing file".  Select "roulette.chr".  <br />6. Navigate in the project browser pane to "Project-&gt;Graphics Banks".  Click and select "Add bank".  Give it a name.  Navigate to it in the project browser pane and double click to open it.  Where it says "&lt;click to add or edit&gt;", click, and type "roulette.chr".  It should recognize the name and show you the graphics you just added.<br />7. In the toolbar hit the icon that looks like a single gear.  This should cleanly and successfully build the project.  Then hit the icon that looks like a blue memory card.  This should load your creation into the emulator.  Then hit the icon that looks like a green "play" button...and you should see the Russian Roulette text in the emulator.<br /><br />If I get time maybe I'll put together a video of me doing the above steps.  <br /> <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3705">cpow</a> — Thu Jun 02, 2011 9:17 pm</p><hr />
