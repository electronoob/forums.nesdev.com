	</div><br /><br />There are 2 more CPU cycles left, but to illustrate how it works, it is sufficient.<br /><br />tLATCH is latch's propagation delay from enable = '1' to output valid.<br />tDECOD is combinational propagation delay to decode CPU_RD from full address (bank + offset) and RWB signal.<br />When second read cycle starts (read $01 from ROM), CPU_RD is low, and it goes to '1' after bank latch changes its ouptut. Latch is enabled during low phase in PHI2, but new bank byte is not present in data bus until 33ns after PHI2 falling edge. Those 33ns in undeterminated state, CPU_RD is '1' again.<br />Maybe I missing something, but I've beeing thinking a lot on this lately and can't find any other explanation...

In fact, it is possible that it is that way, but I don't know.<br />/ROMSEL is decoded from address and bank, so maybe there is no need for /CPU_RD to be decoded from them again.

Everybody who might contribute, including me, is busy doing other stuff.<br /><br />But it's certainly fun to think about and talk about.  And there is one member here who arrived harbouring the intention to port Metal Slug to the SNES, and has given it a lot of thought, even if he now feels it would be too big a task for him alone.  A few other members are known to have been working on stuff that could be applicable to such a port, such as predictive animation, dynamic sprite VRAM allocation, and HDMA audio data streaming.  Not to mention an FPGA implementation of the S-DD1...  I can't rule out the possibility that this project may get off the ground someday.</div><br /><br />The best part is always the theory XD<br /><br />Maybe the snes has the colors, the sound, and most of the animations at a seemed rate to the original, but definitely i think it has a lack of proccessing and sprites fill rate (it only has to be seen how it works in the original neo geo game).<br /><br />But there was so much legend when something did us to believe that some ports were impossible.

But the game engine was not very efficient, and they had to rewrite it for Metal Slug X.  Also, the SNES CPU is perhaps close to twice as efficient per clock as the 68000.  A homebrew port would be heavily optimized; I'd still expect slowdown, but it might not be all that horrible.<br /><br />Note that the original game is 30 fps.  This means that it has about twice as much going on as a hypothetical 60 fps game would be able to manage with the same CPU load, and comparisons with existing SNES software (which is almost all 60 fps) should take this into account.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">and sprites fill rate</div><br />To be fair, the Neo Geo had to build its backgrounds out of sprites, so the overdraw advantage wasn't quite as large as it looked.  And most of the bosses could easily be done with BG layers on SNES.

As far as I know it's still absolutely common to use terms like &quot;gigabit&quot; or &quot;gigabyte&quot; for things like modern FLASH chips and SD cards, with &quot;giga&quot; meaning 1024^3, one reason is that chip manufacturing does somewhat require having a power of 2 for storage array. Whereas, SD cards are usually having an area reserved for automatic replacement of worn out sectors, so the available user space may appear to be less than expected, but that's unrelated to the 1000 vs 1024 thing.<br />Magnetic discs don't have that requirement for powers of 2, so manufacturers may often mean (1000^n) when they are saying &quot;kilo/mega/giga&quot; in their specifications (and for transfer rates and clock rates it's even more common to use 1000^n). Of course it would be neat to avoid that confusion, only, those new scientific units like &quot;mebibits&quot; are sounding a lot too much like childish language to me : /<br />As for myself, I would rather avoid to adopt those terms. Another approach would be defining the exact value in Hz or bytes somewhere in the introduction/specs, and then using an abbreviated value in the rest of the document; like 1234567Hz (1.2MHz), or 400h bytes (1Kbyte).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">magno wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Hope this handmade timing diagram will help to explain why I don't think CPU_RD is 3 master cycles in FastROM mode:</div><br />I've no idea which timings are correct... but your handmade diagrams &amp; schematics are really pretty : )
