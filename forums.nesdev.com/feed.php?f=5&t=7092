Me? Well I just try to look at it in a way it's done and how it could be done in that way, but when I realize it's in a modern language like C, I get mad! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yeah, and in case you want to know (We own basically all of Williams arcade boards and a defender cabinet) the game Defender uses 48K of RAM that the video out is used for, and the VSync resets it to the begining and a counter ust increments an address, and inside the 48K, There X bytes one the screen, X bytes for RAM, X bytes for Screen and X bytes for RAM. So if you ever see the left side of the screen with stuff on it, it's the stack, they put it on the screen and adjusted it off from the factory. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Pretty bad for a programmer and their crew to work around, but Jarvis and Demar did a good job, and am amazing job on Stargate! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> I love my Defender <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />Sorry though about always mentioning C.

Actually I'd hope anyone would learn C before the C++ extensions (not that you'd have to, but it's simpler).<br /><br />I found PC development pretty intimidating too for a long time, but now that I've gotten comfortable with C, I've found it easy to start by using a library such as <a href="http://www.lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/index.php" class="postlink">SDL</a>.  For my synth I got immediate (not necessarily correct, but..) results for my audio, graphics, and input.  But yeah it's a lot more work not having the benefit of any kind of 2D graphics hardware.  So you pretty much 'emulating' your own graphics system into a huge bitmap.  And no 'soundchip', so your audio routines need to be as fast as possible (for an action game or similar).  But just knowing how doesn't mean I want to do it, heheh, NES/SNES is much easier to get into to.<br /><br />LOL at the article.  Summary "Game Maker is slow at running games, so spend a bunch of time working needlessly on minor optimizations (to your artwork, even)".  Something like that is basic enough to be automated (if the compiler was smart).  And makes so many things impractical because of all the different combinations.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Oct 25, 2010 3:42 pm</p><hr />

Sprites are two-textured triangles? I don't get it....XD And you have to decide to either shorten code, or include more images to make it run "smoother"? Wow......what a joke.Do both. Shorten code, include less sprites. Less code doesn't mean it does less, it does with less more efficient things.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hhaahahah....this is so funny. Optimization something that'll be forgotten in 10 years. Except for us.
