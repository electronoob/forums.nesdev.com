<br />
<br />Was/is this series of games well received in Japan?

<br />That game was never released outside of Japan.

<br />
<br />This is not true. In fact it went like this:
<br />In 1942, the enemy planes <em>looked</em> like Japanese designs, but they used original names so they didn't resemble counterparts in real-life (in particular, the famous Ayako bomber which appeared in <em>every</em> game of the series had its name based on a certain female staff member).
<br />
<br />In 1943, most of the enemies were based on real Japanese planes and fleets (with a few exception such as the obligatory Ayako), includiing their names. In particular, the last boss is Yamato (yes, <em>that</em> Yamato, the real one). This certainly was odd at the time. These names were retained in the updated release 1943 Kai.
<br />
<br />However, they changed the names of all these enemies in the Famicom port (if only that version could be called a port) to original ones (actually names of warriors from the Three-Kingdom era). They did the same thing to the PCE port of 1943 Kai.
<br />
<br />Since the sequels (1941, 19XX and 1944) used either a more fantasy setting or weren't based on battles against the Japanese they didn't have such problems I think.

<br />Thank you for the clarification.  I don't recall where I read what I had posted, but I did read it someplace (eg, I didn't just make it up).  The other source must have been wrong.
