If needed eventually, I'd be happy to find useful similarities between Pently and Famitracker, but like dougeff said, it might be unnecessary.<br /><br />For example, demanding the use of certain instrument names in Famitracker, so that upon conversion, certain Famitracker instruments can be interpreted as instruments or attack settings.

It contains fixes for defects discovered during the development of ft2pently.<br /><br /><ul><li>Project moved to <a href="https://github.com/Qix-/pently" class="postlink">GitHub</a></li><li>pentlyas.py: proper argument parsing</li><li>pentlyas.py: options to read input from stdin, write output to file</li><li>pentlyas.py: option to generate period table (requested by dougeff)</li><li>pentlyas.py: writes data sizes in bytes as comments in output (requested by NovaSquirrel)</li><li>pentlyas.py: turned some internal exceptions into informative error messages (reported by NovaSquirrel).</li><li>pentlyas.py: treats r and w the same in drum patterns (requested by NovaSquirrel)</li><li>pentlyas.py: parentheses for slur for LilyPond parity</li><li>Legato note overwrites uninjected attack's pitch (reported by NovaSquirrel)</li></ul><br />By integrating (optional) period table generation into pentlyas, I have made less work for anyone who wants to compile a py2exe version. Reading input from stdin could allow piping ft2pently's output through pentlyas. The data size diagnostic helps a composer see how close a project's score is to its byte budget without having to parse hex numbers out of an ld65 map file.<br /><br />The legato problem made grace notes more difficult to use with instruments that have longer attack phases, which are more likely to occur in automated conversions. Early versions of Pently (through 0.03) did not support FamiTracker-style envelopes. Instead, notes either sustained at their starting volume or decayed linearly from their starting volume, just like instruments in NerdTracker II. Pently 0.04 added an attack envelope to all pitched instruments as well as a fifth track that <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=157022#p157022" class="postlink">inserted attacks into another channel</a>. (The attack track concept was inspired by <a href="http://nesdev.com/2A03/sml_mix.zip" class="postlink">&quot;Super Mario Land NES-Mix&quot;</a> by Phlumb-Dumb.)<br /><br />Versions of Pently with attack envelopes also have an arpeggio effect, as well as a legato effect that changes the note on a channel to a different pitch without restarting its envelope. (Legato on a woodwind instrument corresponds to notes that are not tongued, and on a guitar, it represents hammer-ons and pull-offs. In NT2, a note is played legato by not giving it an instrument number. In FT, it's done with the most rapid portamento-to-note, like <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">3FF</tt>.) In previous versions of Pently supporting attack phase (0.04 through 0.05wip3), a note played legato would change the pitch only of the sustain phase. This didn't cause problems with the idiomatic Pently instrument type that has a relatively short attack and an NT2-style decay on the sustain. But because a converted FT instrument's sustain phase (the last step of its volume envelope) cannot decay the way an NT2 instrument can, the attack phase (all steps but the last) has to be made much longer. I originally had legato not overwrite the attack's pitch so as not to interfere with an attack injected by the attack track. But I found a way to distinguish attacks on the channel's own track from injected attacks and modify only the former's pitch, by taking advantage of a different hack I added to pause a channel's arpeggio while an injected attack is playing and restart it once the attack ends.<br /><br />[This post put me over 2^14.]

FamiTracker's vibrato is typical of tracker vibrato, which makes the depth constant in period units. This means that for higher pitches, which have lower periods, a given amount of vibrato depth will sound stronger than it does for lower pitches, which have higher periods. But if the change in period for a given vibrato depth setting is proportional to the note's own period, it'll sound the same for low and high pitches.<br /><br />I've also found that looping the vibrato once every 12 frames (roughly equivalent to FamiTracker <a href="http://famitracker.com/wiki/index.php?title=Effect_4xy" class="postlink">effect <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">45y</tt></a> for depth <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">y</tt>) is within normal limits of vibrato on a string or wind instrument.<br /><br />This, however, leaves portamento as an excuse.

In pattern bytecode, codes $00 through $D7 produce notes and rests. Codes $D8 through $DE enable or disable effects, and $FF terminates a pattern. The changelog entry states that effect codes, which had previously been processed using a compare/branch tree, are now processed with a jump table that uses the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/RTS_Trick" class="postlink">RTS Trick</a>. This makes the code more maintainable, especially as I add effects (like vibrato) or remove them (the <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.if</tt> commands to leave out code related to vibrato or arpeggio).

On average, each effect takes 2 bytes for each channel that it affects: one for the parameter and one for the current state. So that's 8 bytes if an effect affects only actual channels or 10 bytes if it affects a track (including the attack track). If I added all the effects, RAM use would climb back into the range of heavyweight engines even for soundtracks that aren't using a particular effect. I can't just use <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.res</tt> controlled by <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">.ifdef</tt> because I'm storing the channels' state somewhat interleaved: four bytes for pulse 1, then four for pulse 2, etc. for correlation with the offsets in APU MMIO space ($4000-$400F).<br /><br />So I might have to think of a more clever way to pack state variables needed by those features that are enabled, using ca65 macros if I can or Python if I can't.
