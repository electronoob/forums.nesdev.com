<br />
<br />
<br />You probably know the program GoodNES which can rename ROM files and give you the official names. Now, I need to know: What's actually the relationship between various ROM versions and their corresponding cartridge?
<br />
<br />For example, there are two American versions of "The Legend of Zelda": PRG0 and PRG1. PRG1 has that warning text in the Game Over screen that tells you to press the reset button when switching the NES off.
<br />
<br />Now, if I want to buy a specific version, what do I have to pay attention to? Can I be sure that the game with the number "NES-ZL-USA" is PRG0 and "NES-ZL-USA-I" is PRG1? What if there are games (like "Super Mario Bros. 3") that even have "USA-2", "USA-1*" etc. even though there is only a PRG0 and PRG1 ROM?
<br />
<br />
<br />What does the text "REV-A" on some game packages mean? Does this only refer to the package or also to the game code? For example, according to the ROM names, there's only one US version of "Metroid". And still, I have seen various versions of the game cartridge and the package:
<br />One with a round seal of quality and no serial number.
<br />One with a round seal of quality and a serial number ending in "USA".
<br />One with an oval seal of quality and a serial number (I guess) ending in "USA".
<br />One with an oval seal of quality and the text "REV-A" on the package.
<br />
<br />So, can I be sure that it's all the same game version and only the number differs? Or are those various versions of the game?
<br />
<br />
<br />Why is the US "Metroid" in GoodNES version 3 called PRG0 even though there's no PRG1?
<br />
<br />
<br />Why were there two versions of the Japanese/American "Super Mario Bros." (PRG0 and PRG1) in GoodNES 2, but there is only one version in GoodNES 3? If we don't take the European version or collections like "Mario and Duck Hunt" into account, does that mean that there was only one version of the standalone game? And if yes, why was the [b1] dump ever considered an actual separate version PRG1 in GoodNES 2 in the first place?
<br />
<br />
<br />The ROM "Soccer (JU)" in GoodNES 2 is "Soccer (JU) [b1]" in GoodNES 3. And the PRG0 version of "Donkey Kong" suddenly becomes the PRG1 version. How do I even have a chance to get the correct ROM? The websites all use the naming format of GoodNES 2. So, do I just have to look for "Soccer (JU) [b1]" which will turn into "Soccer (JU)" when I rename it with GoodNES 3? Or what is the general way to do here?
<br />
<br />
<br />It would be great if somebody could help me with these issues.

<br />That and some other questions that I asked in detail. Questions that cannot be answered with a mere "Meh, GoodNES isn't that good. Forget it."

On NES I'm not really sure they did that completely, as I'm sure I've seen the "A" stamped on NES games, but wonder if it was for that reason. They have a "Rev-A" on the back label of my 5 zelda games except for 1 of them, but I believe that is the actual label revision, sans red text on bottom.

You can calculate CRC32 of PRG and CHR of the GoodNES ROM and use it to find the cart Catalog ID from the database. If there are only two revisions of the game, one entry in the database will be enough to distinguish both revisions.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if there's a relationship between GoodNES's naming and the carts naming, but if I had to guess I'd say there probably isn't.

<br />
<br />That's what I believe, it means the physical labels text was changed. THE rev-a have the red text. The non-a's don't.

<br />
<br />The "Rev-A" on the back label is about the revision of the label itself, and the added number on the front label, like "NES-ZL-USA-1" is about the revision of the front label itself.
<br />
<br />I'm not 100% sure of what I said but this is the conclusions I can take after looking at Bootgod's database.
<br />
<br />The goodnes tool is inaccurate, but normally (PRG0) and (PRG1) should indicate the ROM revisions, while [b1] or anything like this means a bad dump or hacked ROM, avoid using those roms.

Get your star bit or screwdriver (for some older cartridges), open it up, and read the data off of the board and chips.

In case you were unaware, the GoodTools suite isn't &quot;old.&quot; Cowering still updates the individual tools. He can be contacted with updates via IRC or email. I've contacted him with a few updates / corrections in the past regarding some SNES titles. An updated GoodSNES was released very shortly after.<br /><br />If you find an inaccuracy with the latest Good[X] for any platform, do the community a favor and let Cowering know so he can update his database.
