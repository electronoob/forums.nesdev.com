		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I showed the new kazzo to these #nesdev regulars. One thought the new layout was &quot;slightly less horrid&quot;; another thought it was even worse. Mixing DIP and SMD and the way you did power/ground fill allegedly wastes space and makes the PCB messy. And I hope they were joking when they said you &quot;should just not make boards, period&quot;, and that we'll never run out of donor carts. Fortunately, one of them defended you a little: &quot;well everyone has a learning period&quot;.

Guess I can stop feeling like I might be missing out on something by not frequenting the IRC if those are the comments by the 'regulars'.  Please don't bother in presenting my response to them and then continuing with the talking through you.  I don't mind you posting things that were brought up in the IRC if it's constructive.  But if they're just trying to poop on my face because they some how feel their donors are threatened by my work that discussion can stay on the IRC and I'll stay here.  If they feel inclined to discuss it further they can post themselves or PM/email me.<br /><br />For anyone who's curious of why I choose the DIP package on the mcu, I have made that decision based on what I thought users would appreciate.  I think it's the same reason the arduino is all smt aside from the main mcu.  The board size cost of going with a DIP for the mcu was negligible.  Going SMT on the avr would have only reduced the board size by ~1cm on the one edge which is only ~12% at most.  The bigger cost is the socket, and time needed to hand solder through hole compared to baking on SMT.  If I were being selfish I would have much rather have gone SMT to be honest.  Going with the socketed DIP was a cost that I deemed worth it to the benefit of the user.  Without a case and due to the nature of a project like this, people are pretty quick to start tinkering and might somehow kill their mcu.  With a SMT mcu most people would have to toss it in the trash.  But this route allows me to ship off a $2 mcu and they can pop it in themselves.  Or even acquire their own mcu if they have access to an avr programmer.  The smt parts I do use pose little risk for damage, and allowed for sizable asse [EDIT: think I was trying to say &quot;allowed for significant increase in ease of assembly&quot;]

They are really easy to use, and the fact that you are willing to tailor boards to a users' needs is absolutely phenomenal. I've made a few orders from you so far, and I will be back for more soon enough I'm sure!

Things fail based on temperature, humidity, <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/P/phase-of-the-moon.html" class="postlink">phase of the moon</a>, etc. A 1 nF cap isn't beefy enough to properly reject sags in an IC's power supply. Though you did add ground fill, some of the ground traces appear so narrow they look like resistors (<a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/5450" class="postlink">follow the current</a>). Better busing means fewer vias and a smaller board. Lining up chips end-to-end may look cute, but it can make routing harder.<br /><br />Case in point: Someone mentioned a Codemasters game that works on a front-loading NES Control Deck but crashes on the NES-101, because whoever manufactured the board for Camerica forgot to populate a bypass cap somewhere on the board. He soldered in the proper cap, and it worked perfectly.<br /><br />Case in point 2 (added 2014-02-19): <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=104980#p104980" class="postlink">Adding caps worked for magno</a>.<br /><br />I'm not trying to dis; I too have had similar problems in software-ville where things blew up when trying to run insufficiently robust code out of its original environment. A bug in initializing memory led to a humorous graphical problem in Thwaite (player missiles being drawn with the balloon graphic), and a bug in palette copying led to graphical corruption in Concentration Room. Neither problem occurred when the game was run in isolation; they appeared when the games were included in the multicart. A few programs by Shiru and Nioreh had a similar problem: when clearing nametables, they ended up clearing the pattern tables too if run on a CHR RAM cart. But fortunately, all these problems were documented and fixed in time for the STREEMERZ multicart.

I agree fewer vias, and bussing makes boards smaller.  However setting guidelines for 'perfect' busing would require boards at least twice the size for my current designs.  I bus signals within the limits of what I've determined as the minimum board size based on component selection and placement.  One of the biggest factors for me which isn't being considered by any comments thus far, is design for manufacturing.

Your products are rock-solid. The haters out there complaining that your buses ain't straight are also the guys that have never shipped a damn thing. You've done so much more for this community than any of them ever have! Hold your head up high! You should be proud of the things you've accomplished, and comforted in the thought that the community as a whole has benefited from your labors.<br /><br />Before you came along the only way to get a development system was to either slice up an existing cart (I'm looking at <strong>YOU</strong> Ultima: Exodus  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> ) or buying a bare PCB from a guy that sells pirated games (not getting into that here). Now you can get a reusable flash cart and a reliable USB-based flasher for under $40 USD from a reputable manufacturer.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal">THIS MAKES MY MIND ESPLODE!!!</span></em></strong><br /><br />So thank you, <strong>THANK YOU INL</strong> for all of your hard work and contributions to this community. They are, in my opinion, among the most important we have seen.<br /><br />Consider: If we didn't the hardware hackers we wouldn't understand the hardware like we do. If we didn't have the developers we wouldn't have homebrew to play. If we didn't have you we wouldn't have easily accessible flashcarts to play homebrew on, or develop with, or to hack the hardware with.<br /><br />So yea, ignore the bastards and let's hope they all die in a fire. Tepples, you can copy / paste that last bit in IRC if you'd like <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Even if your products are comparable in quality to the &quot;cheap Chinese crap&quot; flashers that kickstarted the GBA and DS homebrew scenes (and I'm not necessarily claiming that they are), you still have the advantage of a command of English to be more responsive to feature requests from customers in Europe and the Americas.

Perhaps having to work at both room temperature and sub-freezing temperature, unattended for long periods of time, with a single failure causing beaucoup bucks of real-world damages, changes how much reliability one feels like he has to design into a product.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">qbradq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Consider: If we didn't the hardware hackers we wouldn't understand the hardware like we do.</div><br />Except one of these hardware hackers who produced a bunch of mapper docs is also the freezer guy.
