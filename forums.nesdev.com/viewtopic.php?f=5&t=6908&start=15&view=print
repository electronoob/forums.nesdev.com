<br />He did on the British show from 1984 to 1986, and the American show in 1989.  He's only made one appearance in relation to Thomas since then.

<br />Funny you should mention that, because I've always heard shades of "Yesterday" in Twoson and Threed. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> There's even one song in the game that samples Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxmBzMfM2ww">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxmBzMfM2ww</a><!-- m -->

<br />Oh, and I think Hip Tanaka said in an interview somewhere that he was inspired by the Beatles. And there's also a well-known anecdote of the time Koji Kondo met Paul McCartney (on an airplane, I think?), and Paul actually knew who Koji was and hummed the SMB theme to him.
<br />
<br />And gee guys, if the early Beatles sucked so hard and there was never anything outstanding about them, why are they still the most successful band anywhere in the world, and why is the most covered song in the world "Yesterday"? 
<br />
<br />Here's a hint: it's more than that they were just cute and were the first ones to do the "long hair thing".

<br />I think this is kind of what generations of gamers younger than ourselves 
<br />might say about all those older games that we love. :-)
<br />
<br />Nostalgia is a given factor, but some things/products really are that good
<br />despite its age.

I'm a pretty big fan of music from that era though, but I tend to lean more towards the 70's with bands like Fleetwood Mac (seriously, don't even talk smack about them or I will kill your face!).
