		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Welp, back with another newb question.
<br />
<br />I assume that with my mapper #0, 32k PRG-ROM, that it is loaded into the NES' CPU memory to run. So that means I can use self modifying code.... right?
<br />
<br />Well, I tried to assuming it would work (speeding up my code some more.). Basically it's like this....
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp;lda map_pointer_hi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta store_new_byte+2<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br /><br />store_new_byte:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;sta map_buffer,x<br /></div>
<br />
<br />However, stepping through it in Nintendulator and NESten several times, I see that the "sta store_new_byte+2" does not actually change the hi byte of the sta map_buffer,x 's address ("label"+2). It's odd to me. The addresses are compiled right, everything is in order until it gets there, and executes the sta instruction just mentioned, but does not change the memory address in the labeled sta ##,x.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure why this is not happening so I've come to ask if there's something I'm missing here. I thought I could use SMC since the program data that is running is in CPU RAM.
<br />
<br />I tried not to ask another dumb question, but I couldn't find any information regarding this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Code does not get moved to RAM when run, it stays in ROM.  Therefore self modifying code will only work if you copy it to RAM then jump to it.  That's why your code isn't changing that address -- your're writing to ROM, which will not have an effect on the contents of ROM (short of bankswapping, but since this is mapper 0, that's a nonissue).
<br />
<br />And don't worry.  This wasn't a stupid question ^^.  That's actually a very reasonable assumption.

<br />
<br />Not necessarily, if your code fits there, the CPU will happily run it anywhere at $00-$7FF.  In fact, in the last intro program I wrote, almost all of the internal RAM was one huge string of LDA #0 / STA $2007, and I modified the #0 depending on the data needed.
<br />
<br />You just have to assemble the code with the origin at it's RAM location, and copy the routine over to RAM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for the suggestion Memblers. I only really wanted to use SMC for a very time intensive loop. The subroutine was only 85 bytes, so now it resides is actual RAM. Everything works great. Saved myself 2400 clock cycles in most cases.
<br />
<br />Thanks again everyone. Glad all of you can tolerate me and my questions  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />

<br />EDIT : I was signed in before when I made those "Guest" posts. But it seems that sometimes when I log in and go to the desired forum, I get logged out. I'm not hitting the back button to do this.

<br />
<br />Happens to me all the time too, it's annoying.  Also makes it easy for me to miss posts, since they're usually not marked as new after I log in a second time.  I'm not sure why that happens, I've never seen it on other sites running phpBB.
