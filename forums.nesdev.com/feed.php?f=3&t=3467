I just got done going thru and preparing to dump these Namco carts, I actually found 4 or 5 '106' carts that didn't use a blob for the mapper at least. It's a surface mount chip with the label '163'. Marty showed me a pic of one of these in the past, so I knew they were out there. Still have yet to run into anything with a '106' label...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Fri Jul 06, 2007 7:25 am</p><hr />

I see.  It appears Nestopia's mapper naming could use a little more work, and the implementations could be more fine-tuned.  I personally can only go by what I know, and much of what I know comes from the Nestopia source.<br /><br />You might want to get in touch with Marty to straighten out the Namco mappers.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Tue Jul 03, 2007 12:44 pm</p><hr />

I was aware of a number of wiring differences, but I believe the chips themselves work the same.  I only switched the 108/109/118 carts to mapper 206 that were previously set to 4. The only game I've processed so far that doesn't fall into that category is Quinty, mapper 88. I'm thinking there must be a mistake in Nestopia now because mapper 88 has a 74xx32 and it's behavior is a bit different from what you mentioned. Only the lower 64K can be loaded into PPU $0000-0fff and the upper 64K can only be loaded into PPU $1000-1fff. That's probably where the OR by 40h is coming into play.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Tue Jul 03, 2007 12:00 pm</p><hr />

Registers $8000 and $8001 work as you'd expect, but for commands 2-5, the value written to $8001 is OR'ed with $40.<br /><br />* Mapper 76 ("NAMCOT 108 +74LS32") - The implementation of this one is derived from the MMC3.  Writes to $C000-FFFF are ignored, and commands 2-5 select 2K CHR banks at $0000, $0800, $1000, and $1800 (commands 0-1 are useless).  I doubt that this accurately reflects hardware (seems hackish to me).<br /><br />* Mapper 95 ("NAMCOT 118 +A1.D5.MIRR") - Same as mapper 88, except that bit 5 of $8001 controls mirroring in commands 0-5 (similar to the T*SROM boards).<br /><br />* Mapper 154 ("NAMCOT 118 +A0.D6.MIRR") - Same as mapper 88, except that bit 6 of $8000 controls single-screen mirroring (like A*ROM boards).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Tue Jul 03, 2007 10:32 am</p><hr />

Here you are my undestanding of the facts :<br /><br />- Nintendo released the famicom in Japan and allowed game companies to get games licenced for their console (in 1983)<br />- The famicom has a great sucess, so of course Namco wich is a big game company developped software for it (in ~1985)<br />- Very fastly Namco wasn't satisfacted with the NROM configurations, and were one of the first company to devlopp other mappers<br />- Namco made their own custom chips, all labelled 10x for their famicom games (I'm not sure if they are even manufactured by Namco or not)<br />- One of those chips appear to be the 108 or 109, I assume the 109 is a small revision of the 108. They happen to allow great possibilities (for their time), including bankswitching of very small CHR ROM banks and PRG ROM banks (in 1986)<br />- This inspired Nintendo to devlopp their own different chip to use in their cartridges, the MMC1. Any other game company developping software but not manufacturing cartridges was invited to use this chip as well for their games (in 1987)<br />- As many games using the N108/109 were sucessfull, Namco decided to port them to the states. However, nobody were officially allowed to make their own cartridge for the NES, only for the famicom (including Namco).<br />- As all Nintendo made mappers, including the just-released MMC1 didn't have much of the 108/109 possibilities, Namco succeded to persuade Nintendo to made cartridge boards accepting their 108/109 chip. (Nintendo called them DEROM for some reason)<br />- Tengen collaborated with Namco somehow, and ported Gauntlet on the NES using the famous N109 chip and using 4-screen mirroring. Nintendo released this on another cartridge board called DRROM.<br />- Tengen and Nintendo has entered in war : As a result, Tengen begin to made their own unlicenced cartridges with their own lockout chip.<br />- Tengen wanted to release their own cartridge with the N109 chip as well, and developped/ported it to the MIMIC-1 wich is pretty much the same chip.<br />- Nintendo continued to release a few N109 made cartridge, but probably their supply of 109 ran out or something, and they found the chip interesting. So, they developped their MMC3 based on the 109 with a lot of improvements and new features. This will allow them to release games using the N109 with boards using the brand new MMC3 as well (Gaunlet for example).<br />- Tengen themsevles weren't satisfacted with the possibilities of the N109 (called MIMIC-1) any longer as well, so they developped their own MMC3-based chip (they got the wokings of the MMC3 in a way or another) with a few different features here and there, with an internal CIC, called RAMBO-1.<br />- Tengen reconciliated with Nintendo and all<br />- Romhackers started to dump NES and famicom cartridges.<br />- They assigned MMC3 cartridges to mapper 4.<br />- They did notice the carts with the N109, the MIMIC-1 were working in a very similar way as the MMC3, and they throught it would be simpler to assign all of these simply to mapper 4.<br />- A few games does not quite work just as well with mapper 4.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Jul 03, 2007 5:18 am</p><hr />

Tengen's MIMIC-1 is the same as Namco 109, isn't it? (Except that the former has an added lockout-defeat circuit built in.) Kevin Horton's mapper page seems to indicate this (see, for instance, <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/nes_custom/NES_DRROM.html" class="postlink">the DRROM description page</a>, which treats the two as synonomous). That would seem to indicate that a lot of common Tengen games, such as both licensed and unlicensed versions of RBI Baseball, should also be reassigned away from mapper #4.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=110">Josh</a> — Mon Jul 02, 2007 4:08 pm</p><hr />

I just looked up Karnov in Nestopia's database, and it is classified under mapper 206 (CRC 548A2C3C).  A quick DB scan shows several other m206 entries in the DB, though I don't know what games they are (I'm assuming they're other Namco-109 / MIMIC-1 games).<br /><br />BootGod, I recommend changing Namco-109 games to mapper 206 in your DB.  Nestopia is by no means the only emulator acknowledging this mapper designation.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Mon Jul 02, 2007 2:26 pm</p><hr />

Since a WRAM value of $00 defaults to one WRAM bank for backward compatibility, I'm going to recommend to Marat that a value of $FF (-1) be interpreted as zero and that this be published in the official spec. That would fix Low G Man.<br /></div><br /><br />That is a good idea to use FF, but why bother Marat?  He seceeded leadership in NES emulation years ago.  The cutting edge is here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Sun Jul 01, 2007 5:40 pm</p><hr />

According to BootGod's database, Karnov is on the board NES-DE1ROM-01.  According to the Nestopia source, DE1ROM is mapper 206.  The implementation of mapper 206 in Nestopia is identical to mapper 4 except that writes to $A000-FFFF are ignored (this is NOT actual Namco-109 behavior, but it may be what's needed to fix Karnov).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Sun Jul 01, 2007 4:58 pm</p><hr />

For my best, this question has no answer. Sounds MAMEished, but come on... we're developing an hardware emulator that <em>supposely</em> can load and play those games, as being homebrew or commercial, since there's no way of blocking them. Well, if you're worried about a specific game and its emulation, fair enough - you're worried with the cartridge board itself, since the program data just do the task.<br /><br />Anyway, that's me... ^_^;;<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Sun Jul 01, 2007 4:44 pm</p><hr />
