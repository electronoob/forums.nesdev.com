		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey all.  Well, I want to get back into it and do up a new game engine, but this time I want to have some more elements come into play.
<br />
<br />The main thing I'm wondering about is some acceleration and deceleration when it comes to moving across various terrains.  What I want to have would be your typical solid tile, but also ice blocks and sludge (water that's hard to move in).
<br />
<br />For the ice, I wanted to try and copy the physics of it taking some time to get to speed while walking, but if you were to jump and land and be moving forward, you are already at speed.  When you let go of the button, there'd be some deceleration as you slide forward.  Again, jumping could cancel this.  It seems like it'd just be having some var count to some number until it reaches a max, but the real trick would come if you turned around.  On normal ground, you'd just be immediatley moving in the opposite direction with no deceleration happening.  With ice, you'd slide, decelerate, then accelerate in the opposite direction.  It seems like ice will need a few exceptions....
<br />
<br />I don't know.  Has anyone tried doing ice mechanics before and could tell me if I'm not seeing something that could be easier?
<br />
<br />The sludge is another one that'll be fun, but we'll save that for later.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />

<br />
<br />Instead of adding a velocity factor when I go right and removing when I go left, I would always add the velocity factor. The only difference is the velocity must be positive when going right and negative when going left.
<br />
<br />When I would be on ice, if the player change direction (from right to left), instead of resetting the velocity to 0, I would add negative velocity to the current value. This way, even though the player would be facing left, he would still be moving right for a certain amount of time.
<br />
<br />Maybe there is some easier way. Like I said, I'm just think out loud now. That was more fun to think about that then my current task at work at the moment (shhh... don't say anybody <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />)

<br />I don't think Bregalad is talking out of frustration for not completing his game, as I seem to remember he has no intention of selling it (at least not exclusively).
<br />
<br />To some extent I think he has a point, it's like a person <strong>gives</strong> me the recipe for some cookies and then I try to <strong>sell</strong> the cookies I made back to that person. It's not right.
<br />
<br />The situation is not exactly like that though, because Sivak has to modify the recipes quite a lot before coming up with a product, and even though it's in a sort of mercenary kind of way he's still contributing to the homebrew scene. He's helping to expand a market we all (NES developers) hope to get a piece of eventually, so while we can't come up with our own games, at least Sivak is keeping the market warm.
<br />
<br />I guess this is how I see it, so I don't think it's so bad that he's making money out of knowledge he gets for free (I'm still not a big fan of that, but it doesn't outrage me anymore).

C.) the fact that no one bitched about the same issues when bunnyboy released "glider" makes me think the only reason people are angry about this is the fact that they just wanted to play battlekid....for free.

<br />
<br />For ice, it's been done a number of ways. The usual NES approach has been something like what you described, where jumping could kill your forward momentum, landing while moving would keep you going with an exceedingly low deceleration, and manual acceleration (walking/running) was cat down by a hefty amount from usual amount.
<br />
<br />Basically, for your usual platformer, the set of variables in play:
<br />
<br />Current velocity
<br />Max velocity
<br />Ice walk/run acceleration
<br />Normal walk/run acceleration
<br />Normal decel
<br />Ice decel
<br />Jump walk/run acceleration
<br />
<br />Accel affects current velocity depending on direction and ground/ice/air status.
<br />Velocity is capped at +/- max
<br />Net accel = cur accel +/- decel, depending on directions, etc

<br />I don't know if I speak for everyone here, but IMO opinion Battle Kid is the first game in a long time to show some evolution in the level of homebrew complexity, so it's only natural that it gathers more attention than the old and overdone minigame/puzzle games.
<br />
<br />We still have a long way to go, after all Battle Kid is still a single screen <strong>at a time</strong> game, it only happens to have a LOT of screens. =)
<br />
<br />But yeah, I'm still not sure what to think about this whole issue. Sivak's contributions to the community are indirect. He's helping to keep the general interest in homebrew alive, but he isn't showing much gratitude to his fellow developers who helped him get to where he's now.
<br />
<br />Like I said, this is a difficult issue. I think it's hard to say what is right or wrong here, because of the weird way the retro scene works. We're used to getting things for free, as all those awesome games from the 80's and 90's are just one click away. But when it comes to new content, it's hard for experienced people to find the time to make games, so it's only natural that they seek for a form of compensation.
<br />
<br />I for example have had so much work the last few weeks that I couldn't touch my personal projects at all. But I have to make money in order to live, so I'll either work on other stuff and have no time for homebrewing or I'll charge for my games. That is, I must charge for my time, so if people want games from me they'll have to pay for that time, or there will be no games. It's complicated.
