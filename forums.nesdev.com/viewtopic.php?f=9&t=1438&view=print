		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I have just come in posession of a famicom clone, I opened it up expecting a NOAC but there's a proper NES setup, a PPC, a CPU, wram, vram(?) and the other logic chips. The PPC and CPU are removable so I might try to plug a official one in there later.
<br />
<br />But for the time being, it's got a 60pin connector. I want to wire up a 72 pin connector, however, i'm unsure where the extra connections would go. would they go directly to the cpu/ppu or isn't it possible to make that conversion?
<br />
<br />(I'll post pictures later!)

<br />I'm pretty sure that the trouble maker is the CIC that's in the console. Since your console does not have one, it doesn't matter whether the cart has one or not.
<br />
<br />I don't know if it's pins should just be left unconnected though, but that would be my guess.

<br />No NES mappers implement this, and only a few Super NES mappers (e.g. SA-1) implement this.

The CIC in regular SNES games is the exact same as in regular NES games, with the exeption that japannese SFC games have a CIC too, unlike FC games that doesn't. I think an additionnal variant of the CIC was made for Japan.

<br />NOAC debuted with Super 8, anything after 1994 or so is game. Micro Genius I believe still makes discrete clones, they likely don't manufacture the parts however, just use the NOS.
<br />
<br />joe78, just leave the nonexistant pins disconnected, CIC is irrelevant to Famicom. Better yet, buy a 72-&gt;60 adapter from Liksang or somebody, it will be easier than soldering 60 wires and infinitely more sturdy.
