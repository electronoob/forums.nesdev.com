Such a program plays its song and listens on the input registers for commands to play sound effects or to load the next song. This is all game-specific, although some games may use the same programs and commands because they're from the same company or because the companies used the same audio library.<br /><br />The audio hardware only outputs audio, no status info. You may get that by creating your own SPC700 program that returns that info upon request.

Every game uploads its own special program into the SPC700's CPU; any given program will do something different.<br /><br />(For example, Super Mario World and Super Metroid both treat writes to different ports as &quot;change track&quot; and &quot;play sound effect&quot;. Other games may use different ports, or an entirely different abstraction. The &quot;undumped&quot; SNES soundtracks generally put something resembling a &quot;dumb&quot; hardware synth in the SPC700 and the SNES's CPU triggers notes.)<br /><br />Additionally, the SPC700 is limited to a total of 64 KiB of RAM for all the compressed samples, all code, and, if desired, an uncompressed echo buffer. While the SNES's CPU can change what samples are present (assuming the SPC700's CPU cooperates), you're still limited to 64 KiB at any given time: you're not going to get to play arbitrary samples from arbitrary games simultaneously.

The SPC700 doesn't run 6502 machine code per se, but its instruction set is about 98% source compatible with 6502 assembly.

Tales of Phantasia, on the other hand, streamed its vocals during the opening, if memory serves me correctly.

This means that when the CPU writes to addresses in the range $2140-$2143, the SPC700 is selected, and the value in one of the SPC700's four input registers ($00F4-$00F7) is changed. Audio driver code is supposed to listen for requests by reading these input registers and then write back a status value once the driver has finished processing the request.<br /><br />See also <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/fullsnes.htm#snesaudioprocessingunitapu" class="postlink">APU specs in Fullsnes</a>.

You can use HDMA if you know what you're doing, but it requires timed code and careful synchronization, and as far as I know it's only ever been used in one homebrew game (N-Warp Daisakusen); mostly games just have the main CPU transfer data manually.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">and when SNES boot and connect game PCB , it need return bootstrap code ?</div><br />The main CPU starts execution in ROM, at a location specified by the RESET vector (also in ROM).<br /><br />The SPC700 starts execution in an IPL ROM built into the sound module.  This 64-byte boot ROM specifies an initial communication protocol on the SPC700 side, and the main CPU must be programmed to transfer at least the initial bits of game-specific code/data through the four audio I/O ports using this protocol.  If you want to use a different communication protocol, you have to first upload the SPC700 code for it using the IPL ROM protocol.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">because new model of SNES the SPC700 module is onboard , so it need control from game PCB card ...</div><br />No.  It works exactly the same in all models.
