This thread shall not be about movies like &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; or &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. I'm talking about movies where video games themselves are prominently featured.<br /><br />Also, please no movies that deal only with fictional games that were invented specifically for the movie. No &quot;Tron&quot; or &quot;Gamer&quot;.<br /><br />And no documentaries like &quot;The King of Kongs&quot; please.<br /><br />If you know a TV series or something like that which deals with the topic, it would be alright as well. As long as video games are not just a topic of one single episode.<br /><br />O.k., let me start with the ones that I know:<br /><br />&quot;The Wizard&quot;<br />Explanation should be needless.<br /><br />&quot;Arcade Gamer Fubuki&quot;<br />Silly anime series (four episodes, self-contained) with lots of panty shots. Many real-world Sega games are featured.<br /><br />&quot;Joysticks&quot;<br />Movie about people who hang out at an arcade. Various games are shown to be played.<br /><br />&quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;<br />The main games that are featured are made-up, but the movie contains enough real-world games to be listed here.<br /><br />So, what other movies do you know?

The black humor is a bit over the top for some people, but really cracks me up. Don't know how well the Swedish comedy style translates to English-speaking countries, but check it out if you can find subtitles for it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Donkey Kong runs on the Radar Scope (MAME: dkong.c) board. Nintendo is reportedly have been inspired to make the Famicom by the pixel perfection of the ColecoVision port of Donkey Kong. So the Vs. System, which is nearly identical to the Famicom in behavior, would be at least as valid for the Fix-It franchise as Radar Scope. In fact, Donkey Kong 3 uses a pair of NES CPUs, one to make music and one to make samples.<br /><br />This leaves Disney as the obstacle to a homebrew Fix-It game. And for the same reason, real games shown as games in a commercial movie that's not a documentary would usually mean product placement.
