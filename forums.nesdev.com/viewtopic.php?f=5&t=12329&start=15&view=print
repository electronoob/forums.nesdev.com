That day, 2 choices available - Master System and <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_System" class="postlink">Phantom System</a>, a NES clone made by <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGB_Eletr%C3%B4nica" class="postlink">Gradiente</a>. For some reason that faded away of my mind, my choice was the Phantom System. It came with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdZmiyPaKkA" class="postlink">Ghostbusters game</a>, by Activision. Heh, my first words was... &quot;it's pretty much a upgraded Atari 2600&quot;. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I lived in an apartment complex, and a boy lived with his mother in another build. He had another NES clone and we were friends. Thanks to him, I could play classic titles like Rockman, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgzWdOKkNbI" class="postlink">Rambo</a>, Duck Tales, Adventure Island... specially Rockman. Golden times. Heh, who plays Rambo for more than 12 hours with no breaks nowadays?

I've heard of developers taking advantage of the cartridge medium and quickly changing textures mid game, something that couldn't be done on the PlayStation without small loading times here and there. I'd say see Metal Slug on the PlayStation, but that port is sh*t. (How could they possibly not replicate a game on 4 year older hardware?) I always thought the problem with the N64 was the low amount of polygons, companies like Rare and Factor 5 soon got their act together. I personally think that the PlayStation gives the N64 a run for it's money, but the N64 still looks better over all.

The city in the background on the PlayStation version is one big flat texture, while on the N64, it appears to be several distinct shapes. I think the boats are also have more polygons than the ones on the PlayStation by a bit. I also think the blurry textures look more natural here, because both games seem to use the same size textures. I don't know if the PlayStation version was nerfed for the N64, but I doubt it.

I know this sounds a bit ballsy, but I almost think that the N64 version kind of serves as a bridge between the PlayStation and the Dreamcast versions.

(Basically, quality over quantity.) Again, this is only my opinion.

Duh, instant access to a huge amount memory. That's what arcade systems had even over that generation. PS wasn't designed for that level of 2D, and the NeoGeo was (and later with mappers).

Even then, looking at that examples - I don't see sharper or more detailed textures on the n64 version. What I see, is what I was saying before (vaseline). 3D isn't really my strong point, but I know enough to understand where the limitation of the n64 lays (thanks to someone else's analysis <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ); it has more of a penalty hit for accessing textures outside the texture cache than the PS1 or Saturn. Which is why games were designed with simplistic and small textures (and IIRC, overlaying them) to keep the texture access in cache as much as possible. Maybe the n64 had a higher poly count, but didn't look like it back then nor does it now. I have not real stake in this argument, because I think 3D from that generation sucks (including n64. each for their own reasons). There are only a few games I can play from that generation because of this (and yet NES graphics look beautiful to me).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">About what you said about games, this is my personal opinion: The PlayStation has more (being quantity) good games, but the good games on the N64 are generally better than the good games on the PlayStation.

Outside of maybe 3-4 n64, and I can't think of any that I even care about. And out of the 3-4, that includes OoT and M64 (but not MM, I hate that game).

The fact is that the textures on both the PlayStation and the N64 are the same size. I think the N64 one looks better because even though the textures are the same, the textures are smoothened, even if they are blurrier. And about the whole screen having the &quot;Vaseline&quot; over it, I've gotten used to it. (I know that's not the answer you are looking for.) To me, it's almost like a cheep way to try to make the graphics look &quot;better&quot; but I don't know if the screen is blurred because they wanted to do it or not.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">it has more of a penalty hit for accessing textures outside the texture cache than the PS1 or Saturn.</div><br />But it's also faster. Also, I thought the N64 would have had the easiest time here because it loads it from a cartridge instead of a disk.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Maybe the n64 had a higher poly count, but didn't look like it back then nor does it now.</div><br />As much as I'd like to say otherwise, I have to agree. (mostly) It's kind of weird, but I think that the PlayStation had better looking games when the N64 came out, but I think the N64 eventually started beating the PlayStation late in its life. (Thanks to people like Rare and Factor 5.)<br /><br />Here's an article from Wikipedia about the N64 I feel like showing: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64_programming_characteristics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_6 ... cteristics</a><!-- m --><br /><div class="quotetitle">Wikipedia wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">SGI's default microcode for Nintendo 64 is called &quot;Fast3D&quot;, which some developers noted was poorly profiled for use in games. Although it allows more than 100,000 high accuracy polygons per second, this microcode is optimized more for accuracy than for speed, and performance may suffer as a result. Nintendo's own &quot;Turbo3D&quot; microcode allows 500,000–600,000 normal accuracy polygons per second. However, due to the graphical degradation, Nintendo officially discouraged its use. Several companies, such as Factor 5,[3] Boss Game Studios and Rare, were able to write custom microcode that reportedly runs their game engines better than SGI's standard microcode would</div><br />I really don't care how &quot;bad&quot; the polygons look, If I had to choose between 100,000 or 500,000–600,000 polygons, you bet I'll go for the one that's got 5-6x as much, even if they are only &quot;normal accuracy&quot; (Whatever that even means.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">There are only a few games I can play from that generation because of this (and yet NES graphics look beautiful to me).</div><br />I think that's a bit of a stretch. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> I think 2D graphics became &quot;beautiful&quot; around the 16-bit consoles, (PCE might as well be.) but everyone's got their own opinion. Out of the three, I personally think the Genesis looks the ugliest out of the three because it kind of got a double whammy when it comes to colors. The PCE has a lot of colors onscreen, the SNES has a lot of colors total, and the Genesis has neither. (And has even less colors onscreen than the SNES.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Sure, that's subjective, but that's usually what it comes down to anyway. Outside of maybe 3-4 n64, and I can't think of any that I even care about. And out of the 3-4, that includes OoT and M64 (but not MM, I hate that game).</div><br />I can think of about 6-8 really good N64 games (with about 3-4 being some of my &quot;all-time&quot; favorite games) 12 games that I like but not as much, about 4 PlayStation games I like as much as the really good N64 games and about 20 other good but not as good games. About Majora's Mask, I never really liked it either. Some people act like it's the holy grail or something, but I like Ocarina of Time better but I definitely wouldn't call it &quot;the best game ever&quot;. I like a Link to the Past better.<br /><br />To sum it up, this is how I see both consoles: The PlayStation is more well rounded and just designed better overall, and even though the N64 was more powerful, it was a bit more poorly designed than the PlayStation. Basically, even though the N64 was quite a bit more powerful, the PlayStation didn't look much worse and was still a good competitor. It kind of reminds me of the GameCube vs. the original Xbox (The fact that I have to say original is just ridiculous.) with the GameCube being the PlayStation and the Xbox being the N64. For the longest time, I actually thought the GameCube was more powerful.

At this time there wasn't much techinfo available but rumours claimed this Y0Shi guy had his nestech.txt with all sorts of valuable information. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />I contacted him but he declined to give me the info unless I had some kind of proof we were developing a NES emulator. I am not sure about the reason for this.. Anyway, we didn't have a properly working emulator at that time but when we had something working I got back to this guy and finally got access to the document. It was located on some sort of secret-server. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

I got my first video game console, the Gameboy Advance SP, along with several games that I have so many memories of, most fondly with a port of Donkey Kong Country. This was my first introduction to Nintendo.<br /><br />Sometime later I was going through stuff in my basement and came across another game console made by, hold up...Nintendo? Apparently my dad had bought a SNES which I remember thinking was weird since he would have been a few years out of college by the time it was released. I didn't consider that adults played video games.<br /><br />He had gotten 2 games for it. Super Mario World and Super Star Wars. SMW I remember a lot more fondly because it actually had a save feature and well, it's Super Mario World. Along with finding the SNES I also found a book of the official Nintendo player's guide, which said it had in depth reviews of something like over 90 NES Games<br /><br />This was the first I had heard of an NES. I figured that it must be the predecessor to the Super Nintendo.<br /><br />So I looked back in the basement and lo and behold, I found my dad's old NES too.<br /><br />Unfortunately nobody in my family could figure out how to make it work. I guess my dad forgot how. So we ended up getting rid of it. We kept the games though. In hindsight, it may have actually worked, and just wasn't comptatible with any of our TVs, but whatever.<br /><br />A couple of years pass and I begin to grow more and more interested in the NES, mostly because nobody my age that I'd met at the time knew what the heck an NES was. Eventually I learn about GameXchange, which still sells retro games. So we went there to buy something that could play NES games and was compatible with a modern day television (anything that wasn't RCA frightened me.)<br /><br />I played Metroid, Zelda, Mario, Tetris, Mario 2, Zelda 2, and a few others. I gradually expanded my collection, and have been in love with the NES ever since.<br /><br />So yeah. Not really nostalgic in the sense that I didn't grow up during the 8 bit era, but it was my childhood, so it's nostalgic to me.

I know every console goes through something like this, but it seemed especially prevalent on the NES. Also, the music in the Solstice game is pretty cool. The beginning parts of it almost remind me of the quieter songs in Doom. (The ones with the levels  that you get easily lost in.)<br /><br />You know, just looking at the game, how the heck is the character partially behind and in front of the background like that? Behind them, there's more than one color, so it can't be something with color 0. (Watch the character walk behind spikes.)
