Actually, there was an idea to make next loops with more difficult levels, by putting more characters on the existing levels - more different level layouts would be really difficult to design because of limited screen space. You can see it in the source code that there was support for few characters per level initially. I can't recall the exact reason why I decided to not do it. One of reasons was lack of free PRG memory, and CHR was filled up too, so no extra characters. NROM was set as an intentional limitation, you know, to have a point where the project should be finished - otherwise it could be extended indefinitely.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Thu May 17, 2012 9:28 pm</p><hr />

Well, I was thinking more in terms of games like Door Door and Wrecking Crew, but I see what you mean now that you bring those two specific games up. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Still though, even though DK and Popeye only have a handful of stages, they'll repeat after you get through them all, and with each iteration, the challenge increases. Once you get through the work week in this game, you're dumped back to the title screen.<br /><br />If you'd like me to imagine this game along side DK and Popeye, I need to pretend that this is a faithful NES port of an arcade game. In that case, you've done a good job with the overall aesthetic and the gameplay itself, but I get hung up on the fact that the game just completely ends after 7 stages, instead of doing what those other games would have done, and repeated them with a shorter time limit or something.<br /><br />Again, <em>this is a good game</em>, but I think it could've gone a bit farther. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> If you ever decide to revisit this concept, I'd be interested in seeing it. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Thu May 17, 2012 9:15 pm</p><hr />

This is a very nice game, but I think it could use some more stages. Most NES games that are in a style like this will have more than 7 stages. Please take this into consideration if you ever decide to put this on a cart.<br /><br />The factoids are a cool touch, but in the later stages, the action is just too frantic for me to actually stop and read them, and after a while, I actually forgot they were even there.<br /><br />The gameplay is great, it only took a few moments for me to figure out how to successfully play! Just as a note though, I didn't know you could wrap around the screen until the suggestively-placed vertical ladders, and even then, it still took me a while to figure out you could wrap horizontally too.<br /><br />Graphics are sparse, but they're very effective and they do a good job making the game look nice.<br /><br />Music and sound worked... I don't know what else to say about it, it didn't sound out of place; even the ringing phones didn't get on my nerves, so that's a job well done there. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Overally, good job, but I <em>really</em> wish there were more stages. However, if you add more stages, you'll probably need to think of some more gimmicks to keep the game fresh. Given that the game takes place in an office environment, I think you'd have a goldmine of inspiration at your disposal. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21">Drag</a> — Thu May 17, 2012 8:39 pm</p><hr />
