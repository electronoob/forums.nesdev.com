EPROMS are going away forever and will not return.  It is already getting hard to find old/new stock of certain sizes.  Like 8 track tapes, if you liked them, you better go get them now, going, going gone.....forever.  I'm not crying about it, just stating a fact.  And while I'm there Nintendo on a chip?  90% there is still 90% if you are a fan, you know and if you don't know now you know.  Close counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, not audio.  Sorry, pretty picky about that last one.

Flash is cheaper and better anyways if you can shift way from 32pin DIPs.

The die plans of most Chinese manufacturers are all going surface mount.  Will you be able to find them in 10 years, sure, but at what price.  If recent years are any indicator, expect to pay.   As the demand goes down for any component, you find the same thing.  Look at prices for through hole RF chokes for instance.  Ridiculous!

Time is the biggest investment.  You just need someone with the skills to be interested in developing it.  The trick at that point is to take the necessary (often negelected) step of taking it to market.  How does kevtris' APU stack up against the NES's?  I'm sure it's next to flawless, or could be if he was motivated to make it so.  The gap that's really missing is getting his NOAC to market which has it's own set of hurdles.  I suppose that's where the biggest financial hurdle is, taking the little piggy to market.  Hard to say what that cost would be exactly, depends greatly on how one were to do it.
