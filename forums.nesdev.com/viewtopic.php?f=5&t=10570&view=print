		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What would you say are the most famous or most popular PC games from the start of PC gaming until the mid-90s?<br /><br />The games have to be games that were natively created for the PC. If it's a port of a console or arcade game, it doesn't count.<br />Maybe a little exception: If the arcade or console game was some totally obscure game and it was only due to the PC version that it got famous, this might count as well.<br />All in all, the game had to be famous <em>on the PC</em>. (Please don't name &quot;Pac-Man&quot; or &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; just because they had PC ports.)<br /><br />I will start the list with &quot;Doom&quot;.<br /><br />What others do you know that were really <em>the</em> most famous old school PC games?

Although it wasn't natively created for MS-DOS PC, it only got the fame when it has been ported to it.<br /><br />Warcraft and C&amp;C also could be in the list, at least the first Warcraft (1994). Heroes of Might and Magic, maybe (1995).

If the former, Number Munchers. If the latter, Number Munchers and The Oregon Trail are ports from Apple II. In any case, Tetris and Block Out both began on PC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I do like the controls in Apogee/MicroFX's <em>Pharaoh's Tomb</em> and <em>Arctic Adventure</em> (left shift = move left, right shift = move right, space = jump (fixed height), any key between the two shift keys on the same row = shoot) far better than the more modern games; too bad other games don't use those control schemes! (These games do allow the arrow keys to move too, and F to shoot, although I prefer the shift keys to move and others on the same row to shoot) (Fixed jump height is also a feature I like)<br /><br />I did play other games from Apogee Software, such as <em>Paganitzu</em>, <em>Hocus Pocus</em> (although I think it is too easy, even on hard mode), and several others; I forget what all of them are at this time. ZZT (by Potomac Computer Systems) is not bad (I have even managed to figure out a lot of stuff about it by observation, so can pretty much guess exactly why it does certain strange things), and the games included with it are actually pretty good except that they seem to be a bit too easy in my opinion.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's hard to pick a &quot;top 10&quot; that everyone will agree on. But I agree with almost all the games everyone else has named in this thread.<br />They're not terribly good games, but I have a soft spot in my heart for the other EGA platformers that were made by Apogee between Commander Keen 1-3 and 4-6, like Crystal Caves, Secret Agent, and the original Duke Nukem.<br />Kroz and ZZT are very formative games, so I'd recommend taking a gander; don't feel obliged to play through them, though.<br /><br />Not exactly related, but I really like the version of the soundtrack for Lemmings and Lemmings 2 on machines with the SN76489.
