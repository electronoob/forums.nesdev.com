I'm undecided on the style. Dragon Quest-like? (4-directions) Or still images?<br />This simple sort of layout is roughly what the map generation will produce.<br /><br />I'm currently doing some low-level benchmark tests, in C.

I was studying how several games encode/decode their password data, and I could apply an offset to the generation seed, whenever the player goes up or down a floor, using a shift byte. Seed generation can create the same data, if done properly.<br /><br />Speaking of--<br />The seed will be displayed on-screen to the player, on dying/completing the game.<br />Because a community playing rogue-likes and exchanging difficult map seeds, is something I miss dearly.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Myask wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">&quot;fully-functional&quot; could mean a lot of things, unfortunately.</div><br /><br />In the case of my rogue-like, by fully functional, I mean that it will use seed generation, and the entirety of floors will be generated by the seed. <br /><br />Room &quot;patterns&quot; (pre-built rooms) will be used very scarcely.
