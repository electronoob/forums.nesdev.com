Can't speak for everyone else, but that's just a natural experience if that's what you have. <br />Then there's these wonderful glitch/speed run streams that wouldn't be if it weren't for PAL/NTSC discrepancies.<br /><br />Still, in the shoes of a developer, you might simply want to do it because you're something of a perfectionist and want everybody to have a near-same experience of what you've made. And as a consumer of homebrew, i'd recognize and appreciate the effort. It's part the fun to know that what you're playing is someones' labour of love, and this is one of many ways to express that.

This is only possible for very simple games that require just about half of the CPU time for every given frame.<br /><br />So, yeah, the output itself can be either way around. But it's about calculating the game logic here.<br />This one is mundane if PAL is the master version: You simply skip game logic altogether every sixth frame on NTSC.<br />But if NTSC is the master version, then PAL has to process two game logic steps every fifth frame.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wouldn't do the same thing for every game.<br /><br />If it was menu/turn based, like a strategic thing, it would be relatively easy to change the timings for PAL in a way that didn't affect the game. In this case it's only a detriment that the PAL version plays slower, so it's worth speeding up. (Of course, a lot of things have to go frame-by-frame for smoothness anyway, so some things you just can't speed up properly.)<br /><br />If it's a platformer, I would normally prefer the 5/6 slower version, so that all the physics stay exactly the same on a frame-to-frame basis and the mechanics are otherwise identical except for the speed. Like even if you calculate a trajectory that's &quot;the same&quot; at the new speed, the actual points you pass through on the arc of the jump are going to be different-- the peaks and tolerances are all moved by this, and it's compounded for every part of the system you adjust the speed for (each enemy, etc.) -- it's a really big change! You have to fully test and tune two games to do it properly.<br /><br />Speed does affect difficulty, but reaction times are highly variable between humans (not to mention TVs and lag) and hopefully your game's challenge isn't really based on how fast you react (Punch Out is a bad game, IMO). If it's a bit more important &quot;what&quot; you do than &quot;how fast you reacted&quot;, it might make sense that a 5/6 slowdown isn't as big a change as simulating the physics with different precision? If your game IS mostly based on reaction time, though, you probably SHOULD adjust the timings for PAL... but I personally am wary about that kind of game to begin with.<br /><br />Streemerz took the approach to target PAL and just display every 5th frame twice on NTSC. This results in the expected judder and I also thought it hurt input response. As I recall thefox said he wouldn't have done this for any other game, it was just that it was a port of a Flash game that was 50hz originally and he wanted it to match exactly.<br /><br /><br />Music of course I'd adjust the speed of in either case, though. That's a given.

Basically you're wasting a lot of RAM and ROM in your cart to accomodate for PAL and NTSC systems. The correct approach is to make your ROM as small as possible and not waste RAM, and make the cart run correctly on either region, and then do another ROM which is ported to the other region.<br /><br />Things that should be corrected in order of priority from most important to least important are:<br /><ul><li>Raster effects fixed to look OK</li><li>Music pitch adjusted</li><li>Music tempo adjusted</li><li>Gameplay speed variables adjusted</li><li>Non-gameplay animations adjusted</li></ul><br />Most comercially released PAL NES games only fixed the first point, or the first 3 points at the very best.

Everybody else doesn't care anyway.<br /><br />But if I ever come across one of those people, I would ask them why they desire a speed adjustment in one little game, even though the vast majority of the existing games they use doesn't have this either and they still play the slower versions.

They both animate certain things on a 10 Hz timer.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I cannot believe that people seriously suggest a way that basically makes the PAL version the original master version while the NTSC version would be the inferior hackjob.</div><br />More countries used PAL 50 Hz or SECAM than NTSC or PAL-M. <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=193832#p193832" class="postlink">Oziphantom's previous post</a> mentioned <a href="http://static.diffen.com/uploadz/thumb/f/ff/PAL-NTSC.svg/610px-PAL-NTSC.svg.png" class="postlink">this diagram</a>, which I admit is slightly misleading because it groups Brazil's PAL-M with PAL rather than with NTSC, whose timings it more closely resembles. But 50 Hz (green plus orange minus Brazil) still covers a lot more of the world than 60 Hz (blue plus Brazil). And even if you consider area misleading, I <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=193857#p193857" class="postlink">counted countries by population</a>, and PAL 50 Hz and SECAM outnumbered NTSC and PAL-M there as well.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">GradualGames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Oh wait, I understand the 10fps approach...interesting. That'd be super slow animations though wouldn't it?</div><br />Not necessarily. Traditional cel animation is &quot;on twos&quot;, which is 12 fps at the North American 24 fps rate or 12.5 fps at the European 25 fps rate. If all the actors have velocities 20% bigger on PAL than on NTSC, and they change cel once every 5 frames on NTSC or once every 4 frames on PAL, you'll end up with the same smoothness as &quot;on twos&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Since the NES is a Japanese console and had a much wider release in NTSC regions than for PAL</div><br />Are there more PAL famiclones than authentic PAL NES consoles? PAL famiclones such as the Dendy generate 312 lines every 50 Hz, like a PAL NES. But they NMI 21 lines before picture start like an NTSC NES, and the CPU:PPU ratio is 3:1 like an NTSC NES. So my games that compensate for PAL (<em>Thwaite</em> and <em>RHDE</em>) make the same compensations on Dendy as on PAL NES (actor velocities, skipping sixth frame of 10 Hz timer, music speed) except one: music pitch.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hojo_Norem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">On a more conversational note, does anybody know of any PAL exclusive titles that made use of the PAL NES's greater vertical screen resolution and increased vblank time to a point where they couldn't be converted to NTSC? Perhaps some extreme edge cases?</div><br /><em>Asterix</em> and <em>The Smurfs</em> are the best known cases.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">My approach is to simply store a global value saying whether the clock speed is NTSC or PAL/Dendy</div><br />Basically you're wasting a lot of RAM and ROM in your cart to accomodate for PAL and NTSC systems.</div><br />I don't see one byte of RAM as &quot;a lot&quot;. As for ROM, it doesn't take a lot of bytes to wrap (say) the tempo upcounter at 3000 instead of 3606. In any case, it'd &quot;waste&quot; a lot less ROM than storing both a complete NTSC version and a complete PAL version of the game in each cartridge.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">DRW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">To me, adjusting the speed for PAL makes only sense in one specific case: When you have PAL players who desire to play the game at the correct speed, but on their unmodded PAL console. Everybody else doesn't care anyway.</div><br />Or when you want to deter someone from cheating his way to a high score by playing the NTSC ROM at PAL speed.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Just my opinion:</strong><br /><br />Here's how I'd make a dual NTSC/PAL game, based largely on my experience with <em>Thwaite</em>:<br /><br /><ul><li>Run much of the game engine at 10 Hz, such as advancing sprites to the next cel of animation. This can help with enemy AI as well, as spreading the enemies' think cycles over five frames can seriously ease processing.</li><li>Increase actors' velocities by 20% and accelerations by 44%. This will cause slight changes to trajectories, as rainwarrior mentioned and as top-level <em>Quake</em> series players exploit. Be sure to play-test your game in emulators at both speeds.</li><li>Increase music tempo. Pently expresses tempo in rows per minute, allowing it to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm" class="postlink">Bresenham algorithm</a> to accumulate rows in a variable until it crosses the platform's frames per minute value. Decreasing frames per minute from 3606 to 3000 keeps everything the same tempo, but I'll admit it gets on the nerve of hardcore 0CC-FamiTracker composers (who prefer to control tempo using a looping sequence of frames per row values, which 0CC-FT calls a &quot;groove&quot;).</li><li>On PAL NES (but not Dendy), transpose everything up one semitone. This should keep everything reasonably in tune unless you're using Sunsoft bass, and if you're using that, you should have enough PRG ROM for two period tables.</li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The thing is, GradualGames wants to make his game auto adjust for different systems.<br /><br />The first few posts are helpful comments on how this could be achieved...<br /><br />... then one comes along saying, in a nutshell &quot;Don't bother.  Code for NTSC.  PAL is crap.&quot;<br /><br />PAL is only crap because of the perception generated by the countless numbers of poor conversions ranging from meh to terribad (MM III, as was just demonstrated).<br /><br />Now I do get that gimping the NTSC experience isn't really the way to go, but do we need full 1:1 logic parity for a game running in PAL?  Perhaps I need to elaborate.<br /><br />I fully understand that a game written originally for NTSC can't be 100% faithfully converted to PAL without things like redrawing of animation frames, etc.  Or squeezing the game logic into the slower PAL frame.<br /><br />Actually, tepples hit it on the head as I was typing.  You don't need to get the game to run logic perfect at PAL speed, just adjust the physics to things move at the same speed in PAL as they do in NTSC.  It's not going to be perfect smooth, but hey, I was a PC gamer long before I had a job of my own.  I'm <em>used</em> to a little stutter in my games if I know there's a good reason for it.  <span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">I made that Celeron 300A and 3dfx Velocity gfx card <em>last</em> damn it!</span>

Rounding errors in fractional values can significantly change the gameplay from one version to the other... Things like acceleration and jump heights may be affected, and that's pretty dangerous.
