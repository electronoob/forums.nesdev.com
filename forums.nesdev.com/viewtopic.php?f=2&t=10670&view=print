The <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/aux4.php">http://www.infiniteneslives.com/aux4.php</a><!-- m --> page says &quot;upgrade to fully assembled (no soldering required) full flash boards, reprogrammable with our kazzo 'INL-retro' programmer via USB. Plug and Play!&quot;. And <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/aux3.php">http://www.infiniteneslives.com/aux3.php</a><!-- m --> is the programmer and ask you to select connector. Does that mean that if I buy one with 72 nes connector, I'll get appropriate INL-ROM v2 board?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To order a board with pre-populated flash you need to add both the board and the flash update to your cart, like this:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ztk5t2G.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And the programmer is sold separately. Please note that Linux and Windows 8 is not supported by the author, although I have ported the Anago dumper program to Linux and created a utility to flash a cart with the dumper for Linux. Also, I was able to get the author's software to work in Windows 8 using the Unsigned Driver installation procedure.<br /><br />This product is well known to the community. The author / manufacturer is a regular here (infiniteneslives), and the product has been under almost constant discussion in <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=7912" class="postlink">this thread</a>. You can find the above-mentioned Linux tools on page 17.<br /><br />This is by far the easiest and most well-supported way to get up and running with NES development, but do note that if you want to use this for making reproductions there are some gotcha's. Among them, only a certain set of mappers are supported (at this time Color Dreams, MMC1, MMC3 and FME7), and for a given mapper you will have to choose to use either CHR-RAM or CHR-ROM. These two choices will lock you into what games will be compatible with the board.<br /><br />Furthermore the size of the ROM chips you get with the board will also limit you in some cases. For instance, if you get a 256KB PRG-ROM board you can't load a game that uses 512KB of PRG-ROM. Another consideration is that with that same 256KB PRG-ROM board, if you want to load a game that only uses half that space you'll need to double the ROM yourself.<br /><br />Finally, the current version of the supplied software does not handle .nes files, only raw ROM files. You'll have to split your .nes files yourself.<br /><br />So yea, it's certainly the easiest way to do repros, but that's not really what it was designed for.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, well in that case, you still need to decide what mapper to use and whether to use CHR-ROM or CHR-RAM. My personal choice in this matter was to use MMC3 with 32KB CHR-RAM. This gives me flexible PRG-ROM banking, WRAM, the flexability of CHR-RAM and the ability to do graphical effects that require CHR banking. This configuration is also fairly well supported by currently developed emulators like Nintendualtor and FCEU.<br /><br />FME7 is also a very good choice for mapper, but I prefer MMC3's scan line counting IRQ over the FME7's CPU cycle counting IRQ. While technically more capable, I just don't like dealing with the extra complexity of the cycle counter.<br /><br />You can also still target NROM by using an initialization bank to set up the memory mapper to an NROM configuration and upload your CHR data into RAM. You can also do the same thing with other discrete mappers like UxROM if you move bank swapping code into a library routine, and the timing of the bank swaps aren't super-critical.<br /><br />INL-ROM board plus the INL-Retro programmer is by far the easiest way to develop apart from a PowerPak. Plus the PowerPak was several times more expensive and is no longer available from BunnyBoy.

I wanted to create something that allowed someone without soldering skills, hardware knowledge, or expensive tools necessary to publish their own game.  The EPROM version got things started to give options besides donors.  Now I'm working towards a full line up of fully assembled flashable boards (no soldering required).<br /><br />Nearly every mapper that was used in Nintendo licensed titles is supported with my boards.  There's room for custom options as well.  Although I've only got a small portion of what's possible listed for immediate checkout.  If there's something specific you're looking for you can always make requests.

Then no flashing equipment would be required, chr and prg would be stored on microSD either as .nes file (kinda like powerpak, but instead of menu, launching first .nes file in directory) or it will be stored by formatting microSD specifically using special program.<br /><br />You wouldn't need then any flashing equipment, only SD card reader (most of current PCs has one), microSD-&gt;SD adapter and a little know-how (far less than flashing).<br /><br />//edit: Also on microSD savefile could be located for mappers that support saving - no more faulty batteries!

But it's GOING to cost more and have several times the complexity for no good reason IMO.<br /><br />If you provide the rom (which you have rights to) at time of purchase I'll flash the boards for you for a fee that's much smaller than the cost of your requested hardware.<br /><br />As an aside I'm currently working on allowing the firmware to copy data from a SNES cart acting as temporary storage.  Once the rom image was loaded onto the SNES cart, you could operate without the PC completely.  Just provide power to the kazzo, plug in NES cart, hit reset, wait 10sec or less, done.  It really is easier and less work as a whole compared to using removable media.

Atleast that's what I assume you meant.<br /><br />I like the way the carts are now, there is no need for SD or other storage. If you want a cartridge like that, buy the EverDrive N8. These are nice as they are stand alone and basically operate exactly like original cartridges would.

You'll just connect pc via usb with cart (by means of USB port on cart itself), pretty much like you do with kazoo. Given it won't require connectors kazoo does, as power and data would go through USB cable into rom chips, it probably would be cheaper than cart+kazoo combined (though one could reflash cart after buying game, but it is their problem).

That'd require putting a USB device chipset and USB micro-B connector on each cart and joining USB-IF to get a vendor ID. It'd probably also involve paying for a kernel-mode code signing certificate to get a driver on Windows.
