Okay, I bought an official game cleaning kit a while back, and the tools inside were usefull. But the solution was just rubbing alcohol. I agree that Nintendo thought that people were technologicly inept, and didn't know anything, and they thought they could just tell people that you couldn't use rubbing alcohol. That's a bunch of crap. You can totally just clean it with rubbing alcohol. It came with a thing that you stick in the cart connecter, and it is thick, so it is kind of hard to push in, then you pull it out, and the dirt comes off on the thing when you pull it out. I was like 8 when I bought it, so I didn't know. But you know what cleans carts really well? Fold a 3 x 3 (or around that size) sticky note in half 4 times one way, and 1 time in half the other. Then stick it in between the pins and the plastic part, and slide it each way from one end to another a bunch of times really fast, and when you pull out the sticky note, there'll be a whole bunch of dirt on it! If it's a really dirty cart. Works good all the same. Am I making any sense?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sun Dec 04, 2005 10:17 pm</p><hr />

Actually I recall owning an official Nintendo cleaning kit and they tell you to dampen the cleaning surface in water!  You were insert the damp cleaning cartridge into the console 10-15 times and wait from 45 minutes to an hour for it to dry.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Sun Dec 04, 2005 9:11 pm</p><hr />

Nintendo's precautions notices for Game Boy games say to don't blow on cartridge. I don't have any notices for NES games, but I think it say the same. They also say to don't clean it with alcool, that, I think, would have no negative effect, even if there would be no positive either. They could tell to users that de-ox would work instead, notices say to use Nintedo made cleaning kits, but I never saw any !! I doubt they did that just for money, heh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Dec 04, 2005 1:51 am</p><hr />

Replace the 72-pin connector in the NES and virtually all of your NES games will work like a charm again.  You can feel it the first time you put in a cart after replacing the connector - you have to push with much greater force to get it in.<br /><br />If you don't want to replace the connector, it is possible to rework the pins on the existing connector to get them back to their original positions (over time the pins get pushed back due to the spring-loaded nature of the connector, preventing them from getting a strong contect).  I haven't done this personally so I don't know how easy it is or anything, but I know someone else who did this and it worked very well.<br /><br />If you don't want to do either of those, just try to insert the game to the correct position, making sure not to push the game too far into the console (it's way too easy in a worn-out NES to get the game in too far).  My brother said it's best to push in the cartridge just far enough that you can push it down, and no farther.  If you have a Game Genie around, consider using it - for some reason it's easier to get a game to start if it goes through a Game Genie (at least for me).<br /><br />Dirt can always play a role, so you should always be sure to clean the cartridges and the internal connector as well.  However, dirt is by no means the only reason for problems.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sun Nov 20, 2005 6:02 pm</p><hr />

I didn't think the contacts of the NES were made of brass, copper, pewter, chrome, or stainless steel.  Those are the metals Brasso is advertised to work on.  <br /><br />I can testify to the power of De-Ox spray.  I has some cartridges with very nasty contacts and after an application or two of De-Oxit! spray, they are reliable.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Sun Nov 20, 2005 2:58 pm</p><hr />
