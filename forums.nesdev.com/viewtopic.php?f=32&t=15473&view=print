		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi! I've been lurking for a little and noticed this contest going on. So, I've been working on this since around December. <br /><br />&quot;The paths of Bridewell&quot; is a topdown dungeon/escape type game. This is my first &quot;full&quot; game and I'm sure in parts you can tell it. It's a little bit of a challenge getting correct palettes across all major emulators and also real hardware. So take the colors for what they are. I hope they turned out right. The CRT I used for testing is, a little on the small side. It was tested on real hardware using INL's NROM board. There are a few problems, but nothing that is game breaking. It's been fun, and I'm not too good at talking so here's a couple of screens and a download. I'm going to go celebrate this game being done.<br /><br /> Thanks guys,<br /><br /> zkip

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks!<br /><br /> I'm also posting here to say that I got curious (lol) and searched on google to see if anyone was talking about this game and sure enough someone already has a video up of several of the entries. This video brought to my attention that maybe some of you are experiencing music issues. The music isn't supposed to be slow. I'm assuming it's because the author of this video was using some sort of PAL emulation/hardware, but I'll let it be known now that it's programmed for NTSC only. No PAL compatibility has been programmed.

He just passed through the rock, no matter where I put it

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for those comments guys. That's originally why I entered the contest, I'd like to see how to improve. I'll try to do something making sure the player knows how to use the ice.<br /><br /> About the speed, I sorta figured this. 2px per frame seemed like too much. Maybe I'll do some subpixeling. Also no, the only things the rocks stop are the player.

The idea is, IIRC, trip it by going in front of it, go to the left so you don't get hurt then hug the wall on the way down. If your sneaky enough and in the right side you can pass directly to the right of those fall down enemys and they won't trip.
