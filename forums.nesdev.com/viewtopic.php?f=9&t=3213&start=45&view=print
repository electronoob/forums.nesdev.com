<br />That's not really going to work, since the program lines on EPROMs/Flash Roms are held at ground in read mode, and need Vcc to program.  Only way to reprogram would be to pull.

CopyNES is NOT required to update mappers or add new mappers.  Those files are stored on the CF card.<br /><br />The boot rom is not nearly all the code.  The only thing it does is reset the cf card, check for file system etc, then load up a code module from the card.  Modules can use the boot rom to do things like file io and graphics but they could also have their own instead.  It is much like the CopyNES where small modules are loaded into ram.  All of the mapper fpga files are on the CF card.  The only boot rom bugs that I can think of would be if the cf card has a broken file system, or the scrolling in pal systems (may get garbage on top and bottom lines).<br /><br />For those that dont have a CopyNES I will likely have a free upgrade service for critical stuff.  Hopefully it will never be needed!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">INES header ambiguity </div>
<br />I will be adding iNES 2.0 so right now the wram saving for games that need more than 8KB is buggy.  That is a good example of the code modules, the game loading code for each mapper is just a file on the CF card so it can be updated anytime.
<br />
<br />See <a href="http://www.nespowerpak.com/mappers.png" class="postlink">www.nespowerpak.com/mappers.png</a> for the current mapper support level.  Not all bugs are marked yet (like big wram saving) but gives a general idea where its at now.

<br />What is "bad mapper"? I noticed that the mappers with the Officer Ugg symbol in <a href="http://tripoint.org/kevtris/Projects/console/mappers/index.html" class="postlink">Kevin Horton's FPGA NES mapper grid</a> are marked as "bad" in your grid, but there are others. Are pirate multis generally marked as "bad mapper", or only when all known dumps are bigger than 512 KiB PRG?
<br />
<br />9 (P*ROM) buggy, 10 (F*ROM) good. Aren't they the same thing except for the difference between 8 KiB and 16 KiB banking?
<br />
<br />99 (Vs. Unisystem, similar to CNROM): How are you handling the DIP switches? And does the loader support ROM patches to change the palette data, or must ROMs be pre-patched on the PC first?

<br />Right now it copies the rom file exactly, so it would have to be patched before going on the CF card.  The loading module could patch after loading but it would have to be able to identify the rom first.  CRC would slow down the loading, dont know if it would be too slow?
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks for pointing things like the DIP switches out, its exactly what I need to put on the website.

Maybe a handful of early adopters can split the total NES game list into evenly divided chunks and play test each game?  Maybe a phased release would be a good idea.  First sell to a small number of early adopters that have a CopyNES, let them help test it on all official Nintendo-made systems, test every game, and test it on PAL systems, etc.
<br />
<br />After the initial release, a second release can be done for more casual gamers.

<br />
<br />I got the news from atariage.com forum and I would love to have this one as well.  Add  me to the buyer list, I'd need to scrape up some money first.
<br />
<br />I didn't see this mentioned: 
<br />
<br />#1 Would the cart work in NES deck whose lockout chip was disabled by sniping pin 4?  This mod only affected one cart the NWC cart but that is a rare one and most will never own it. If your CIC clone behaves like standard Nintendo CIC, it can probably ignore disabled lockout chip and work fine.
<br />
<br />#2: Would thicker Type II/III CF and Microdrive work as well?  Actually I shouldn't be worried abou tthat as the 16MB CF card I have will hold more than a dozen NES games.

<br />
<br />My NWC cart works fine in my pin-4-snipped NES.  Never had a problem.
<br />
<br />I know the  NWC cart uses the Reset line for something critical that other carts don't use...were you confusing it with that?
<br />
<br />Oh, and will this cart play the NWC rom (dip switches an issue there too)?  I know MANY people have been dying to try this cart on real hardware.  This may be the first real opportunity people have to do so.  Without dip switch settings, I think the game hovers around 5:00 something instead of the standard 6:21 competition time.

The user would have to select DIP settings prior to game startup.  The ROMs will have to be patched anyway to overcome the various security mechanisms Nintendo had in place, as well as to offer a way to insert coins through a controller button press (it's hard to play a game without money, unless its DIP settings are set to Free Play of course).
