I really don't get it.<br /><br />If the problem is with all the sites being forcably redirected from HTTP to HTTPS, then yes, I maintain that was a very bad choice (yes I was aware of it after the server upgrade, but obviously did not test everything -- I figured it was done for the forum and only the forum); I get the impression that was being done in nginx.  There are an extremely large number of caveats/problems created by HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection, many of which aren't noticed until after-the-fact (these threads are proof).<br /><br />&quot;Migrating&quot; from HTTP to HTTPS is something that can happen on a per-site basis, but as I've stated in the past, I disagree heavily with the &quot;HTTPS everywhere&quot; mentality.<br /><br />The sites should've remained as they were originally -- HTTP -- and HTTPS added later so that it could be tested (and quirks/kinks/changes be worked out in advance for a full migration if needed/wanted).<br /><br />What exactly are we trying to solve with moving all the sites to HTTPS?  Are people *that* concerned about their forum and wiki credentials being compromised by mysterious intermediary forces?  Because I'm completely sure that shady ISPs and compromised backbone providers are collecting all the L/Ps as to destroy everything related to nesdev.  *blinks repeatedly*

SSL truly isn't needed most of the time.  What most end users are concerned with that justify SSL are 1) banking transactions, 2) PII (personally identifiable information), 3) L/Ps for sites they consider extremely important, and 4) &quot;general information&quot; that needs to be obscured in some way given plaintext transport (i.e. even using something like XOR &quot;encryption&quot; would be sufficient).  #3 is tricky because the importance level varies per person.

For example, a site might force HTTPS for its Administrator Control Panel.<br /><br />With the growing prevalence of ad blocking, I expect more sites to offer subscriptions. A site that debits the user's account for each article that the user views turns each page view into the equivalent of a &quot;banking transaction[]&quot;. And a site that offers a monthly or annual subscription is likely to have terms of service that ban sharing credentials or a session with a nonsubscriber. Such a site would use HTTPS to prevent inadvertent sharing with others on the same Wi-Fi.<br /><br />And sometimes the confidentiality aspect of TLS isn't as important as the integrity aspect. Sometimes you want to ensure that nobody has <em>modified</em> a piece of information on its way to you, such as to insert advertisements containing malicious scripts into a web page or to replace the executable that you are attempting to obtain with a trojan. For something like software downloads, would you prefer code signing to tamper-evident transport?<br /><br />This is also why there are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/#threat-risks" class="postlink">proposals to limit the Fullscreen API to a secure context</a>, so that a site can't phish your banking credentials or PII by <a href="http://feross.org/html5-fullscreen-api-attack/" class="postlink">simulating the operating system and browser chrome</a> and making you think you're on a site that you're not on.

So... IMO a &quot;shady ISP&quot; is a real and present danger, and the obscurity of NESDev is no protection against threat.<br /><br />The biggest problem isn't really that someone stealing an NESDev login can use it to access NESDev.com, the problem is that it's a certainty that tons of NESDev users are using shared passwords. The point of Google's SEO demotion is to protect users from themselves, more than anything else. (I <em>don't</em> think we should be concerned with SEO for NESDev, but I do think protecting its users is worth considering.)<br /><br /><br />Actually the executables thing is why I feel a bit anxious about all the binaries hosted on my own website. I try to put them on github, etc. where I can, but a lot of my hobby stuff isn't applicable to that, and I don't want someone to get malware because they tried to download my game demo at a coffee shop. I wish my site had HTTPS for that reason.

I imagine this is a pain to do consistently if you're not just always redirecting to HTTPS.<br /><br /><br />Don't feel like I'm pushing for HTTPS here. I'd prefer to be using it, personally, but please just do whatever you think is best for the site. I was OK with it being HTTP in the past, and I'd be OK with that in the future too. (It's obviously an administration hassle.)
