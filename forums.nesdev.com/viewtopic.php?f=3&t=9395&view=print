The screen loads the curtain and when it does its IRQ to start drawing the floor it freaks out. It seems to draw the screen over with black. it does this over and over and never gets out of this loop. I need help what could be the problem?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The CPU seems to be okay, it passes the instruction tests.<br />In Super Mario 3, the writes should look like this:<br /><br />scanline 248 (vblank time):<br />C000 = C1  ;next value for latch<br />C001 = xx  ;value C1 will be reloaded into the scanline counter at dot 260 of the prerender scanline<br />E001 = xx  ;allow MMC3 interrupts<br /><br />Interrupt should trigger at scanline 192, dot 260.  CPU will be at the address of the IRQ handler at about dot 284-295.<br /><br />scanline 193, 194:<br />E001 = xx  ;allow MMC3 interrupts<br />E000 = xx  ;acknowledge and disable MMC3 interrupts<br /><br />All I can say is also make sure that you keep the CPU's interrupt disable bit completely separate from the MMC3 interrupts.  Also make sure other possible sources of interrupts (like APU Frame IRQs or DMC) are separate too.  Also make sure that instructions like CLI or PLP check for interrupts too.<br /><br />You may also want to fix scrolling.  Slalom is a very easy test case to see if you are updating the X scroll correctly or not.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />CPU has its interrupt disable flag, and the interrupting device has its own interrupt flag.  Changing the CPU's interrupt disable flag shouldn't affect the interrupting device, nor the other way around.  Some people have made that mistake.<br /><br />By the way, when an Interrupt or NMI happens, the CPU's interrupt disable flag is turned on automatically.<br /><br />As for mentioning that CLI and PLP change the interrupt flag, and to check for interrupts at that time,  checking for interrupts at the start of every instruction works too.  I'm just used to writing really fast emulators that don't check those things constantly.<br /><br />But I think it's really strange that Megaman 3 works fine, but Super Mario 3 fails.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I check for interrupts after CLI, PLP, RTI, and after any event that would cause an interrupt to happen.  Interrupts could still possibly happen at any time, I just wrote my code differently.  Forget I ever said anything, that advice only applies to catch-up systems that keep executing instructions until the &quot;cycles remaining&quot; counter reaches 0, then it handles an event.<br /><br />But in general, when you're having problems matching other emulators, compare logs.  If you don't have logging in your emulator, add it in.<br />If you don't want to use logging, just watch specific events in the other emulator's debugger and see how your emulator does it differently.<br />For logging, try FCEUX.  For watching things in a debugger, try Nintendultor or FCEUX.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This Super Mario Bros 3 problem sounds vaguely familiar to me. Unfortunately if I had this problem with my emulator, I can't remember what caused it. I'd recommend checking out your IRQ behavior. Make sure acknowledging IRQs works correctly and the conditions for an IRQ are correct. You may have a problem that looks like a PRG mapping issue but it's actually caused by IRQs firing when they shouldn't.

(The PPU code is not the most accurate but it is generally functional.)

For example, I would write a class to output all given string to a file on the HD and output all of the execution step by step into that. Maybe run it until i see it flash and restart drawing again, that way its not that big of a file and i still capture the bug? Im sure if you guys search for fire and follow it from there you can immediately see what i cant see.<br /><br />Edit : can someone explain to me how Blargg tests for mmc3 detect the counter clocking even when the IRQ has been disabled? My mmc 3 does not pass test 1 error 3.
