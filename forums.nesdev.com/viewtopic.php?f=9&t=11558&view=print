This television can be switched between PAL and NTSC. In our country, we use PAL to watch TV(Power supply voltage is 220 ​​volts). Can I use this television to run a real NTSC NES console? If not, could you recommend to me another to run a real NTSC NES console(brand and detailed type)? If OKay, then please see next question, else see question 3.<br />2. Where can I buy a real NTSC NES console(not famiclones)?<br />3. I want a device which can be loaded a program. And the device can be runned on the real NTSC/PAL NES. In order to build that device, what do I need? Now, I have a computer only.<br />4. Where can I buy a MMC3 cartridge, for example, double dragon 2? I want to see why my MMC3 emulation is wrong.

There are literally hundreds of different NES consoles there, some of them are likely to fit your budget.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3.

These aren't exactly cheap, but this is the easiest way to run your programs on hardware. If you can solder, you can install sockets in a real NES cart so you can use EPROM/Flash chips. For this you'll obviously need an EPROM programmer, which can be cheaper than a Flash cart. If you're good with electronics you can try building your own EPROM programmer.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">4. Where can I buy a MMC3 cartridge, for example, double dragon 2? I want to see why my MMC3 emulation is wrong.</div><br />Again, ebay. NES carts are pretty cheap if the games are not good or famous. Many sellers will include one or more carts with consoles, so maybe you should look for an offer that includes an MMC3 cart.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm no expert, but even if 220 V is often used in PAL countries and 110 V in NTSC countries, I don't think this is a golden rule. Some countries like Brazil even use a 60Hz variation of PAL apparently. Since you mentioned that, I just wanted to make sure you don't mix those. If you switch your TV for NTSC, you should make sure it doesn't expect the supply to be 110V. If it expect 110V and recieve twice as much, I don't know what will happen but this certainly won't be good !<br /><br />While today for low power it's possible to make entirely electronics based supplies that auto-adapt between various AC voltages, this wasn't the case 50 years ago, so if such a switch exists, it probably just change something mechanically in a transformer to change the voltage ratio. So if the same switch change both the colour decoding and the power supply it should be manageable to mod it so it only change the colour decoding and not the supply.<br /><br />Another potential issue when importing a NTSC console in PAL land is how it will be connected to the TV. If you are going to use AV, there won't be any problem. If you are using RF however you'll have issues. When I tried connecting an imported USA NES to a modern PAL TV that also accepts NTSC by RF, the image worked, but I had very loud white noise in sound. I could hear the real sound very quietly below the noise, but it was basically unusable. I made a thread about this fact back then, pehaps you can find it with the search function ? (yes I'm that lazy)<br /><br />So basically you should either import the regular USA frontloader, or the japanese AV revision of the famicom if you want an authentic NTSC console and AV output. USA Toploaders or the original japanese famicom only have RF output, but you can mod them to get AV (that's what I did with my USA top loader).

The codec used here is H264 instead of MPEG2. That effectively prevents anyone from smuggling Japanese HDTV sets to use here. Also we do have 1SEG broadcasts but the bastards changed the spec of the audio codec. You can't use Japanese cell phones (or the PSP 1SEG tuner) here to watch 1SEG broadcasts unless you're ready to watch them muted.  -_-;

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Then you should subscribe to electoral list and make a program to convince people to vote for you. (assuming Brazil is not a single party dictatorship, which it doesn't seem to be according to a simple google search)<br /><br />And to be honest I'd be very surprised if politicians makes such decisions to bother people on purpose or whatever. Usually politics are totally retard when it comes to technology, or at least here. Not that this is bothering in any way, at least they're not close to enforce illegality of any kind of downloads, when they barely know what a computer is.

Also they want iron grip control over the populace spending habits. They're currently having a hard time preventing people here from buying stuff from Ebay and other international auction sites. If you google about problems sellers in USA have with Brazilian customers, it's mostly due to the customs trolling package liberations and such. The current government tactic is make importing so cumbersome you give up on doing it after a try or two.

People importing so many un-necessary stuff from contries far away of their living place is a major source of pollution and ecological disaster. It can also hurt the local economy if they are in concurrence.<br /><br />It becomes hard to buy something that didn't already did the world tour several times and this is getting so ridiculous.<br /><br />Of course in the case you actually need something that you cannot get anywhere else, then this is a problem.<br /><br />In regard of what you say, I think adoption of the PAL-M standard was probably done in the 60s or maybe early 70s, at least 30 years before ebay came.

The idea was stop people from importing USA TVs (which was common at the time) and when VHS VCRs appeared in the early 80s people also imported a LOT of these. I had a National NV-G9 VCR which had to be modified to work with PAL-M. There were specialized shops on that kind of service.<br /><br />I never understood why the government did not use that on their favour instead. If this country was NTSC it could have become a production zone for USA manufacturers. These went to Asia instead and a great opportunity was lost.  <br /><br />Don't try to understand the idiots running the government here. This country is this screwed because they keep following the farmers and mining companies wills and whims.
