Stability fixes to address crashes on app exit or project closure.  Most turned out to be related to shutting down threads handling debuggers.<br />2. Fix for choppy 'farting' audio caused by inclusion of FT in NESICIDE and inappropriate SDL buffer sizing.<br /><strong>3. Inclusion of qbradq's uc65 tool and a NROM template project for it, accessible via Project-&gt;New Project.  Create, build, run, and debug step/breakpoint through your UC65 project.</strong><br />4. Fixed focus problem on Ctrl+Shift+F - now focuses in search text entry field so you can start typing text to search for immediately as you'd expect to be able to.<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn't get to the enhancement requests yet [palette picker, open with...]<br /><br />As usual, bug reports, enhancement requests, always welcome.

At the moment I am porting FamiTracker to Qt -- and if you create a Music object you'll see that FamiTracker is embedded in NESICIDE.  You should be able to drag/drop an existing FTM onto NESICIDE and it'll add it to your project.  I had thought a &quot;sound designer&quot; might look something like the SoundMaker in Garry Kitchens' GameMaker for the Commodore 64.  But having seen what FamiTracker is capable of and seen what people like Shiru have done with it in using it to create sound effects, I'm thinking that FamiTracker could serve both music and sound effect purpose.<br /><br />At present the FamiTracker re-implementation is not 100% complete but it is at least slightly useable for creating and playing back things.

How long, exactly, does it take?  How long, exactly, do you think it should take?  The reality is I probably won't be able to meet your expectation but your report that it is taking too long is probably not ungrounded, so I am trying to understand where we're at.<br /><br />As for going back to MFC.  No.  I am trying to be helpful to others beyond &quot;just run my shit in Wine, yo&quot;.  I do have a special place in my heart for MFC.  But I think of it fondly as a memory, not as a desire to ever go back.
