If anything, It's closer to 8.</div><br />Probably because of early Macs (if I recall correctly), those also had a 68000 running at 7.67MHz, but because of the video hardware hogging the memory bus in practice it was more like 6MHz.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">(About the 68000 vs. the 65816, is the Genesis's CPU truly about twice as fast then, or is it less efficient?

Still the 68000 instruction set allows it to do more stuff in less instructions (less need to move things around that you'll use only once, and usually you won't need to touch RAM for variables in subroutines), as well as having 32-bit instructions (which are slightly slower, but still much faster than doing it with two 16-bit operations), so it still has an edge there. How much it helps depends on how complex your calculations need to be.<br /><br />This is comparable to Z80 vs 6502, really.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Were you the one that made the demo?

When just storing graphics (as nearly every game does) it's a non-problem, the problem is when software rendering kicks in.<br /><br />Note, it still may be helpful. I know that one trick on the Amiga is to reserve one or two bitplanes for lighting and use the rest for coloring the polygons =P Then just use an appropriate palette. (it does reduce how many colors you can use, but still...)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">psycopathicteen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Does anybody know how much faster the 68000 is than the 65816 at running C with the most efficient compilers around?  Shiru's DK Classic game runs at a solid 60fps.</div><br />No idea, but I would guess 68000 may be faster because it has more registers (no idea how much of an issue is using zero page on the 65816 though). Also I imagine that 65816 would be using 16-bit ints, while 68000 uses 32-bit ints.<br /><br />That said, could be anything really, since the C ABI on the 68000 is pretty wasteful... (only two integers and two pointers can be passed through registers, and everything is stored as 32-bit unless it's an array, even chars *shudders*)

I'm friends with him (though I think the last time I talked to him was in 1995 or thereabouts, so this would be an Email out of no where), so I suppose I could ask him to write me something a page or two long that I could post here.<br /><br />I offer this because I find there to be too many threads these days that consist of all this weird speculation, almost like nobody knows who to ask simply because they're too young or I-don't-know-what.  Googling &quot;65816 C compiler&quot; turns up a ridiculous amount of discussion.<br /><br />My own experience with both CPUs and C (and it's important to know my 68K is extremely limited) tells me that the 65816 would perform substantially worse than the 68K at C, mainly because of the large number (and size) of registers on the 68K, and the semi-limited number of addressing modes (especially relating to stack operations).<br /><br />That said: the Apple IIGS did have a C compiler, <a href="http://store.16sector.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=190" class="postlink">ORCA/C</a>, which was also used to build <a href="http://www.gno.org/gno/" class="postlink">GNO/ME</a> (UNIX for the Apple IIGS) (do not confuse GNO/ME with the GNOME GUI framework for present-day *IX systems).<br /><br />But my general view is that I think you're wasting your time if you're hoping to do some SNES game in C.  You're still going to end up having to write a substantial amount of assembly, so really what's the benefit.  It reminds me (distantly) of Shiru working on a C-based NES game using cc65, and he was able to do it (and it was pretty cool!), but if I remember right it was painful given all the limitations.  My view is that you'd probably be better off writing some intermediary language that generates 65816 assembly code to help with simplifying main programming logic and so on.  I'd bet you money that at least a few commercial game companies did something like this, to help streamline some forms of development.  Please note I <strong>AM NOT</strong> talking about an interpreted language, but rather something that &quot;simple&quot; like BASIC except it'd be shoved through a parser and the result would be assembly code that could be assembled.

This advanced hacking was running UAE along with a linux command-line ADF tool, so....<br /><br />Perhaps it's more a slight, but latent, fear of Nintendo and mentioning the word &quot;homebrew&quot;?  Maybe it's a safer story on the MD/Genesis.  Or maybe the homebrew enthusiasts have their attention turned to different systems on different continents?  They're all possible.

Rephrased: I'm the one who thinks it was painful.<br /><br />At this time it doesn't look like cc65 has support for the 65816 (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">cc65.exe -h</tt> reports <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">--cpu type / Set cpu type &#40;6502, 65c02&#41;</tt>); someone willing to extend it to work with 65816 and its addressing modes/etc. will certainly have their work cut out for them (have fun learning all the innards!).  ;-)<br /><br />The stack-based addressing modes might come in handy, ditto with instructions like PEA/PEI, but that all depends on how much of the stack actually gets used.  I'd be willing to bet, at least for the SNES, having 8KBytes of RAM ($0000-1FFF) to work with would help, and 16-bit registers.  But still 3 registers, so...<br /><br />The ORCA/C documentation for the Apple IIGS, if I remember right, tends to go into some detail about its design decisions somewhere in the manual, so maybe reading that would come in handy.  Sadly I do not have a copy of ORCA/C handy, but I'd be happy to buy it (US$35 isn't that bad, and I tend to collect Apple IIGS software anyway).

Simple answer : <strong>no way</strong> !<br />Of course psycopathicteen wrote a nice demo (for a SNES), but that is a simple demo with very &quot;constrained&quot; code, simple collisions, explosion schem or whatever. The real game on MD is far much heavier in term of computing and not being able to recognize that this game is definitely out of scope for the SNES is pure fanboy biased view.<br />Even Sonic on many aspects would hurt on SNES, many MD games are not reproducible on SNES just because of the large difference between processing speed.<br />The 65816 is weak, accepts it... It's nice to see people trying to get max out of it, but in any case you will always have less, and actually *far less* (i estimate about half) that what you can get from the MD 68000.<br />The MD has its flaws (as the limited number of color) but definitely the weak CPU on the SNES is the biggest one from this machine among others.<br /><br />Here's a topic i started comparing 65x architecture versus others CPU and why IMO this CPU sucks so bad :<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?29372-Let-s-compare-65x-CPU-architecture-vs-68000-%28or-others%29/page2">http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread ... s%29/page2</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'm so tired of reading 65X is fast...

Also as a reminder you are here on a Nintendo forum so it's not the best place to advocate the Megadrive (not that we have anything against that machine of course).<br /><br />As for code generation for the 6502 family of processor, it seems nobody has yet tried real hard enough to write or target an optimized compiler for the 65xx family of processor. CC65 is based on SmallC which is fundamentally inefficient. LCC is easy to retarget, but do not do many target-independent optimizations. Same problem for SDCC, with the aditional problem it's harder to re-target.<br /><br />I start to have a very clear idea how a back-end for any generated code (not necessary from C) could handle a pseudo-stack without actually using a stack, but this would require a special assembler and linker to handle this functionality to overlay variables in carefully computed fixed locations.

The physics are actually extremely simple, and every enemy is basically box collision + those simple physics + some really dumb AI.

The graphics are full of ugly gradients and bad perspective, the physics isn't as dynamic and exploitable, the level layouts are boring and much more linear... it's inferior in every aspect IMO.<br /><br />Another SNES game that feels somewhat similar to Sonic is <em>Twinbee: Rainbow Bell Adventure</em>. I haven't played this one much, but at first glance it looks more polished than the Speedy Gonzales game.<br /><br />Seeing as I believe that even the NES can pull off a fast-paced engine similar to Sonic (as long as you code it well), of course I believe the SNES can do it too. An original game would be nicer than a direct port, though, not only because of the different resolution, but also because the system has a lot of interesting graphical features that could be used to implement new interesting gimmicks, bosses, and so on.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Even the collision detection on the original Sonic games isn't perfect.</div><br />Definitely not. There's a YouTube series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL01596721403E0594" class="postlink">Sonic 3 and Knuckles Glitches and Oversights</a>, that shows a lot of oddities, many of them related to collisions.<br /><br />Collisions aren't as complicated as people sometimes make them out to be. If you don't plan things well in the beginning, then yeah, you'll end up having to deal with a lot of exceptions and it'll become hell to manage, but if you can define a set of universal rules, reducing exceptions to the minimum, the logic comes out much nicer. I'm mostly talking about slopes here, since collisions with blocks are insanely simple.

Simple answer : <strong>no way</strong> !<br />Of course psycopathicteen wrote a nice demo (for a SNES), but that is a simple demo with very &quot;constrained&quot; code, simple collisions, explosion schem or whatever. The real game on MD is far much heavier in term of computing and not being able to recognize that this game is definitely out of scope for the SNES is pure fanboy biased view.<br />Even Sonic on many aspects would hurt on SNES, many MD games are not reproducible on SNES just because of the large difference between processing speed.<br />The 65816 is weak, accepts it... It's nice to see people trying to get max out of it, but in any case you will always have less, and actually *far less* (i estimate about half) that what you can get from the MD 68000.<br />The MD has its flaws (as the limited number of color) but definitely the weak CPU on the SNES is the biggest one from this machine among others.<br /><br />Here's a topic i started comparing 65x architecture versus others CPU and why IMO this CPU sucks so bad :<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread.php?29372-Let-s-compare-65x-CPU-architecture-vs-68000-%28or-others%29/page2">http://www.sega-16.com/forum/showthread ... s%29/page2</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'm so tired of reading 65X is fast... They should consider the whole, then you realize how much the 65x is... inefficient.</div><br />Can somebody, for the love of God, mark this as spam? Why do people act like Gunstar Heroes is the pinnacle of &quot;action-packed adventures!&quot;?

You can't seriously tell me the SNES &quot;couldn't handle it&quot; Hell, Contra III isn't that much less &quot;explosive&quot; or whatever. Also, If the Genesis is so powerful and can handle the &quot;almighty Gunstar Heroes&quot; then how about you try to port this over to it: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2KP4rjACXQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2KP4rjACXQ</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Even Sonic on many aspects would hurt on SNES, many MD games are not reproducible on SNES just because of the large difference between processing speed.</div><br />What are you smoking?
