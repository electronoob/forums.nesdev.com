I should have something up by the end of the week.  I wrote some software to generate mapper configs this weekend (but I haven't updated the nes-side firmware to use them yet), but I won't have much time for the next few days.<br /><br />BTW. apart from a lack of good documentation and a dislike of his absolute addressing syntax (mainly because I didn't realize what he used, and spent an hour trying to figure out why it wasn't working until I looked at the assembled code and saw the wrong opcode), I'm really starting to like NESHLA.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Aug 15, 2005 2:26 pm</p><hr />

Doh, of course the mmc5 writes are only 5 bits each, so keeping the irq latch in such a configuration is downright silly.  It'd be much easier to just control it all from native mode and cut the MMC1 shift-reg logic entirely.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Tue Aug 02, 2005 10:11 pm</p><hr />

Yay:<br />cart PCB's arrived today, and look awesome.<br />I soldered two up and can program the CPLD fine, but...<br /><br />Boo:<br />devkit PCB's aren't here yet<br />eprom programmer isn't here yet<br /><br />so... I can't program the flash on the damn things to test out the rest of the board or the mapper<br /><br />Additional Boo:<br />Benchmarq parts are way, way too tall to fit in the case (sram with internal battery and watchdog ic).  Dallas / ST parts are just as tall, but Simtek parts will work, if I can find a place that will sell them in onesies (and when I do find them, I have 2x 32 KB and 1x 128 KB Benchmarq parts for sale at cost).<br /><br />usb link cable isn't talking to the host pc yet (should have gone with a ftdi+pic combo (it just works), the usb pics are nasty)<br /><br />Note:<br />This isn't designed as a console copier.  It can act as one for what, half of released games or so, but it's designed primarily as a development tool.  I orignally planned on designing the same PCB, and seperate fusemaps for each of the discrete mappers, so people could get a UOROM dev cart, or a Color Dreams dev cart, etc..., but after designing that and writing the vhdl, with a superset of pins needed for any one design, I realized that the other mappers would all fit together, so I didn't have to have 10 seperate mapper loads, just the one.<br /><br />It's also a 'first step', since I really want to design a MMC5-esque devcart with exwram graphics and math copro (mult, div, table-basd trig) etc..., but I didn't feel comfortable going whole hog and designing a fpga-based board with the regulators to provide the core voltages, level converters on 60 pins of i/o, etc...  Instead, I started with the simplest, cheapest 5V CPLD I knew of and grew from there, seeing what would fit.  I ended up doubling to a 64, which let get get MMC1 in and a nicer control mechanism for native mode, but going any larger would be really expensive.<br /><br />No IRQ counter because I didn't have a spare pin or macrocells.  One could be added at the expense of say, CHR banking by grounding CHR A16, grabbing the CHR A16 line off the mapper and soldering a jumper to the IRQ pin on the edge connector, and removing all the CHR banking code (close to half the macrocells actually, and replacing them with a latchable counter).  Aren't CPLDs wonderful <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />If you kept the MMC1 style PRG and config mode code, you could then create a shall we call it MMC1.5, with a M2 IRQ counter (PPU_A12 is a bit trickier, but doable, as you need to cut the A12 into mapper trace and stick a filtering cap on the input), 16/16 banked/switched PRG, and VRAM.  Stick the latch on CHR reg 0, and the enable/acknowledge/reload logic on CHR reg 1.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Tue Aug 02, 2005 10:08 pm</p><hr />

Sounds interesting.  So "DumbNES" is a CopyNES &amp; Flash Cart?  In other words, it is probably the first NES copier!  Why don't you make an account for these forums and log in?  That way we can all know which hardware project this is exactly.  There are multiple projects at different stages of completion.  MidiNES, CopyNES, FPGA NES, Squeedo, and others.  However, no other project seems to have goals of a full featured copier, as your DumbNES does.<br /><br />The bare minimum to be considered a console copier, in my opinion, is to be able to backup most of the console's game and to be able to play these backups, without the original cart, on the actual system.  CopyNES with a RAM cart can't do this, as it can backup any game, but it can't play any backup.  FPGA NES can't backup games and it can't play them on a real NES.  Squeedo is more akin to Color Dream's Super Cart, i.e. a cart with a powerful mapper.  MidiNES is a NES cart for doing professional audio stuff.<br /><br />So most of these projects are distinct in their feature set, except for CopyNES which appears to be subsumed, feature-wise, by DumbNES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Tue Jul 26, 2005 12:44 pm</p><hr />

Well, I've ordered the PCB's for both the devkit and the cartridge, and most of the parts are on their way (except for the WRAM and a 5 pin inverter that adding the WRAM required...), so I'll know in a week or two whether it'll work or if I have a bunch of expensive, bogus PCB's <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I just want to say that Memblers is right, Myro PCB are inexpensive and easy to work with, hopefully the quality will also match.<br /><br />Theoretical capabilities:<br />512 KB PRG FLASH<br />8 or 32 KB WRAM (not battery backed, but pinned out for TI NVSRAM as well as straight SRAM, although the TI parts may be too tall to fit in an unmodified case)<br />128 KB CHR RAM<br />Spot for CIC with jumper for both normal and B1 revisions (probably pointless, but hey, I'm a perfectionist).<br />Correct NES board sizing: 0.047 inch thick, 2.5 mm pin spacing.<br /><br />Note: I still need someone to look in a few PAL carts to make sure the CICs are wired up the same (see the CIC pinout thread), as I won't have access to my PAL carts for another month or so.<br /><br />Native mode:<br />16 / 32 KB PRG switching (16 KB mode has one page locked)<br />4 / 8 KB CHR switching of full 128 KB VRAM (tepples should like this ^_^)<br />Mirroring control (one screen or H/V, but no four-screen)<br />Flash ROM write control, so cartridge can (and will, since I'm not building an external programmer) be self-writable via NES code<br /><br />(The write control is actually the entire reason the mapper started getting complicated, as I was originally going to do a UNROM flash cartridge, but I needed extra logic to disable the mapper and allow flash writes, and switchable mirroring would be nice, and why stick a PAL on there when a CPLD isn't much more, and makes life easier, and so forth...)<br /><br />In addition to a native mode, it also supports most every type of discrete logic mapper, and all MMC1 board types except SUROM (the last 64 KB will be locked with backup firmware to load over the comms cable, so you can't fit a full 512 KB on there) and SOROM (I haven't written the code for this yet, but it should fit.  I don't have any SOROM games so it's a lower priority)<br /><br />Discretes that I'm sure will work:<br />AMROM<br />ANROM<br />AOROM<br />BNROM<br />CNROM<br />GNROM<br />MHROM<br />NROM<br />RROM<br />UNROM<br />UOROM<br />Color Dreams / Wisdom Tree (everything but AGCI 50282)<br /><br />Doable right now, but may be cut if I need the space for something else:<br />NINA-03 / 06<br />Tengen 80008<br /><br />Should be doable, i.e. unimplemented<br />Camerica BF9093 / BF9097 (don't have the games, but the mapper seems sane)<br />CPROM / Videomation (have it, but honestly, it's not worth the effort for a mediocre paint program)<br /><br />Might be doable.  I don't have any of these games, but the mapper docs indicate they'll fit into my design.<br />Mapper 70: Bandai 74161/32<br />Mapper 78: Irem 74161/32<br />Mapper 87: Jaleco 74138/74<br />Mapper 93: Mapper 93<br />Mapper 140: Bio Senshi Dan<br />Mapper 145: Sachen SA-72007<br />Mapper 149: Sachen SA-0036<br /><br />Kinda doable:<br />NSFs that either don't bankswitch, or bankswitch once (i.e. expect the loader to use the bankswitch values, but never write to the $5FFx registers).<br /><br />Devkit Capabilities:<br />128 KB Flash<br />8 or 32 KB RAM<br />A few extra I/O pins (going to wire up a RGB LED for the power light I think, to indicate comms status or for debugging, or whatever)<br /><br />Works in a similar fashion to CopyNES, with the device between the CPU and the NES board, although it uses different parts and has (will have) different firmware, and it may or may not fit <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I measured pretty closely, but it's a tight fit between it and the end of the case (no cable is used, it plugs directly into the NES board)<br /><br />32 KB version can act as a RAM cartridge if you stick in a VRAM game with the appropriate mirroring (8 KB can run code too, but 8 KB isn't a ton of space to work with).<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Mon Jul 25, 2005 9:02 pm</p><hr />
