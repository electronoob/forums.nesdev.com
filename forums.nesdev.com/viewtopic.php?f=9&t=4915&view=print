		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm trying to work out some differences between various Namcot 163 class chips like the 175 and 340, but because CopyNES uses $4800-4FFF for I/O, I can't access the 163's data I/O register in the same space.
<br />
<br />This has been brought up in the past, and supposedly you can re-map the port address to $4000-47FF by writing to $4016 (using bit 1), but that hasn't worked for me. Any ideas? (bunnyboy? kevtris?)
<br />
<br />As an alternative, could you achieve this by changing the address in the source and recompiling / rewriting BIOS? Or is there something you'd also have to change in the hardware?
<br />
<br />Also does anyone know of any demo code for using Namco exp sound? Something as simple as generating a tone would be sufficient to check whether a cart has the capability or not.

<br />
<br />I can't really answer your question regarding changing the I/O registers. I don't know for a fact but it seems odd that you can switch the range to $4000 - $47FF, since there are sound registers in that area, along with a few others.
<br />
<br />If the game is N106, it would probably be easy to tell by dumping some of the data and examining the code. I am currious though, which game(s) are you working on dumping?
<br />
<br />There are plenty of N106 NSFs laying around if you wish to examine code.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not preventing me from dumping anything (besides RAM contained inside the chip). I mainly just wanted to figure out exactly what features each chip does and does not support.
<br />
<br />I should probably note that you need to add resistors on the data lines in the FC-&gt; NES adapter in order to dump carts that use this address space otherwise the copynes will usually crash. I can't remember the resistor values off the top of my head, but there is a thread here that details it.
