You can sense the difference, so they could have easily allowed sram to work.

If they did something like that it would give even more reason as to why flash carts don't work.<br /><br />Again all of this is only speculation, but they are things that could have happened that would break current flash carts.<br /><br />Who knows perhaps the both the PAR and flash carts use the nn6000h-nn7FFFh expansion, something like that would also cause issues.

A reproduction seller called Pachichi (you might remember him posting basic questions about repro and looking for programmer for random vapor-ware project) had mold made from the official cart and is now selling blank cases for 6$, maybe less if you buy in bulk. I'm definitively not affiliated with him but always welcome the use of new parts over destroying carts. <a href="http://store.retroquestgames.com/" class="postlink">http://store.retroquestgames.com/</a><br /><br />I must say that your different projects are becoming more awesome every days!

I just ordered a pair of his cases to see how they are.  All I knew is someone supposedly had them and they were identical to the standard carts.  So that's part of the reason I went with the original PCB form factor.  They fit in the retrousb cases as well, but they are also not doing SNES repros anymore so I'd have to see if they still have cases around they'd like to part with.

Those are 8 megaBYTE ROM chips.  And it depends on your definition of &quot;without a hitch&quot; since some games have copier protections and won't work on this because of the larger RAM size (Super Metroid, for one), but uCON64 is able to patch most of those...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah we'll have to make sure someone with a PAR gets one in their hands to test em out when they're ready for full release.  I appreciate the volunteers!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mog123 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So every game up to 2MB in size, without using any special chips should work without a hitch?</div><br /><br />That's the goal, but actually all the way up to 128Mbit as qwertymodo pointed out.  Which is somewhat of a lie,  There's only ~90+ some Mbit addressable to the cart at one time due to the SNES memory map.  But I can put a unique bit in every last bit of addressable ROM.  To answer your question though, anything that works on a HiROM or LoROM board should be as 'hitchless' as possible. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />As for the issue of some games having 'flash cart' protection like metroid, I can pretty much make any of the memories look as small as desired using the CPLD.  So if something breaks with more than 64Mbit of SRAM I can 'trim' the SRAM down to 64Mbit to trick the rom.  I can do similar things with the flash (or put a smaller flash chip on the board) if desired as well.  Although choices like that may have to be made at time of purchase, not sure how configurable they'll be afterwards.  I did add a slide switch to the final PCB that should allow for switching back and forth between Hi and Lo ROM on a single cart.  There's enough space in the CPLD to support that.<br /><br />In other news I did fix my bug with the programmer and have successfully tested out both Hi and Lo ROM games thus far.  Still have some things to work on before I can test out 6MBYTE games, but they shouldn't be much trouble.  I'm ordering the first 'official' batch of boards this evening, along with a big batch of kazzos to go along with em <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Additionally I got a pair of the SNES cases, thanks for pointing them out to me SkinnyV.  The good news is they're pretty awesome and I'm pretty impressed by the 'snap' open/close action of the cases.  Honestly I wasn't expecting them to work well, but they're pretty great in practice.  I'm actually planning on having a batch of those when the boards are ready to release so it can be a package deal with case and all right out the gate!

I don't think there is any one game/hack that uses that much memory at the moment anyways though.  Either way all the address lines for a 8MByte chip was already there so it only took another /CE pin on the mapper to expand up to 16MByte.<br /><br />I'm not sure how many different flavors of memory sizes I'll sell it in, it'll kinda depend on what people request.
