As far as I know, there were no TV consoles, but Game&amp;Watch (Soviet clones, at least) actually have 4-bit MCU.<br /><br />Another interesting thing in this regard is that popular 8-bit Z80 CPU, used in many systems, has 4-bit ALU internally.

The 68000 is horribly slow when it has to access memory though... You're looking at an average of 12~20 cycles for an opcode with memory access (akin to 6~10 cycles on the 65816 in HiROM).<br /><br />The 65816 is better at accessing memory instead, especially with regards to zero page (which is practically register-like speed), although it's kind of dumbed down by the opcodes (many opcodes involve the A register, in contrast with the 68000 where if a register is in use you can use any of its kind, and many opcodes allow a lot of different combinations as well), so that may negate its speed somewhat by spending opcodes having to move stuff around. Also that made it harder to program =P<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Shiru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Another interesting thing in this regard is that popular 8-bit Z80 CPU, used in many systems, has 4-bit ALU internally.</div><br />So <em>that</em> is why the Z80 takes 4 cycles minimum... Actually um, I thought it was decode opcode &gt; run opcode &gt; update address low byte &gt; update address high byte?<br /><br />In any case the Z80 is insanely slow, it suffers from the same issue as the 68000 in terms of cycle usage, but it suffers the same issue as the 65816 for register usage, and it lacks the zero page advantage, so it's basically the worst of both worlds. That's really annoying, especially when you have to push a new sample exactly every 336 cycles (which is the case of my sound engine). There's some error margin before the human ear can notice it, but not much and it's still annoying. Glad the hardware timers loop on their own, even if I have to still poll them manually (as there are no interrupts)...<br /><br />I guess this is going off-topic anyway so I better stop here.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In the example above 6502 copies byte per iteration while Z80 copies two bytes per iteration, that's why the count is divided by two.<br /><br />Absolute clock frequency does not really matter. It is just a requirement of a particular design. There was a time when 1.79MHz and 3.5MHz were common for 6502 and Z80 respectively, and at the time there was neither 6502 at 3.5MHz nor Z80 at 1.79Mhz. If a common situation would be both CPUs commonly running at the same frequency, then yes, there would be a reason to state that one is faster than another, but it never was like that.<br /><br />Also, I think that it makes sense to judge which is faster and which is 'insanely slow' when you know both CPU very well. If your experience is mostly 6502 and you only read a bit about another CPU, of course you will think 6502 is faster - because you know efficient ways to do things on that CPU and don't know these for another.<br /><br />I would state that both of these two CPUs are more or less equal at their common clock frequencies, with minor advantages and disadvantages in specific areas. I can easily participate in further comprasions.
