<br />Oh for god's sake, is it really THAT irritating? Just ignore it. There are plenty of people who are legitimately active on this site who talk about legitimate stuff. True, I get a little disappointed when I see that there is a new post only to find that it's trashy spam, but I really don't let it get to me. It's not like you're getting personally harassed or anything... That's just what I think.

Jargon may be annoying (he reasons are mostly irrelevant), but has he broken an actual rule?  Probably, but I haven't checked the fine print.  Tepples has stated that he won't issue a "bill of attainder" [3] or take any action based on an 'expost facto law'.  I don't know about the rest of the world, but those principles are fundamental part of our (USA) rights in our Constitution (Article 1, sections 9 &amp; 10).  People died in a war to give us those rights (I'm talking to you, UK....  Hi over there...)  
<br />
<br />Anyway... Just let the owner of the board modify the rules (ie, more clearly define 'being a dick' or 'asshattery' (to borrow a term from Loopy)), and then appropriately ban asshats AFTER the new rule goes into effect and AFTER said asshat engages in asshattery.

<br />
<br />I ignored it the first time.  And the tenth time.  And the hundredth.  I could keep ignoring it forever.  I can pretty much depend on spam appearing like clockwork now.  Something would feel missing if we _didn't_ get our regular dose of spambots.
<br />
<br />I'm not annoyed by spammers.  I'm annoyed at moderators for letting an excellent board slowly get run down from prolonged negligence.

<br />I'm willing to do <strong>whatever it takes</strong> to accomodate the community here, though. The good news is that the other two forums I'm running off of this code have had no spambots whatsoever.

<br />Oh, one nice plus over phpBBs: Threads don't all instantly mark themselves read if you leave the board for more than 15 minutes.

<br />
<br />I also started it because I have a lot of experience in running forums (see <a href="http://jul.rustedlogic.net/index.php" class="postlink">Jul</a>). Letting this shit happen is a great way to lose people, and having threads full of spam tends to cause some problems down the road with people who aren't following along.
<br />
<br />In addition, if we set up an IRC channel, I could set up my bot to report all new replies to that channel; so, for example, when somebody makes a new thread about something, you can jump right on it and help them out as soon as possible instead of just sitting here refreshing every five minutes =P
<br />
<br />I wouldn't have considered this at all if it wasn't for the (many) people in this thread complaining about all the problems here... and with a concerted effort, we can move everything to the other one all in one fell swoop without leaving anything behind.

<br />
<br />Okay, there's a major difference here. A. There aren't people spamming all day and night here. True, practically every day, but not <em>all</em> the time. B. If there's a spam post, scroll past it... Press the "back" button... There's all sorts of things you can do to <em>not</em> have the spam displayed on your screen. It's a lot easier to not see than to not hear. Though I do agree that the not personally harassing thing would be a lame excuse if your neighbors were shouting sales pitches.
<br />
<br />But I'd rather have it so something <em>is</em> done about spam, but I'm not going to leave this board because of it. At least not at this low magnitude of spam.
<br />
<br />Though if everyone/everything moves to another thread to reduce spam, I'd be perfectly happy.

Who's to say it's not some newbie? This is especially true where the only new post is in a thread -- who says it's not some newbie with a question or detail or something? You don't know it's spam until you view it -- and if turns out the only new post in that thread is spam, congratulations, you've just wasted time. <em>That</em> annoys people.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It's a lot easier to not see than to not hear.

It's <em>deader than dead</em>. There's no mention of the Wiki. The forum has only a passing mention. The last update was <em>over three years ago</em>. For all intents and purposes, somebody coming here would see it and think the site's been <strong>long dead</strong>!
<br />
<br />On the other hand, while I know the site <a href="http://nindev.rustedlogic.net/board/" class="postlink">here</a> is all but blank, I would be <em>more</em> than willing to set up a news system so people active in the nesdev community could post about things happening in the scene, such as new emulators, demos, documents, whatever -- so that there's an actual <em>updated front page</em>.
<br />
<br />In other words, <em>spam isn't the only reason</em>. The whole <em>site</em> here is falling apart. I want to help fix this, but with none of the admins or anybody active, the only option I have is to make something new.
<br />
<br />That's what I'm doing. If we all co-operate with this, we can all achieve something better -- that's all I'm saying.
<br />
<br />Believe me, I didn't want to move either (it's more to deal with). It's just that this site is all but forgotten by the owners.

I agree it would be nice to see a front page that was constantly updated, maybe with people's demos uploaded so we wouldn't have to start new topics for all of our demos/games. I'm totally up for an improved front page, no matter how it comes about.
<br />
<br />And you're right about the wasting time part that's annoying. Though you can usually tell if something's spam. If you see one spam post from a member, you can be sure that all posts by them are spam. I usually don't waste my time to view them all. But still, you have to initially waste time to make sure the member is a spammer, which sucks.
<br />
<br />Oh, and the funny thing is, I was messing around with NESDev trying to figure out basic stuff for about 6 months. I was well aware of the front page, but I had no idea this forum existed until I randomly ran into it!
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oh, by the way, to reduce the number of spammers here, it'd be great to ban anyone with this as their website:
<br />
<br />www dot u4game dot com
<br />
<br />I've seen several spammers with this as their personal website.
