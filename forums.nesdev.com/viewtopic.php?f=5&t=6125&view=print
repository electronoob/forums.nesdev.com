<br />
<br />I usually don't say my comment that hard and it may (?) offend a few people that already tried it but for now... It feels like the old Capcom way: just bring another bland game ASAP. Welcome back Capcom!.... The intro is a good example of recycling some of the idea of MM9.
<br />
<br />By the way Capcom, we're waiting with anticipation for Super hyper Street figher 4 alpha in 6 months that is not complete and you need to buy all those extra DLC to make it the real game.. We know it's coming, isn't it..

<br />- The only music I know of MM10 is that from the official trailer, but please, don't tell me where it plays. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> MM10 is looking "exotic", can't wait to play it.

<br />- Fact: the Wii version looks like a reused/edited MM9 according with some <em>h4ck3r5</em>. There's a lot of stuff left. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />

I just listened to the soundtrack of the bosses only, saw the intro and beginning of stages and for now it doesn't feel as great as MM9.  I was expecting a lot about the music (like Willy stage 1 in MM9 and many others songs) and I felt let down completely.  It came out in the US before Japan so it's not available yet on some platform.
<br />
<br />As for buying a Wii, knowing how much they extort money in Brazil to buy the original one, unless you have many, many games you want to buy: don't get one. I bought one for my children but in general the games are, well, nothing special (my opinion, nobody has to agree with it).

<br />
<br />Interesting fact: In Japan, you can go to the convenience store to buy points for any of the current console. You can even actually buy some coupon from your cellphone too.

<br />
<br />Actually it's not points cards like at the game store or Walmart/Zellers etc.  You go to a special machine, browse the menu and find the options for points for the console you want. You decide how much you want and it will print an invoice. You go to the register and pay. The employee will then print a ticket with a code that will work right away.
<br />
<br />With that machine you can buy all kind of stuff like tickets for see baseball match, train/plane ticket etc. I don't think I saw anything like that in the States of Canada unless it changed recently (topic split I guess it this continue).

<br />
<br />A multikiosk doesn't work stateside because distribution groups cannot agree on a specific platform for purchases...not that it matters anyways as it seems all major vendors accept credit cards and allow purchase at TOD or an electronic purchase of points anyways...I haven't purchases a Wii or Microsoft Points card yet simply because they accept my card through the console.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure how Sony does it because I don't use it enough to know.

<br />I think the points cards are designed for 1. giving as gifts and 2. buying with cash, as a school-age child might do with lawn care money.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not specifically.  In Japan, it's not common to use credit card. I don't say they we don't have them is just not at common as the States or Canada.  When you have one, you always pay the next month or in 2 times only. So most people pay their stuff at the convenience store. So point cards makes more sense here.
<br />
<br />For example, I can buy something on Amazon and pay the receipt that I printed from the website at the convenience store. Same time for air plane tickets that I ordered from a website. This is more common in Japan.

<br />
<br />Yes, I finished it. It felt more like I was forcing myself to do it thought.  The game is mostly forgettable. I won't say any spoilers about the story and specific events/weapons for people that didn't play it yet.  
<br />
<br />The music doesn't grow on you and there is no such hit like the one in MM9. 
<br />
<br />The weapons are awkward in general compared to other MM but that could be debatable.  By awkward is most of the time if the weapon hit directly the enemy, it doesn't do much damage: you have to hit a wall or something. Some are hard to use more than anything that using the normal gun is the best in weapon in most scenario.
<br />
<br />The game will please any people that wants to play "just another mega man" (i.e. the hardcore fan) but it won't be anything that you will remember like MM2 and maybe MM9.  Nothing new here, just another game made very fast "a la" Capcom.
<br />
<br />Other people feel that way about it?  After finishing it, I feel like going back to MM9/2 instead.
