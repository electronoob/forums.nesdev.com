Much of the soundtrack of <em>Haunted: Halloween '85</em> has volume controlled by instruments but pitch controlled by effects, especially portamento. I haven't had time to make NSF, but an audio recording is attached to <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=157999#p157999" class="postlink">this post</a>.<br /><br />Even so, you might want, say, &quot;loud sax&quot; and &quot;quiet sax&quot; without having to double up the instrument definitions.

I thought it was enough, you can listen to decide: <a href="https://rainwarrior.bandcamp.com/album/my-lizard-is-the-lizard-of-soundtrack" class="postlink">https://rainwarrior.bandcamp.com/album/my-lizard-is-the-lizard-of-soundtrack</a><br /><br />It's this subset of Famitracker features:<br /><br />1. Instruments with volume, duty, pitch, arpeggio macros.<br />2. Volume column.<br />3. Effect F0X to control tempo (&quot;speed&quot; only, no BPM).<br />4. Effect BXX to create a loop.<br />5. Effect D00 to change the length of a pattern.<br />6. No DPCM.<br /><br /><br />Of course, if there was something else I really wanted I would have added it. Things like portamento aren't really doable as instrument macros, for example, but I simply used the pitch macros in ways that work around this, e.g. I have &quot;bend in&quot; and &quot;fall off&quot; pitch macros that don't target definite pitches but still give a similar feel to how I might use portamento in places.<br /><br />So, I mean, I totally think it's enough, but I also have a programmer's perspective. I think any decent composer can deal with what you give them, really. I mean, if they can deal with NES only having 3 melodic channels, they can deal with a few more limitations.<br /><br />The more common problem, I think, is feedback to the composer about the limitations and the data sizes they're producing. You should give them tools before they start composing that can validate that they're not using forbidden effects, preview the NSF, and show them how much data what they're doing produces, so they can learn to write &quot;small&quot;. There's probably a lot of tips you can give them on the latter, too.

I solder my own synths and in the synth community, we call what FT calls 'effect' a control change message, if digital (usually a MIDI CC), or voltage controlled parameter, if analogue. The term 'instrument' could perhaps be understood as a 'patch'. In fact, the track could be seen as self-patching and that would make sense, at least from my point of view. <br /><br />I'm still getting to know the nes architecture, but it is my so far impression that FT wasn't primarily designed with efficient hardware playback in mind. I think the GUI has some considerable work flow related flaws, too, compared to trackers like jeskola buzz (not counting the modular part).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> volume controlled by instruments but pitch controlled by effects</div><br /><br />This is what i do, too.

The term &quot;instrument&quot; is similarly common among trackers, I think starting with FastTracker and Impulse Tracker. These really are the standard terms.<br /><br />The terms you're offering come from MIDI history, kind of a completely different etymology (e.g. &quot;patch&quot; originally referring to modular synthesis setup). Trackers that combine stuff from the MIDI world, VST, etc. might end up conflating these sets of terms a bit, but most trackers use normal tracker terminology.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">WheelInventor wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">it is my so far impression that FT wasn't primarily designed with efficient hardware playback in mind</div><br />By &quot;efficient hardware playback&quot; I presume you mean suitable for use in a game, i.e. low CPU and RAM use.<br /><br />Modules made in FT can be very well suited to efficient playback, but it's not <em>limited</em> to that. In particular being able to layer a bunch of effects simultaneously lowers performance and increases the required RAM use, but if you restrict yourself to a subset (like tokumaru is asking in this thread) it's actually very good for use in a game, particularly if you export to a smaller engine like Famitone, etc.<br /><br />The NSF engine it provides isn't optimized for size or RAM use (it's designed to be flexible and useful, while being perfectly playable on hardware), which is why it's better to use your own, but the techniques and organization it uses for data are sensible, versatile, and relatively compact; very good for game use. If your performance/RAM budget allows for it, FT's NSF engine is really not all that bad, either, and it can be used directly in a game under the right circumstances. I think the engine size is about 5k and might peak at 5000 cycles or so; could be better, but isn't terrible. (A more lightweight engine might be 2k and 2000 cycles, for rough comparison.)<br /><br /><br />I've tried a ton of different chiptune trackers, and I'd actually say that Famitracker is the one that is the <em>most</em> suitable for practical use like this. What are you comparing it to? Similarly with regard to &quot;usability&quot;, there's no other chiptune tracker that I think is easier to use, or more transparently related to the hardware implementation.

Some aren't, like targeted pitch slides, which have to stop based on a comparison with the current pitch.<br /><br />In a case like vibrato, putting an envelope on top of another envelope is equivalent to implementing the effect, as far as I see it. I don't think you're saving much by trying to think of an effect as another envelope, if anything. I'd guess it would be about the same CPU cost as FT's existing vibrato, and take up more ROM space.<br /><br />In the &quot;envelopes only&quot; case, I would just have multiple instruments, one with a vibrato pitch macro, one with a flat pitch macro, and the other macros are shared data. An instrument definition by itself is small (a couple of bytes), and turning vibrato on and off is just a matter of switching instruments.<br /><br />In mine specifically: an &quot;instrument&quot; is 4 bytes, and a &quot;macro&quot; varies but the average is 15 bytes, and macros can be shared across many instruments. I had about 3000 bytes of macros, and 700 bytes of instruments in my soundtrack.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The more common problem, I think, is feedback to the composer about the limitations and the data sizes they're producing.</div><br />Did you have to go through this or did you compose the entire Lizard soundtrack yourself?</div><br />Lizard is entirely mine, but I've gone through this kind of problem on a number of projects (not limited to NES, or music), one example of which was Haunted Halloween, as mentioned above.<br /><br />If they do too much work in the dark, it's just not going to work when you turn the lights on. If you can give them the restrictions up front, but even better give them a tool they can use to validate the restrictions for themselves, you'll have less problems getting it online. I think most composers are quite willing to put up with a few arbitrary restrictions to make the implementation more efficient, but they're not happy to have to rewrite stuff they didn't realize wasn't going to work (and/or you won't be happy having to implement a bunch of extra features that could have been avoided).<br /><br />Not intending to put anyone at fault on the HH project. I don't know how it ended up in that position, or how it was managed in general; I was just hired to do my part to make it work near the end of the project. I'm merely suggesting that extra limitations like &quot;no effects&quot; are normal rules for any game project, and artists/composers should be able to cope with them-- but only if they know about them! (...and how to validate!)

As for the game's music, I made my covers along with the relevant levels, but a miscommunication between my manager and the composer made it sound like Pently itself would be extended to handle new effects.<br /><br />And yes, <a href="https://github.com/Qix-/pently/issues/4" class="postlink">I now plan to make a FamiTracker-to-Pently converter</a> in case the user wants to use FamiTracker's UI (rather than Pently's native MML- and LilyPond-inspired input format) and validate a score against Pently's limits. I just couldn't do so at the time because my time was occupied with parts of the game other than music, and I can't do so now because my time is occupied with the sequel.

I was somehow getting the impression that since i could do near perfect covers of many different games with supposedly different native game engines, an engine like that, which is able to 'do it all' would be bloated, but if performance cost can be held down by restrictive use, then that's indeed very reasonable. <br /><br />Regarding comparison to other trackers, my main reference is said Jeskola Buzz which is the one i've stuck with since 2004 or so, when other daw software and/or sequencers doesn't cut it, mainly because the workflow and layout is extremely good, especially in the traditional tracker part of it. Of course, it's no good for nes music. But i miss how fast and clean you can edit your song or frame or loop during playback, compared to FT. <br /><br />Regarding file format, is famitone or any or all of the other engines that have been released to the community assuming that unless an instruction states otherwise, the track or frame stays the same? (for example, track 3 played frame 5, so it will play frame 5 the next frame switch, too, unless there's new data) Or is it more like 'do this for that long time'? This may not be the greatest issue, but documentation like that might be handy when composing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, I consider Jeskola Buzz a very unusual tracker. Definitely geared toward modular synthesis and MIDI kind of interfaces. I think its way of handling patterns is a little abnormal too, but it works fine.<br /><br />Famitracker is unusual in its own ways too, but I find it works really well once you're oriented. I really do think it's the best chiptune tracker I've used; there are a lot of others at this point.<br /><br /><br />Famitracker has an &quot;order&quot; specified per-channel. By order, I mean a list of &quot;patterns&quot; to play (by number) that make up the song's order. If, for example, you want the noise channel to play a repeating drum pattern, you can enter the same number multiple times in the order.
