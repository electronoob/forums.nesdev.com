<br />
<br />Yes.  I can plow through Battletoads like nobody's business.  While I can't say I can beat it without dying, I can say I can beat it without ever dropping below 5 lives (except at the start where you start with less than 5).
<br />
<br />The difficulty of Battletoads is greatly overrated.  There are many much, much harder games out there.  Ghosts 'n' Goblins is one of them.  Rolling Thunder is another.

<br />Farthest I ever got in Battletoads was the level with the hypno orb.  Although I did manage to get the "no enemies" crash on the rat race level.  That pissed me off.

<br />
<br />I did screw up in a couple of spots, but oh well, the game is designed as such where it's hard to do the <em>exact</em> same thing every time. Not for all levels, but for some parts of levels, that is.
<br />
<br />Anyway, it's kinda long, but a good time killer I guess : P

<br />
<br />I've played through all of it.  Fire Zone is one of the harder ones -- notably the part with the fireballs and missiles.  Though you can "cheat" to dodge most of the missles (sticking to the very bottom makes you immune to the missles that come in from bottom -- just have to watch out for the ones that come from the ceiling)

<br />In that case, people have cleared Through the Fire and Flames on Expert in Guitar Hero III. Is Battletoads harder than that?

<br />The PAL version just runs slower, so you have more time to react to stuff.
<br />The Japanese version always starts you off with 5 lives, and simplifies some levels (such as the Turbo Tunnel and Elevator Shaft).

<br />Wow, that has to be the only time that has ever happened. You've got SMB2 that they released in Japan and they said it was too hard for americans, then they released a super easy version of Final Fantasy IV here and had both that one and a HARD version over there. Well, was Battletoads made in the US?

<br />
<br />Did they also make Commando for the NES?  Not sure, but I felt it resembled Ikari Warriors a little too much, &amp; they were released by different companies.
