Is CopyNES required to do a boot ROM upgrade?  If so, I will definitely not be buying until enough time has passed to ensure there are no issues with the boot ROM code.  (I probably won't be getting one of the first 100 anyway, mainly due to price.)
<br />
<br />The only issue that still bothers me (though it only affects a small number of games) is INES header ambiguity.  How (if at all) does the Power PAK handle SOROM and SXROM boards (MMC1 variants with 16K/32K of WRAM)?  Also, how is the MMC6 distinguished from the MMC3 (are StarTropics 1 and 2 playable)?  If NES 2.0 ever got anywhere, this would be easier to deal with (whatever happened to NES 2.0 anyway?).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Does the boot ROM configure the FPGA?  If so, it would definitely be a good idea to allow for the boot ROM to be upgrade via a special program placed on the compact flash card, so that users can update the boot ROM without a CopyNES.  Otherwise, I'd suggest only selling the first batch to people who already own a CopyNES.  People that own a CopyNES will be more technically inclined, and capable of upgrading the boot ROM in order to fix incompatibilities.  Then the later batches can be sold to more casual gamers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It would seem to me it must be software configurable through the CF card and PC with a card reader. Once something like this requires another third party device, you start peeling off potential users and splinter/dilute demand.
<br />
<br />If possible, it's best to reduce the likelihood of V.1, v 1.5 etc hardware revisions as much as possible. Unless the goal here is to truly only serve the needs of the most hardcore of NES users (a subset of a subset of a subset of gamers!)
<br />
<br />Better a delay, than a crippled, completely commercially un-viable first version, at least IMO. The community can very quickly turn negative on a project, just from perceptions. For  bunnyboy's and his projects sake, this hopefully won't occur.
<br />
<br />Also, I think bunnyboy should be permitted to charge a price that allows him to make a few bucks, if not now, hopefully in the future. Hard work has value. No one here has really complained, and hopefully they don't. It is obvious many many hours have been poured into this.
<br />
<br />Bravo!

<br />If the flash carts read iNES 2.0 ROMs, then this definitely isn't a problem as long as the boot ROM has this implemented and can programm the FPGA to emulate the MMC1 with different pin functions.
