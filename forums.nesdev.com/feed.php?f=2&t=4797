Banshuku and Petruza, have you guys ever tried Open tUME?  It's a really nice editor that would work well, it previously was a commercial program used for making quite a few console games.  For all it's features, I found it easy to use (w/ the tutorials).<br /><br />I remember messing around with it, I liked it a lot.  But by the time I realized how much would be involved with doing the data conversion, for my project at the time I was just be happier to make real progress by forming the data in a hex editor.  Then later I made my own half-assed map editor that runs on NES.  Plus I didn't know any languages besides assembly at the time.  The author didn't have the files for the NES data format converter anymore.<br /><br />Maybe it's not useful to you, but it may be worth checking out, in any event.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Jan 30, 2009 4:13 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm with Celius. Using a more versatile tool for drawing (in this case, MSPaint) and converting later is much better than using editors with limited drawing capabilities. Graphics that are drawn directly in tile editors usually look kinda poor.<br /></div><br />Well I've always used tile editors personally. Altough I have to admit I really don't like much to draw graphics. It's probably the worst part into doing a game, and what refrains me the most from advancing. Having anything look good just takes forever. Only enemies' AI is worse.<br /><br />The problem I see which using paint is that it would be very easy to mess up and have graphics that don't align in 8x8 pixels or sometihg. With photoshop I guess it's not freeware and I don't have it so... I have another programm called Picture Publisher which is similar but I never figured how to use it. It does only add effects to images but you can't make images from scratch I guess.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jan 30, 2009 2:27 am</p><hr />

I tried it once, with a few Java-based map editors. The main problem I found though was that all of them would only let me place single metatiles on the map. That made it impossible to easily reuse larger blocks of data, something essential for my compression scheme to work.<br /><br />Maybe a really useful editor could allow the user to define chunks of arbitrary sizes that can later be placed anywhere in the map. That would make many levels of nested blocks possible, and would also help in object-based compression schemes. The final output would probably still be just a grid of metatiles, and the conversion script would have to detect all the used structures in order to compress the map, but that's better than nothing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jan 29, 2009 9:32 pm</p><hr />

But first,  I need to create a very minimalist version (map/metatile support only) for the first alpha that can generate data and see how well it can be integrated on the nes.

The deal with generic tools is that they can't take those sacrifices into consideration, nor the type of gameplay you want to achieve.

This is why most serious projects need custom tools.<br /></div><br /><br />I see your point but the need I'm trying to fill is the lack of a visual editor for your map/metatile etc. editing needs.  There is none where I can easily generate some generic data that I can parse easily. Of course there exist some tile editor but I never found one that is appropriate for the nes.  So my first goal is to create the "view" of that editor, something generic to create what will be seen on the screen.   Then, regarding the data format, depending of your need, a generic version will be generated and you will require some post processing because every person engine needs are different.  If we can create that visual editor, that will already be a big plus.  The data exported could be in .db format or xml, or even a plug-in interface could allow the user to create is own format.<br /><br />Regarding the metatile, you will be able to define your own attributes for your metatile set. Then on every metatile, you can select which one is appropriate.  So the editor won't have a default list of attribute, you have to define them.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I make my own tools when I need to handle complex data formats, but they are usually simple command line applications without any sort of error handling.
