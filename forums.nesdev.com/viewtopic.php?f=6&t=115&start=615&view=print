<br />
<br />I have a question for you: Why does the Flying Warriors .nsf play slowly?  If you're not familiar with the game, play it a bit then go check the .nsf; the .nsf file will play slower.  I tried the Hiryuu no Ken .nsf files and they all seem to be fine and play at the normal speed.  What would be causing this?  Flying Warriors is easily in my top 10 NES games, and it's really annoying having the soundtrack play incorrectly.  I was hoping that since you obviously have technical knowledge and a good understanding of the .nsf file, maybe you could explain this.  Thanks again for your time.

<br />
<br />Akumajou Dracula actually had the same music as the regular NES version, so that request is invalid.
<br />
<br />However, I haven't seen famicom based Zelda no Densetsu ripped yet, and 3d World Runner as well.
<br />
<br />In addition, there's the homebrew Super Contra 7, Big Bird's Hide and Speak, and Rare's work on Sesame Street ABC/123.
<br />
<br />Fester's Quest game over theme still doesn't play properly.  The drum parts are fine after the second bit, but the high pitched sound that plays at that part shouldn't be there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I ripped the sesame street NSFs from distinct ROMs, and didn't notice there being 3 song inits and 3 play routines for 1 game. The idea of needing 3 distinct song init and play routines for 1 NSF isn't something I've run into before, and seems like a very hacked together bit of programming. I thought the second init/play set was where I had hit the speed bump, but no, it was the third set of routines...
<br />Updated Sesame Street ABC - 123 with the additional tracks. I'll leave both rips up.
<br />
<br />In 'Fester's Quest', get a game over close to where you start the game, then check that sound effect against the one in the NSF. I believe you'll find them to be a close match. If you die while underground, the effect will sound a little different, but I believe it to be a programming error on the part of the game designers.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />I just checked every NSF on my site for missing DPCM data, and found out I'd forgotten to add it to New Ghostbusters 2. I also fixed the starting song number in Foton.
