Oh yea, I should have mentioned that. My Yobo outputs 4.7 V when I use the supplied wall wart. Using my own 5.5v wall wart it outputs over 5v, but not quite 5.5v. I never tested the leads on the warts, I should probably do that.<br /><br />Anyway, I did notice that CV3 does not boot at all when using the wall wart supplied with the Yobo (goes to grey screen). It does boot when using mine, but fails to enter game play due to the CIRAM bug.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Tue Aug 09, 2011 8:26 am</p><hr />

I did some test now that I got back my Yobo NOAC clone and it definitely look like the clone is not outputting as much power as a real Nintendo system. I don't have exact value as I did it in a rush this afternoon but voltage was lower on the clone.<br /><br />Still no luck yet running the cart on real nes though!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Mon Aug 08, 2011 7:59 pm</p><hr />

But when you have a split CHR ROM (e.g. <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_068#Hardware" class="postlink">mapper 68</a>), or both CHR ROM and CHR RAM (e.g. <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/TQROM" class="postlink">TQROM</a> or <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/INES_Mapper_192" class="postlink">its Chinese clone</a>), or allowing nametables and pattern tables to share one memory as Memblers mentioned (also mapper 68), you need the mapper to postprocess the PA10-PA13 to come up with the enables for CHR memories.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Jul 30, 2011 6:15 am</p><hr />

I didn't check the datasheet for this part, but the 2nd CE line almost certainly a positive-enable, so it being at +5V has it enabled (both CE's must be enabled).<br /><br />So if the VCC pin for the RAM is at 5V, then I guess they were running the original 3V RAM chip at that.. strange.<br /><br />There's nothing stopping the mapper from taking CHR A13 (or /A13) and then having it's own output to the CHR /CE on the RAM.  The only reason I can think of for doing that, is if the mapper was also controlling the "CIRAM /CE", then it could map nametables into it's the cart's CHR-RAM (which would allow 4-screen mode, and nametable banking, which are kinda rare features).<br /><br />I wonder, is the voltage of the clone really 5V?  Maybe NES maskROMs and mappers can run at 3.3V, I can't say I've tried it or would know what to expect.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Sat Jul 30, 2011 2:39 am</p><hr />

For the mapper to have complete control of /CE the mapper basically doesn't give control where it belongs.  If this is really the case it's a backasswards design and super difficult to time properly.  I'm suprised it even works in a clone...  Based on the fact you're getting different glitches every time supports the possibility of a timing issue, since the Mapper can't very well know what to do with /CE when.  <br /><br />I'd be curious what would happen if you connected CHR A13 to the spare /CE2 that's currently tied to Vcc.  If it wasn't obvious you'd want to make sure you cut a trace or somehow removed it from Vcc, you could double check by checking the resistance of the CHR A13 line to Vcc afterwards and ensure it wasn't low (like less than 1K ohms).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Fri Jul 29, 2011 11:32 pm</p><hr />

So I've actually got a similar failure with the horizontal lines playing around with my kazzo and a SRAM NROM cart.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/img/images/thwaite.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It turns out dumping the cart and comparing hex files, that the very first byte in CHR memory is corrupt.  It's 0xA0 and supposed to be 0x00.  I still haven't figured out why exactly.  But I had a similar problem where the first byte in PRG memory was programming improperly.  It ended up fixing it's self when I realized the retrozone cart I was using had the /CE line on the PRG memory tied to GND.  So basically anything that was being write controlled by PRG /CE was failing, but writes that were controlled by PRG /WR were working properly.  Connecting the /CE pin to PRG /CE actually fixed a lot of other problems I had too with corrupt data and in ability to battery back my SRAM well also.<br /><br />I don't know if all this helps much but it's one way I was able to get horizonal lines with a completely different setup.  My error is in the writing process to the SRAM not reading it.  Basically it makes me think that it's corrupting data for something like the first byte of several or most tiles or something.  That gives a horizontal line and the follow on bytes of the tile or block of memory program properly.  IDK I'm making a lot of guesses on how things are actually working but it sounds possible to me atleast.<br /><br />When you checked all the lines did you compare it to the pin out of the SRAM?  Like did you ensure the /CE line is actually connected to CHR A13 on the cart edge?  I would recommend checking all the control signals making sure they make sense where they wire them up.  That's basically why I had issues, the board is designed for EPROM or FLASH where it wouldn't be an issue grounding /CE and not letting the NES actually enable the chip.  But it caused hell with my SRAM even though the pinout was the same.  I know it's a different story on the CHR side with VRAM and all but it atleast gives you something to look at.  Perhaps if I find my error on the CHR side it'll be related to yours as well, I haven't figured out why I'm having an issue with that first byte...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Thu Jul 28, 2011 1:40 am</p><hr />

The corruption pattern can change when I power cycle or reset the NES. The picture of the menu after the mode is one of the lucky time it wasn't so bad. I even was able to briefly get an almost perfect menu yesterday but when I booted a game is was as unplayable. I tough it might be the connection with the 60 to 72 pic adapter even though I tested with multimeter so to completely rule that out I soldered it directed to one of the adapter like this:<br /><br /><a href="http://skinnyv.com/Cart/245in1/Direct_Connect.JPG" class="postlink">http://skinnyv.com/Cart/245in1/Direct_Connect.JPG</a><br /><br />Test each connection with a multimeter for continuity and for short. All was perfect. Tested it ion my NES, corrupted graphic, and not the nice one like on the picture. I must say it is a very strange cart. <br /><br />So I'm at a loss once again:) By the way, I was still wondering about the VCC, I've been instructed to lift the RAM's VCC pin and connect to +5v on edge connector but I don't think it was running on 3V at all, it seem to be connected directly to pin 30 of the Famicom edge connector which, as far as I know is 5v...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Wed Jul 27, 2011 10:04 pm</p><hr />

I did test for continuity and everything seem good. As for the pattern there are not really horizontal, it really depend because the corruption can vary on the menu. As for lowering voltage I'm not really sure how to achieve that safely.  But one thing is that I managed to get an almost perfect menu yesterday so I'll see if the adapter is not responsible for the rest of the corruption as the edge pin connector of those pirate carts are really short. I might try to solder the cart directly to the adapter to rule out the bad contact theory even though I tested most of the pin for continuity and didn't see a problem.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4859">SkinnyV</a> — Wed Jul 27, 2011 9:33 am</p><hr />
