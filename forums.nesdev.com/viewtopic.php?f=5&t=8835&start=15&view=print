<br />Would it be less wrong to download only viewtopic.php, with topics in increasing order, and step through the 9,000 or so t= numbers (and the following pages)? I think I have enough Python-fu to scrape NESdev BBS 1.0 (wwwThreads) and NESdev BBS 2.0 (phpBB 2 based) intelligently and turn them into a usable archive.

<br />This is still an issue on your end. While the site is slow for others (what do you expect? It kind of outgrew the original space...) it doesn't have nearly the kind of issues that you have.
<br />
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br />But to expand on what Drag said, TCRF uses a VPS outside of the place the other web hosting goes. If I ended up hosting it it'd be alongside the other sites on my DH account (rustedlogic.net, xkeeper.net, dreamandfriends.com, etc). So basically it's the same thing you suggested, piggybacking onto someone's DH account.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />(Before anybody asks, I would not take any role in the site other than emergency maintenance in the event something happened server-side that needs to be fixed immediately. I have pretty much no stake or care in how these forums are run, other than the fact that I and a few others find it to be a useful resource of knowledge from time to time.)
<br />
<br />
<br />It makes no difference what is decided, and since there are a little over 5 months left before the hosting ends you have a lot of time to consider your choices.

<br />I appreciate your consideration. I just put up a top-level <a href="http://blargg.parodius.com/index2.html" class="postlink">index</a> so you can at least mirror everything except temp/. I need to go through temp to remove anything that was meant for particular people only.

<br />
<br />This is making the assumption that the reason is monetary, and since it's probably not (otherwise he would've made his reasons clear) I don't think it's worth trying to talk him out of it.  It's ok, it seems a half dozen possible solutions are already floating around.
