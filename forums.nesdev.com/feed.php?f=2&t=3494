I'd still recommand doing the following (that's what I'm doing in my game and it works well) :<br />- First call the inteligence routine of all objects, including player and everything, and do not maze the sprites at all.<br />- Have a routine sort the different objects in function of what they are to be sorted.<br />- Have a routine that maze the sprites of the objects in function of the data given by the routine that sorted them. (also note that one thing you can do here is have some object their "left" part mazed first then their right part on even frame, and the other way arround on odd frames for more cycling).<br /><br />In my current project, I sort the object in function of their vertical position, because the view is top-down, so it's important to have stuff that is on the bottom of the screen mazed with higher priority that stuff that is high on the screen. In the case of a platformer, the order could just be random or anything. In my current project I also treat explosions and this kind of stuff (that I've called myself "Graphic SFX" in my source code) first prior to anything, so they will be above all. If you treat "Graphic SFX" like normal objects (wich my game engine dont, but maybe yours does) then you can have your sorting routine take this into account and made them prior to the exploding object.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jul 26, 2007 10:27 am</p><hr />

I'm still having a hard time figuring out how to cycle sprites while still keeping some of them properly layered (on top of each other).<br /><br />I have thought about cycling objects instead of sprites, so I'd process them in "random" order, starting at a "random" location in the OAM buffer, but render full objects at once, using sequential sprites for the same object, in a way that layering will be respected.<br /><br />The problem occurs when wrapping from the end of the buffer back to the beginning in the middle of an object, in which case layering will not be respected (sprites that should have lower priority will end up with higher priority). The solution could be checking if there is enough space for an object's sprites before the end of the buffer, and if there isn't, not use that space and go back to the beginning prematurely, wasting a few sprite slots. Yeah, it sucks having to waste slots, but looking for another object that will fit in the avaliable space will just take too much time.<br /><br />Anyway, I still have to test all of this out. I'll let you know when I find a good way to do this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jul 25, 2007 6:58 am</p><hr />

Some games, including Final Fantasy, does not touch $2003 at all. Most games just write zero to it once at startup or once before each sprite-DMA.<br />Having two pages for sprites is doable, and Kirby's Adventure does this. I, however, find this is an ineficiant way to do things : You calculate your sprites for two frames and write it in twice as much RAM as the normal way would (use the same page, but just cycle the sprite inside it).<br />To actually cycle the sprites there is several methods : Just reverse the order, place some sprite in higher priority then get the other in an order that is reversed each frames, or just place the priorities randomly, etc...<br />A method I found that is great is instead to have your sprite index start at 0 and increase by 4 each sprite you fill in the OAM buffer, increase it with any multiple of 4 that is not a multiple of 8. This will fill the sprites in a different order, and each time it will still use all the 64 available. Additionally, this allows you to always start at zero to use sprite-zero hits, and have all 63 other sprites follow a "random" order.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jul 25, 2007 12:38 am</p><hr />

I'm writing a cycling routine for a sports game engine I've been working on. There can be up to 45 8x16 sprites on any given scanline at any given time (though not very likely). Of those, 44 are for players and need to be cycled.<br /><br />So my idea was to have 2 separate $58 byte "pages" within the OAM page. For every frame, toggle which team uses which page (so priority between teams changes) as well as keep an index on what player to start the copy (from player struct ram to OAM ram) from. The index would be increased on every frame so priority among teamates changes too. The effectiveness has yet to be tested (the ai hasn't progressed far enough).<br /><br />I was just wondering what techniques others have used/seen.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=187">never-obsolete</a> — Thu Jul 19, 2007 1:10 pm</p><hr />
