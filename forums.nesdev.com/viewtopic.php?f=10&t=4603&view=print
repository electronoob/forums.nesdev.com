<br /> I want to make some sprites that I can use as a resource when I get started with this stuff. 
<br />What do I need to know to make some raw sprites?
<br />
<br />What I want to know is what do I do if I wanted to make NES sprites if I used Adobe Photoshop? Cant I just save an eight color PNG or something and use tilelayer or tilemolester?
<br />
<br />I think I'm asking too much questions. Sorry. Just wanted to know this since I'm new to this whole thing.

<br />
<br />I actually use a combination of photoshop and paint. I'm not so knowledgeable with photoshop, so if I do rotations and stuff, I don't know how to stop it from putting all sorts of grain all over the image. With this in mind, I rotate something, trace over it in paint (paint just has a more simple interface for tracing things), and change the colors to red, green, and blue with photoshop to copy it into YY-CHR.

<br />Have you tried <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/RotSprite" class="postlink">RotSprite</a>? It's made specifically for rotating sprites and it's guesses are usually pretty good. Most of the time you only need very little tweaking on the images after they've been rotated by this program.

<br />I use Photoshop exclusively. If anyone ever has any questions about Photoshop, feel free to PM me.
<br />
<br />I haven't posted in a while because I've been working on a level editor, which concerns Win32 programming more than NES programming. But I still lurk and would like to contribute somehow, so bring on those inquiries!

<br />It's a Bulbasaur doing SolarBeam with "Hello World" as the caption.
<br />I don't have know any File hosts to upload on so I just rendered a bitmap.
<br />This is some pretty easy stuff. I'm pretty sure the Nes would have a hard time processing the image though.

<br />
<br />That's my biggest complaint about YY-CHR. I wish it would allow for something like copy everything but color #0. I have portraits that are 64x96 pixels in my game that are layered with sprites, so I'd like to work with layers in that. But I suppose if I'm really so annoyed, I'll just make an application one day that'll fit my needs.
