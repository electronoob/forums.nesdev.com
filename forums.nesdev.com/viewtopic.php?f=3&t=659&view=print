Now every passenger had the ability to do this at the same time and I doubt VERY MUCH that the airplane had 250 Super Nintendo consoles tucked away somewhere each with it's own F-Zero or Super Mario Kart with the stewardesses running around hopelessly switch cartridges whenever a passenger wanted to play a different game. So there can be only one possibility, the plane was running an emulator, most probably from Nintendo themselves.
<br />
<br />Considering that the fasest NES emu out there needs at least a Pentium 150-200mhz, multiplying that number by 300 would require a lot of processing power so no doubt the emulator itself would have to be VERY fast.
<br />
<br />Ok, here is what I am proposing people. Quietist can be the brains behind it, I'll chat up the blonde security guard, whilst blargg takes care of the two policemen guarding the doors, whilst disch sneaks on board and steals the computers hard-drive. Up for it guys?
<br />
<br />SERIOUSLY now, does anyone have any information on this?

<br />If I were designing that system I would probably have about 50 SNES cpu/ppu pairs on a big board (or on separate cards that slide into a backplane), and replace their cart connectors with ram.  A muxing system could route one SNES to each seat in the cabin, betting that no more than 50 people at a time would want to play at once.
<br />I could be wrong, but my bet is that there is no emulation being done in that system.

No doubt if we were to write off to an airline or hotel they would probably tell us to get stuffed if we requested a copy of the emulator (if one is used).

<br />
<br /> " The games on [company] aircraft are only offerable where the In-flight Entertainment system has audio-video-on-demand. The games are loaded on a central server. Should a guest wish to play a game, the game is downloaded to a box at the seat and the game appears on the in-seat screen. The game controls are integrated with the handset which is used to access the in-flight entertainment system, i.e. no additional handset is required " . 
<br />
<br />Does this answer your question?

<br />It doesn't work excluding official emulator though ". qd" file is just like the FDS file.

<br />So we may have at least one excuse against UNIF fans who claim that iNES is only a legacy format.
<br />
<br />As for "qd": That stands for QuickDisk, the underlying physical layer format of FDS disks. If the .qd files don't work in (say) fdsloader, then perhaps either 1. the KYODAKU file is wrong or 2. the games were "trained" to run on the official emulator. (Many of the Classic NES Series games were "trained" in much the same way.)

<br />
<br />ok.. and what happen if you have a powerful machine.. and you code a emulator on assembler.. or just assembler 6502!! and all powerful hardware is 6502.. and emu and hw is only dedicated to emulation (not show fps, not show cheats, now show pattern tables??)..
<br />
<br />it dont be powerful and with a incredible speed???
<br />
<br />a crazy idea... but.. i think so..

<br />
<br />I know this comment is tounge-in-cheek, but it does bring up an interesting point:  Has anyone actually <em>tried</em> to contact Nintendo regarding hobby development in any capacity?  I'd be curious to know what their stance is on all that.
