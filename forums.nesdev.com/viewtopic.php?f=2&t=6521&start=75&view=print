<br />Yeah, all my PAL testing is done on emulators. I believe most TVs can handle PAL just fine though, but importing a PAL NES just for testing programs is a bit too much for me.

<br />That's the single reason why I have a TV system check on the first screen of LJ65. If the TV system doesn't match the TV system for which the build's speed constants are intended, then it puts up a TV system mismatch error message and freezes. (Yes, I complain about the NTSC PS2 not converting the TV system of all-region PAL DVDs, but it's also hundreds of times faster than the NES.)

<br />
<br />Actually, things are working very well on hardware, and not so much on emulators. On hardware, the variation is only 24 pixels or so, an area that can be easily hidden in HBlank, but both Nintendulator and Nestopia have occasional frames every few seconds where the variation goes up to 56 or so pixels, the split point happens much earlier than normal for some unknown reason.

<br />The way in which the first sample is started makes a lot of difference it seems... I was having some sudden timing variations (40 some pixels) every few seconds, and out of desperation, I tried different things and this is what proved to be most stable, both on emulators and real hardware (while experimenting I found other combinations that worked either on hardware or emulators, but this is the only one that seems to work for both):

<br />Yup, three $4015 writes in a row. Don't ask me why. Does anyone have any theories on why this is the case? Most importantly, do you thing this could have some undesired side effect?

<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">IRQ&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DMA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Buffer&nbsp; Output<br />-------------------------------<br />0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;empty&nbsp; &nbsp;busy<br />STA $4015<br />0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;empty&nbsp; &nbsp;busy<br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;full&nbsp; &nbsp; busy<br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;empty&nbsp; &nbsp;new cycle<br />STA $4015<br />0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;empty&nbsp; &nbsp;busy<br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;full&nbsp; &nbsp; busy &lt;-- this was the problem<br />STA $4015<br />0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;full&nbsp; &nbsp; busy<br />...<br />0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;full&nbsp; &nbsp; busy<br />0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;empty&nbsp; &nbsp;new cycle<br />1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;full&nbsp; &nbsp; busy<br />IRQ at proper time</div>
<br />
<br />At the beginning, the DMA unit has nothing to fetch, the one-byte buffer is empty, and the output unit is almost done with its current cycle.
<br />
<br />After the first STA $4015, the DMA unit has one byte to fetch, which it does immediately. This fills the sample buffer, and sets the IRQ flag. Just after that, the output unit completes its cycle and empties the sample buffer.
<br />
<br />By the time of the second STA $4015, the sample buffer is empty again, and thus it gets immediately filled and the IRQ flag set almost immediately again. If you had done the CLI after this, the IRQ would have been delayed until after the instruction AFTER the CLI (due to the way the 6502 effectively delays clearing the I flag by one instruction). So your IRQ would be late.
<br />
<br />But if you instead do a third STA $4015, you are ensured that the output unit is busy and the sample buffer full, so that you don't get an immediate IRQ.
<br />
<br />It's nice to have others working on new techniques like this and experimenting until they work well on hardware. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I'm not sure. The PAL version was exactly like the NTSC one, the only difference was how many scanlines apart the interrupts were, since I wanted to use a frequency that would result in intervals close to whole scanlines, to waste as few cycles as possible.
<br />
<br />I never finished this for good, because I lost interest in this technique when I realized that about 20% of a frame's time would be spent on a single split. I'll check the files though (I don't even remember where they are, but I'm sure there's a backup somewhere) and will share whatever I have. The code is far from clean though, there were still a lot of little things left to do before this could be considered a reusable piece of code. A problem I could never solve is that once in a while there would be sudden variations of 40 or so pixels, which could easily screw up scrolling changes.
<br />
<br />Now that I think of it, I might have even made a single program that is NTSC &amp; PAL compatible, based on console detection at startup. I'm sure I had plans for this, but I'll have to check if I actually implemented it. I'll let you know later today.

<br />Aah, I remembered there was a catch to this. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Do you think it would be possible to cut down on the CPU usage if one was more clever about the choice of frequencies/etc?
<br />
<br />On another note, even if a generic routine can't be made efficiently, it would still be useful to have good documentation and/or an ("offline") application to generate code for DMC timed splits based on input parameters.

But the letterbox demo (two fixed split points) uses 20 IRQs per frame, most of which take only about 36 cycles (if I remember correctly) to handle. Even counting other overheads, I imagine it's taking less than 5% of CPU time. I'd have to profile it harder to get a more precise figure.

<br />I found the most recent archive of my work on this (and it appears I was working on PAL compatibility the last time I touched it, because the assembled ROM works on PAL but not on NTSC), but I'm having trouble uploading it using the ftp Memblers set up for me. I'll try again after dinner.

<br />
<br />I think the CPU usage is about 9 scanlines, plus a few more because of the imperfetion of the lenght/duration ratio (you'll have to use the one which will fire an IRQ just before the desired split point, and wait the remaining time the old way).
<br />So I'll say 10 scanlines, which is about 4% CPU time in NTSC.

<br />Because we have to measure how long it takes for the first IRQ to fire (so that this difference is used to compensate the timing later), and if you use a larger interval you'll waste a lot of time waiting for this IRQ to happen.

<br />I already do play a longer sample through much of the big area. But the only sample lengths one can reasonably use for this are 1 and 17 bytes.
