		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure if it is a bug with some logic with my emulator or if games actually edit ROM or access out of range address, expecting some behavior which is not implemented.<br /><br />When running Super Mario Bros, I see that the code tries to edit the pattern tables. When running Ice Climber, I see it trying to access a VRAM address greater than 0x4000. Both occur when writing to 0x2007 and both cause my emulator to crash.<br />This is how I handle a write to 0x2007:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">mem.setVRAM8(this-&gt;currentVramAddr++, this-&gt;DATA);<br />this-&gt;currentVramAddr += ((this-&gt;CTRL &gt;&gt; 2) &amp; 0x1) * 31; // Ads extra 31 if bit 2 is set<br /></div><br />Is this supposed to happen in those games or is something wrong with my implementation? My CPU passes all the tests from nestest and instr_test-v5.  My PPU passes all of blargg's tests (blargg_ppu_tests_2005.09.15b) except for vbl_clear_time if I allow the code to edit CHR.<br /><br />Another interesting thing to note is that everything works perfectly fine in Release mode in Visual Studio. Both Super Mario Bros and Ice Climber seem to work mostly fine, except for some sprites being all black, but I'm pretty sure that it is unrelated to this issue.

I made it overflow after reaching 0x4000 and made writing to ROM a nop.<br /><br />I also figured out why it was working in Release, but not Debug. It was because I didn't initialize the PPU registers, and they got set to values that caused an NMI on the first cycle, stopping the CPU from running initialization code and messing everything up. I simply initialized them to 0 and made the changes you suggested and it worked! Thanks for the help!<br /><br />However, on the scrolling page on the <a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_scrolling#PPU_internal_registers" class="postlink">wiki</a>, it says that the VRAM address is 15 bits long. Is that talking about a different address?

Is a reset just a way to change the ROM without resetting all of the registers, and on a physical device without turning it on and off?</div><br />The NES and famicom have two separate buttons: POWER and RESET.<br /><br />The power switch removes power from the system and turns it off. The reset button doesn't turn anything off, it just restarts the software from the beginning.<br /><br />A lot of stuff that was happening, most contents of RAM, etc. is preserved across a reset that is not preserved when you power off. Some games will behave differently for a reset than for powering off and on, though I think most games will be the same either way.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You <em>can</em> yank a cartridge out of your NES while it's on, if you want, but that's not really something I've ever seen emulated. You can also do that while holding reset, I suppose?<br /><br />If you pull a cartridge out of the machine while it's powered on, the system will more or less just crash. You can stick a new game in without powering it off, but to get it to run you will need to press reset (or power off and on).<br /><br />There's some <a href="http://metopal.com/2012/09/12/the-famicom-cart-swap-trick/" class="postlink">obscure possibilities</a> involved with this, but emulators can usually do the same thing in a more convenient way with game genie codes or other methods.

You can implement it as powering on all 0, all FF, all random, doesn't really matter.<br /><br />There are usually some pattern tendencies to any particular RAM's power on, but it will vary a bit from time to time your turn it on.
