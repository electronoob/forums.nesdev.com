Some of this is getting out of hand, so I'll let you cool off. I know you have a lot of claims to make, but they'd be more persuasive with evidence.<br /><br /><strong>If you want to show technical superiority of a particular platform:</strong><br />Code equivalent demos or mini-games for each platform, provide source code, and show how one platform uses substantially more CPU time for an equivalent workload or what has to be left out to fit it all into video memory. Be prepared to see the other side take it as a friendly optimization challenge to improve the public's knowledge of efficient graphics engine design.<br /><br /><strong>If you want to use the lack of a port of a particular game as evidence:</strong><br />Not every licensed console game developer in the fourth generation had the budget to train its programmers in techniques that are effective on both platforms. Some were even under exclusive contract to a particular console maker. And most of us are unlikely to outlive the game's team by 70 years.<br /><br /><strong>If you want to discuss how to promote a demo to the public:</strong><br />Open a new topic for that in General Stuff. Make sure to stay on the topic of promotion, not bickering about technical superiority.<br /><br />Until then:<br /><br /><a href="http://carebears.wikia.com/wiki/Secret_Bear" class="postlink"><img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/carebears/images/5/5a/Secret_Bear.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120405173522" alt="Image" /><br />Talk to the belly badge.</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Feb 24, 2015 11:04 am</p><hr />

Meanwhile I'm thinking we should have an entire separate forum exclusively for arguing about which console is better, just so that people like Stef can pick their fights there and we can spend our time here focusing on how to actually get things done...<br /><br />We've had 20 years to fight about which one is superior.  If there still isn't a clear answer after all that then this kind of speculative forum bickering is certainly not going to sway me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6817">Khaz</a> — Tue Feb 24, 2015 10:52 am</p><hr />

It was probably a bad idea to redraw sprites to compensate for the SNES's pixel aspect ratio.  I could probably whip up a usable sprite sheet for Gunstar Heroes, if I use the original sprites.

Also as a reminder you are here on a Nintendo forum so it's not the best place to advocate the Megadrive (not that we have anything against that machine of course).<br /></div> <br /> <br />My message a bit overreacted but please avoid things like that : <br /> <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I seriously think it's ridiculous how they talk about how high and mighty the Genesis is and that games like Gunstar Heroes would never be able to be on the SNES when games that are just as impressive, if not more so, can exist on the SNES like Space Megaforce or Rendering Ranger <br /><br />... <br />One think that's always amazed me is that no one has tried to make a port of Sonic the Hedgehog on the SNES... (It's easily doable.)<br /></div> <br /><br />For me that is just mis-informations... I often read the 65816 is able to compete with the 68000 and that's just matters of code optimization, well code optimization also exists for the 68000 and if you use very optimized code on the 68000 then you won't be able to reproduce it on 65816 whatever are your efforts. If you can do RR² with the stock 65816 then you will be able to push about twice as much with the 68000, that is as simple than that.<br />It's as true than the fact the Megadrive has only 4 palettes of 16 colors and whatever are your efforts you won't be able to display as colorful graphics then you can have on Snes.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'll just say that you're severely overstating what's going on in Gunstar Heroes. The physics are actually extremely simple, and every enemy is basically box collision + those simple physics + some really dumb AI. Do you seriously think that's impressive? =/ (and it's not like the fancy effects require that much processing either, they're more about being clever)<br /></div><br /><br />And i think you are *really* under estimating it...<br />To be honest i don't like much the game but technically it's definitely an awesome achievement.<br />Just in first level, try to play it in hardest mode and see how much the screen is loaded... Nothing comes close to that on SNES, and i would say that even on NeoGeo you don't have much game with such intense action.<br />Dozen of ennemies, complexes explosions with particules physics, even your weapons can use advanced cinetics.<br />And that's in real game situation with a complexe sprite engine, collision code and so on, something different from a simple demo.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6058">Stef</a> — Tue Feb 24, 2015 8:26 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What's <em>Speedy Gonzales: Los Gatos Bandidos</em> (Sunsoft/WB/Acclaim) other than a reimplementation of <em>Sonic</em> with a different character?<br /></div><br />But that's one reimplementation that didn't turn out very good. The graphics are full of ugly gradients and bad perspective, the physics isn't as dynamic and exploitable, the level layouts are boring and much more linear... it's inferior in every aspect IMO.<br /><br />Another SNES game that feels somewhat similar to Sonic is <em>Twinbee: Rainbow Bell Adventure</em>. I haven't played this one much, but at first glance it looks more polished than the Speedy Gonzales game.<br /><br />Seeing as I believe that even the NES can pull off a fast-paced engine similar to Sonic (as long as you code it well), of course I believe the SNES can do it too. An original game would be nicer than a direct port, though, not only because of the different resolution, but also because the system has a lot of interesting graphical features that could be used to implement new interesting gimmicks, bosses, and so on.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Even the collision detection on the original Sonic games isn't perfect.<br /></div><br />Definitely not. There's a YouTube series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL01596721403E0594" class="postlink">Sonic 3 and Knuckles Glitches and Oversights</a>, that shows a lot of oddities, many of them related to collisions.<br /><br />Collisions aren't as complicated as people sometimes make them out to be. If you don't plan things well in the beginning, then yeah, you'll end up having to deal with a lot of exceptions and it'll become hell to manage, but if you can define a set of universal rules, reducing exceptions to the minimum, the logic comes out much nicer. I'm mostly talking about slopes here, since collisions with blocks are insanely simple.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Tue Feb 24, 2015 6:41 am</p><hr />

The physics are actually extremely simple, and every enemy is basically box collision + those simple physics + some really dumb AI.

If you come here in the hope to bash the SNES and convert us to Sega, it's a hopeless battle.<br /><br />Also, I hate internet flame wars, but it seems the only purpose of your post is to start one, so I will just point out that you have absolutely no arguments, so I will completely ignore you and hope everyone else will do the same, avoiding yet-another SNES vs Megadrive debate. Also as a reminder you are here on a Nintendo forum so it's not the best place to advocate the Megadrive (not that we have anything against that machine of course).<br /><br />As for code generation for the 6502 family of processor, it seems nobody has yet tried real hard enough to write or target an optimized compiler for the 65xx family of processor. CC65 is based on SmallC which is fundamentally inefficient. LCC is easy to retarget, but do not do many target-independent optimizations. Same problem for SDCC, with the aditional problem it's harder to re-target.<br /><br />I start to have a very clear idea how a back-end for any generated code (not necessary from C) could handle a pseudo-stack without actually using a stack, but this would require a special assembler and linker to handle this functionality to overlay variables in carefully computed fixed locations.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Feb 24, 2015 3:37 am</p><hr />
