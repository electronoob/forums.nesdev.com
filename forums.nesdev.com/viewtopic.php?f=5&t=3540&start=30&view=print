Then the data should be correct, as the EPROM is connected to nothing else. Just double-check the doccumentation of your programmer, because it may add a header or something to have the data larger than usual. Or, I know some EEPROMs have some secret accesable extra data (for manufacturing issues) that are acessible by raising some pin to 12 V in a particular read opperation, maybe your programmer also try to read that data from your normal EPROM and that causes FFs to be added on the begining of the file ? At least I can confirm that the japanese Zelda begins with loads of FFs.

<br />I'll re-read the documentation for the programmer, and see if I can try another programmer..

<br />But you already swore it was just 2 chips, and then changed the story when you had to post a picture. Good luck with this thread. Hey, if you never get this Zelda game to work, you can always be happy that you were the first person to connect a DVD-ROM to an NES, right?!

<br />I was saying EPROMs, not all the IC's in total.  I didn't even know the other one wasn't an EPROM (or EEPROM), I didn't realize it was character RAM...
<br />
<br />I never changed the story..  only time was when I corrected myself for listing the rom specs from the wrong cartridge...

<br />yep, just wanted to see if you guys were on your toes about what PCB is being used...
<br />
<br />the truth:  This thread did start out authentic.  I did find a blank NES cart at the flea market with JAP Zelda on it..  What wasn't true however, was the PCB it used..  the PCB in the real item I bought, was the same PCB as Zelda, but with the Japanese Zelda on it...
<br />
<br />don't worry, im not taking this too far at all..
<br />
<br />but, how hard would it be to reprogram Zelda to work on an SG-ROM board?  when a lot of enemies come on the screen, the game does slow down pretty bad, so the CPU is maxed out as it is, but how much of the RAM gets maxed out?

Specifically, Dragon Warrior 2, 3, and 4 store the town maps there after decompressing them.  (for some reason, Dragon Quest 2 managed to get away with no 8k WRAM)
<br />
<br />Zelda 1 appears to store CODE in the SRAM area.

<br />Well then, anyway, if you want Zelda to run on a SGROM board, you'll have to understand most of the working of the game engine, and then rewrite it so that it does not use SRAM. I guess this means major code optimisations and improvements/changes in the game engine. In the end it wouldn't be worth the effort, as anyone can play the normal Zelda, with only advantages. Exept for the techincal challenge of it, there is no point in doing that. And if you want a good technical challenge, I'd rather recommand try to port FDS only games to the standard NES format.
