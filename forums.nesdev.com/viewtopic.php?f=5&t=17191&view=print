Of course it doesn't match the ground truth perfectly -- there's simply not enough information in the input. Faces similar to the ones in the NN results were probably present in the training set.<br /><br />(BTW, the article is wrong in claiming this makes the TV trope a reality -- these algorithms wouldn't allow you to, say, extract a license plate number from a low resolution image, they would simply dream up some random license plate number if the information in the source image is not sufficient to reproduce it.)<br /><br />That said, temporal stability (= results should appear consistent from frame to frame in videos) is a huge problem with these algorithms, so I'm very skeptical how their &quot;UHD upscaler&quot; actually performs in practice.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'd assume that if any algorithm could do anything close to that, in real time and on arbitrary images, it would have to rely on multiple frames of information.  A jumble of pixels doesn't tell you much, but if you can watch it change over several frames you might be able to figure something out, and your time stability will be better too.  You'd need to be able to detect pans and scene changes somehow, and the results would still be very inconsistent...
