Usually PCs using parallel NOR flash did stick to 5V parts.   Serial ones (FWHUB or SPI) will likely be using 3.3v instead.<br /><br />Of course FWHUB and SPI will be kind of useless for the NES, as they're serial memories...

But in the console with hyundai chips (100ns) works perfect.<br /></div>I mean, both.<br /><br />Basically, the little 8x1 glitches come from the PPU fetch pattern. Every 8x1 chunk of pixels in the background comes from the following sequence by the PPU:<br />* Fetch which tile should be drawn from PPU RAM <br />* Fetch what color that tile should be drawn from PPU RAM<br />* Fetch one bitplane of the tile from CHR<br />* Fetch the other bitplane of the tile from CHR<br /><br />If any one of those steps go wrong, you'll get one of those 8x1 glitches.<br /><br />There's a bunch of ways that adding an unprotected 3V ROM could screw things up.<br /><br />* Because of the PPU's multiplexed data bus, a 3V ROM could drag the data bus too low to be reliably and correctly latched by the 74'373. In turn, that'd cause a fetch from the wrong address and thus the wrong tile.<br /><br />* Because the CHR ROM is only driving its output up to ≈3.3V, the output won't necessarily have risen high enough fast enough to be received by the PPU correctly. And then, bad value → glitch.
