Usually PCs using parallel NOR flash did stick to 5V parts.   Serial ones (FWHUB or SPI) will likely be using 3.3v instead.<br /><br />Of course FWHUB and SPI will be kind of useless for the NES, as they're serial memories...

But in the console with hyundai chips (100ns) works perfect.<br /></div>I mean, both.<br /><br />Basically, the little 8x1 glitches come from the PPU fetch pattern. Every 8x1 chunk of pixels in the background comes from the following sequence by the PPU:<br />* Fetch which tile should be drawn from PPU RAM <br />* Fetch what color that tile should be drawn from PPU RAM<br />* Fetch one bitplane of the tile from CHR<br />* Fetch the other bitplane of the tile from CHR<br /><br />If any one of those steps go wrong, you'll get one of those 8x1 glitches.<br /><br />There's a bunch of ways that adding an unprotected 3V ROM could screw things up.<br /><br />* Because of the PPU's multiplexed data bus, a 3V ROM could drag the data bus too low to be reliably and correctly latched by the 74'373. In turn, that'd cause a fetch from the wrong address and thus the wrong tile.<br /><br />* Because the CHR ROM is only driving its output up to â‰ˆ3.3V, the output won't necessarily have risen high enough fast enough to be received by the PPU correctly. And then, bad value â†’ glitch.
