		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />bsnes will use hiro as its GUI toolkit, just like higan. hiro does not offer any features not explicitly meant for GUI design, so even though it has a Qt compilation target, it cannot be used to save PNG images. The most complicated part of PNG is Deflate, and while nall (general-purpose header library) has a Deflate decoder, it does not have a Deflate encoder. In fact, nall can create Zip archives, but it uses the Store method exclusively when it does so.<br /><br />bsnes v073 previously supported UPS as its only patching format, and it applied UPS patches before trimming headers. For bsnes-classic, I'm planning on doing the same thing with IPS patches but waiting until after trimming headers before applying BPS patches.<br /><br />In case anyone wanted to know what bsnes/higan versions supported which GUI toolkits, here's a chart:<br /><br />hiro (old):<br />  bsnes v028-v041<br /><br />Qt:<br />  bsnes v040-v073<br /><br />phoenix:<br />  bsnes v069-v091<br />  higan v092-v094<br /><br />hiro (new):<br />  higan v095 and up<br />  bsnes v107 and up

It wouldn't improve the situation with, for example, the FEoEZ translation. Likewise, retroactively removing manifest support entirely would just inconvenience actual users by breaking support for numerous existing projects for no particularly great reason.<br /><br />If &quot;BML instead of XML&quot; were just about language/syntax then I would have done it in bsnes-plus a long time ago, but the part that's not immediately implied is the additional reliance on outright gamepak/cartridge folders, a board database, etc. which are all rather conceptually major changes that I simply don't have the time or desire to prioritize at this point (and I have a feeling AWJ doesn't either).<br /><br />(I absolutely don't intend to start any kind of additional discourse/debate about this, but on the off chance that byuu ever decides to support some sort of BML-based manifests for the standalone ROM support in &quot;new bsnes&quot;, I'd happily add support for that as soon as possible.)

It's just not possible to express every variation on SNES PCBs (down to literal bodge wiring on production games) with 100% perfection without it being hopelessly emulator-specific.<br /><br />Manifests are, at best, a way for users to get games working that don't work in higan out of the box. Anything worthwhile will get supported in icarus directly, including Tengai Makyou Zero's fan translation in v107.<br /><br />We don't even have userbase numbers for mainline higan, let alone any forks, so who knows if it's even worth pursuing. Open source lets people do whatever they want. Some people sell my work and don't share money with me, some people complain about my code yet fork it instead of writing their own, some people go against my wishes and do things I'm opposed to, <s>and some, I assume, are good forks</s> (but seriously, some forks are pretty great!) It is what it is, and I knowingly agreed to that when I chose my license. I'm trying not to complain so much about forks I don't like anymore, but I've always acknowledged they have every right to do what they want.<br /><br />If I want people to use my work, I'll just have to give it my all to put out the better release.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">on the off chance that byuu ever decides to support some sort of BML-based manifests for the standalone ROM support in &quot;new bsnes&quot;, I'd happily add support for that as soon as possible.</div><br /><br />As of v107, I've removed the board mapping rules from the manifests, and I'm making a promise not to break the format of manifest.bml again. Yes, seriously. I promised to not change BPS, and I haven't. And I promised not to change bass syntax anymore with v15, and I haven't. I promised MSU1 would remain backward compatible to v1.0, and it has.<br /><br />I'd love it if other projects could utilize my SNES preservation database, because holy <em>god damn</em> I put a lot of time, money and effort into that, and I'm not even halfway finished yet. You don't need manifest files next to ROMs for that, though. You don't need game folders for it either, as I'm demonstrating with bsnes v107.<br /><br />But right now, the only thing I'm literally on my hands and knees <strong>begging</strong> for, is set maintainers to distribute coprocessor firmware with games. I don't care how they end up doing it, I'll support it. You've got your copier headers, your SMC file extensions, your compressed archives, just <em>please</em> ... I need the firmware! It's part of the goddamned game, and it's copyrighted -- I can't ship it!! This is leaving me at a permanent disadvantage to HLE-based emulators, where games just &quot;work&quot; out of the box.

Just as I'm free to write a replacement emulator and do everything in my power to make sure ROM hackers never feel obligated to write hacked-up manifests for the severely outdated XML-based standard ever again.<br /><br />I also want to focus on replicating bsnes-plus's debugging features, eventually. Just like bsnes-classic, bsnes-plus also uses XML manifests, so it too is on my radar.<br /><br />For now, I'm using the tentative name “bsnes-mcfly”, a name that represents traveling into the future. This name won't become final until higan and bsnes v107 are released.
