<br />Unless you're of the mindset that debugging should be done with test-driven development methodology. (Yeah, that was weak.)
<br />
<br />There are plenty of ways to make life harder for pirates:
<br /><ul><li>Put a coprocessor of sorts in the mapper, which handles things like multiplication, crypto, and decompression </li><li>Store most of the game on a big eMMC or microSD soldered onto the cart PCB and copy part of the game to PRG RAM at once, like a big PowerPak or the FDS or like the old CD consoles </li></ul>

<br />And I guess they could, but you could still check for special hardware or something the decoding does, like put something in RAM and also run a checksum routine at times. I'll reply better later and once I think it more through.

<br />Someone said it here already, but there will *always* be at least one person in the world with enough determination, interest, and plain-old hacker curiosity to take whatever you create and spare no expense to figure it out.  Until machines that we create start creating things that we didn't originally intend for them to create [when we hit the Kurzweil'ian "singularity" in a few years!], no human will ever be able to completely outsmart other humans with a machine he/she has created.  Especially when said humans can pretty much <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/09/1024-bit-rsa-encryption-cracked-by-carefully-starving-cpu-of-ele/" class="postlink">do anything</a>.

<br />
<br /><strong>2 tepples</strong> not really, but threads like this showing who is who - "gimmi it now or shut up" with few variations.
<br />
<br /><strong>2 Drag</strong> as for me it is not about copy protection, which is side effect against emulators, but more features, mainly sound extensions.
