<br />Yes, the fact that a controller port has three data input bits. So you can get around 1.5 Mbps. But this is of course just for a bitbucket read. To actually save the data, you'd need at least 7 cycles per bit triplet (LDA $4017 : PHA), so about 770 kbps.

<br />Yes, although I was actually thinking about reading D0 only (rest of the pins aren't connected on my cable). When using the PowerPak it could even buffer the bytes in the FPGA Block RAM (3K I think on PowerPak). I'll probably look in to this later...

<br />I forgot that I can set arbitrary baud rates in D2XX. I set the baud rate to 107265 (the actual rate that the 232R uses isn't exactly this but close enough) and it works on my PAL NES. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Here's a doc about baud rates on FT232R if anybody needs it: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Documents/AppNotes/AN232B-05_BaudRates.pdf">http://www.ftdichip.com/Documents/AppNo ... dRates.pdf</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />EDIT: I'm not sure how I should be handling these "garbage" bytes on the PC side though. My code works like this:
<br />
<br />- writes 0x1234 bytes with FT_Write()
<br />- waits couple of seconds (the amount of bytes received stays same regardless of the delay)
<br />- gets number of bytes in the buffer with FT_GetQueueStatus(): it's always 660
<br />- reads those bytes in with FT_Read()
<br />
<br />The 660 bytes that FT_Read reads are 138 bytes of zero (presumably from asserting CTS?) then comes 510 bytes of alternating 0xFF, 0x00, then checksum+cr+lf, then 2 more bytes of zero.
<br />
<br />My question: what are those 0xFF, 0x00 in there and how should I properly skip the garbage? Is it required to skip all 0x00/0xFF (and escape them when needed) or is there a better way?
<br />
<br />I feel like an idiot asking all these questions. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

<br />
<br />I know for the PICs that do baud-rate autodetection in hardware it requires sending $55 or $AA I think, though.  But all sorts of tricks could do it in software as well.

I'll be getting an FTDI cable soon, and can see whether it behaves the same.<br /><br />It <em>might</em> be that it's interpreting the CTS/Rx assertions as break signals (basically where the line is held in a space state through the stop bit, so that it's not a valid stop bit), which is actually what I intended for them to be in the first place. I've noticed that serial drivers often have a way to insert a particular character in the case of an error. Perhaps yours is set to insert $FF in the case of a break signal, and you could change it to $00. I don't see any mention of this in the documentation, though.<br /><br />You know, the timing of CTS/Rx isn't always a multiple of 10 bit periods, so it might be my code. If this is the case, the junk byte should be limited to $00, $01, $03, $07, $0F, $1F, $3F, $7F, or $FF. So your protocol could simply begin the valid data back to the PC with a byte like $55, something that could never occur due to flow control on the NES side.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I feel like an idiot asking all these questions. :roll:</div>
<br />It's just collaborative problem-solving. It's too bad the code has to be so complex, but the way the PC can send data after the NES has deasserted CTS requires it.
<br />
<br />If you don't need flow control or extreme speed, and can process each byte fairly quickly on the NES, the 57600 code I've been using for years is solid and very easy to follow.

<br />Yeah I don't "need" anything per se currently, just playing around. Hoping to have a development system with PowerPak+FTDI cable that I could use without swapping the CF card all the time. It would also make PowerPak mapper development a lot easier.
<br />
<br />So for now, the 57600 code would do just fine for me. Is it already available somewhere?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yesterday I got PC-&gt;PowerPak transfers working using blargg's 57600 code. So it works like this:
<br />- boot up the PowerPak (all the normal menus are skipped)
<br />- NES waits for transfer
<br />- PC transfers PRG, CHR and FPGA config (mapper)
<br />- game/demo automatically runs when transfer is done
<br />
<br />When power is cycled it waits for a new transfer, although by modifying the mapper this can be done by pressing RESET also.
<br />
<br />TODO:
<br />- transfer game genie codes
<br />- CRC checks
<br />- faster transfer
<br />- check for differences in files and only transfer what has changed
<br />- transfer WRAM PC-&gt;NES
<br />- modify the normal "save WRAM to CF" menu to transfer it back over the cable instead
<br />
<br />EDIT: PRG/CHR size and mirroring settings no longer hardcoded, now the PC app can read iNES files directly

<br />If you have a cable I can release the replacement PowerPak mapper file and the protocol for testing. The software I have only works with FTDI chips, I should probably make it use the the COM ports directly since the FTDI chips can show up as COM ports anyways.
<br />
<br />I also added support for blargg's 115200 bps code. Still no CRC I but wouldn't worry about it too much.
