		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been wondering what kind of programmer would be the best for SNES programming?? Also I need a programmer for NES and Sega Genesis/MD games so it also needs to be compatible with 16 bit EPROMs. I wonder if GQ-4X would be the best choice, what do you all think?? But I don't think this question should be provided over here but I haven't seen any information on the site:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mcumall.com/comersus/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=4312">http://www.mcumall.com/comersus/store/c ... oduct=4312</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mcumall.com/comersus/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=4282">http://www.mcumall.com/comersus/store/c ... oduct=4282</a><!-- m --><br /><br />What's the difference between the full pack and light pack?? As far as I can tell descriptions are.... the same?? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />Overall, do you think this is a good choice?? Are there any better alternatives?? I just got sick of using my crarppy Willem PCB50B programmer, I've always had problems programming 29F016 &amp; 29F032 memories. Most the time while programming the chips, it stopped on some random state, 63%, 71% and didn't progress any further and now it doesn't recognize them AT ALL.... So please for replies with your suggestions, I need to buy anything fast. Thanks in advance!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Any USB microcontroller with enough pins or even a non-USB one with a USB-UART chip like those produced by FTDI will do the job far cheaper than any of those budget programmers.  Wire it up to a socket and the programming itself is trivial.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wish I knew how to code a microcontroller to program a chip, maybe I'll try and learn for this reason. In the mean time I picked up a GQ-3x and have a question for anyone who also has one. Does the Power Led light on yours light up green when just an external dc power supply is connected? Because mine is not and on the standard willem 5 PPA programmer it does. These things have very lackluster documentation and I couldn't find the answer out there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You may have a more enjoyable time with a simpler USB programmer and some 29F080 flash ROMs. They only need 5V to program as well as operate, and everything will be much faster. Forgot a byteswap? No worries, you can fix it in under five minutes. That is a 1-megabyte 8-bit ROM; two in parallel gets you 2 megabytes of 16-bit data. You could do further address decoding to get higher capacities.
