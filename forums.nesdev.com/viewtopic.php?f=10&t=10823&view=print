I just want to shrink my background data by using 2x2 tiles and my setup is like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Ground:<br />&nbsp; .db $32, $33, $42, $43<br />&nbsp;Wall:<br />&nbsp; .db $30, $31, $40, $41<br />&nbsp;Ice:<br />&nbsp; .db $34, $35, $44, $45<br />&nbsp;Black:<br />&nbsp; .db $24, $24, $24, $24<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Cave:<br />&nbsp; .word Ground, Wall, Ice, Black<br /><br />FirstScreen:<br />&nbsp; .db $03,$03,$03,$03, $03,$03,$03,$03, $03,$03,$03,$03, $03,$03,$03,$03<br />&nbsp; .db $03,$03,$03,$03, $03,$03,$03,$03, $03,$03,$03,$03, $03,$03,$03,$03<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$01,$01,$01, $01,$01,$01,$01, $01,$01,$01,$01, $01,$01,$01,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$02, $00,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $02,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$02, $00,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $02,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$02, $00,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $02,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$02, $00,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $02,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$02, $00,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$02, $02,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$00, $00,$00,$00,$01<br />&nbsp; .db $01,$01,$01,$01, $01,$01,$01,$01, $01,$01,$01,$01, $01,$01,$01,$01<br />&nbsp; </div><br /><br />and my decoder where the problem is looks like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;LDX #$00<br />&nbsp;LDA FirstScreen, x<br />&nbsp;TAX<br />&nbsp;LDA Cave, x<br />&nbsp;STA meta_tile_ptr<br />&nbsp;LDA meta_tile_ptr<br />&nbsp;STA $2007</div><br /><br />as you can see there are no loops cos i just want it to show the first tile. and then work from there. now it shows random tiles after every small change i do. whats wrong?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Currently you're copying the low byte of the address, then reading that back and writing it to the screen. So every time you make a small change the addresses shift slightly and you get a different tile on screen.<br /><br />Try this (| lines added/changed):<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;LDX #$00<br />&nbsp;LDA FirstScreen, x<br />|ASL A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; multiply by 2 since address is 2 bytes<br />&nbsp;TAX<br />&nbsp;LDA Cave+0, x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; copy low byte<br />&nbsp;STA meta_tile_ptr+0<br />|LDA Cave+1, x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; copy high byte<br />|STA meta_tile_ptr+1<br />|LDX #0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; indirect modes always use X or Y<br />|LDA (meta_tile_ptr,x) ; load byte from memory at address held in meta_tile_ptr<br />&nbsp;STA $2007<br /></div><br />In this case, you can save significant code/time by skipping the Cave array of addresses and directly calculating for the meta-tiles:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDX #$00<br />LDA FirstScreen, x<br />ASL A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; multiply by 4<br />ASL A<br />TAX<br />LDA Ground, x<br />STA $2007<br /></div><br />This limits you to 64 types. You can use the upper two bits as flags (solid, interactive, etc.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Not sure if you've resolved this yet, but I'll comment anyway.<br /><br />How are you storing your color information? It looks like you're working backwards through the color array. Not saying this is wrong or a bad idea, but the data would need to be in the right order. It's possible that the data you're grabbing and putting into $2007 is $00, and that's why it appears as though nothing has been done. It could grab the wrong values if the index points to somewhere you weren't expecting. <br /><br />It's also possible that the values in $2006 are pointing to somewhere you didn't expect. Make sure you are updating $2006 to point to the correct address every time you write to $2007, or make sure that the PPU increment is set to 1 if you're writing from the top-left to the bottom-right of the screen. Also if you are just allowing it to auto-increment the address for you, make sure you are indeed starting to write attribute data from $23C0/$27C0/$2BC0/$2FC0. If you stopped drawing tiles at $23A0 and left the PPU pointer alone, you'd start writing attribute data as tiles and then the remaining half of the attribute data would go into the top half of the attribute table. Finally, make sure you are writing to $2007 in VBlank or when rendering is turned off.<br /><br />There's a lot of things that could be causing the problem, but the main questions are really: what is the PPU pointer pointing to, and where is it grabbing the value to put in $2007.
