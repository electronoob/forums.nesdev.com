I figured the extra ram would be an option or soldered in by the user if they wanted more than 32kb to play around with.  The cable is really more of the barrier here, although i do have a good supply of nes cables.<br /><br />It is neat to think about the cart supporting development of contest entrees released on future revisions, but admittedly not very likely...

It would also be nice to move the text box downwards (by uploading it to the currently visible nametable area, instead of using sprite 0 hit for adjusting scroll after it), but that's a lot more work so I don't know if I'll do it. Also I'm adding buffering for button events, so screen control during screen transitions should feel a little bit better (in v01 controller is not read when a new screen is being loaded, so it can miss a release-and-press sequence).<br /><br />I don't want to release new versions haphazardly to avoid having a million+1 different versions floating around.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for being slow to chime in.  Things are looking pretty solid with the ROM tepples.  I didn't notice anything wrong running on my boards with this most recent build.  One note: I'm guessing you're aware, but the image for Tapedump matches Russian Roulette.  Starting to think that is more of the generic image than something that belongs to Russian Roulette <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />.<br /><br />thefox, any word on when you're expecting the next/final release?  Am I correct in saying this is the final item to check off saying the ROM is final/complete?  No rush, just trying to see what you're thinking/planning.  Even as is it's still pretty complete IMO.<br /><br />Some updates on my end:  Jim's Cool has gotten back on the saddle debugging his CIC now that I got some parts in his hands showing the issues I found.  He's had some success in the last couple days, 'broke' parts now work but aren't as stable as they should be.  Issues like it not appreciating (rapid) power cycling and such.  Sounds like he'll have something ready for us on this front fairly soon.  The other thing is I don't need to have the CIC solution in hand before starting assembly of the PCBs.  Really I could start right now with soldering all the surface mount components since those aren't going to change at this point.<br /><br />I went ahead and ordered all the parts to whip up 50 of these last week.  I've got everything in hand, but the EPROMs, they should be here this week.<br /><br />The other items needed are cases and labels.  If someone's interested in drawing up a label that'd be great.  I think I know someone who can print the labels for me.  We'll be getting the cases from retrozone.<br /><br />Any other boxes we still need to check to wrap this thing up?  I think the original goal was to announce the full details of release and things be in production by the end of the year.  Looks like we're not too far off from that goal, just got to make sure we keep the ball rolling.

Def not a need though, just a thought.  Or a revolver for russian roulette?<br /><br />Well looks like we're in good shape then.  Jim's cool seems to have fixed the bug in his CIC.  He's cleaning some things up and testing the SNES portion before releasing anything.  But this is no longer a stopping block for release <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So not much else left holding us back now.  With the other projects I have going on, I should be able to start production before the end of January.  With that, how does a FINAL rom and art work due date of Jan 30th sound? Assuming we have some sort of art and I can get cases and labels in hand early Feburary I should be able to start shipping carts by the end of Feburary.<br /><br />Something else, that's yet to be determined.  What do we want to charge?  Here is the projected earnings I had way back that still look proper:<br />Assuming we sold all 50, after covering expenses prizes we'd have:<br />@$20 ~$175 earned<br />@$30 ~$675 earned<br />@$40 ~$1175 earned<br />+ cost of shipping ~$5.50 for priority mail in the US.<br /><br />My thought is $30, which is on par for other produced homebrews.  And it'd cover a little more than needed for prizes of the next compo.<br /><br />Does anyone have any input on how to handle the release and sales?  Do we want to pre-sell so that anxious people can assure they'll get some of the first batch?  Or do we want to have a free-for-all frenzy on an announced date?  The presale would be helpful for the pocket book and helping to determine total need but is not required by any means.  If we did do a pre-sale I would want to wait for it to start until I had everything in hand and have made up atleast the first couple carts.  That way people can see exactly what they're buying and there's no doubt about whether they will actually materialize.<br /><br />Where/how do we want to sell them?  I can sell them on my site if people please perhaps a 'hidden' page linked to from here to start?  If someone else wants to handle the sales and everything that's more than okay with me.  I just need cash in hand for my expenses before I ship anything out the door.  I could also ship directly to buyers or ship a box full to whoever is handling customer sales if it's not me.<br /><br />Any other thoughts or items I've missed?<br /><br />Oh yeah, have we decided on an official title???  Do we want to just call it &quot;Action 20 <em>featuring Streemerz</em>&quot;  I know a few people I could ask to try their hand at artwork for the label.  But it would be nice to be able to provide a title and some input on what we'd like to see on the label.  My thoughts are something that's a spin off of the action 52 label featuring some of the top games.  Making sure to have something about the compo and nesdev/NA on there.<br /><br /><img src="http://bootgod.dyndns.org:7777/imagegen.php?ImageID=12486&amp;width=600" alt="Image" />
