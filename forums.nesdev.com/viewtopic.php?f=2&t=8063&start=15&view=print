		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I probably should post a new reply since I've gone back and edited my previous reply about a dozen times now to add corrections and new findings.
<br />
<br />Anyway, because of my epiphany, I now know this part of the wiki article to be flat-out wrong:
<br />
<br /><em>But as a slight optimization, you can scale first (256 * 8/7 = 292) and then pad: stretch the 256x240 pixels to 292x240, 584x480, 876x720, or 1168x960 square pixels or 320x240 or 640x480 non-square pixels. Then you can emulate the overscan by drawing a TV bezel on top of the edges of the emulated picture. </em>
<br />
<br />It's wrong because it fails to figure in the <strong>VISIBLE</strong> aspect ratio of the NES screen on 4:3 TVs. The visible aspect should be based on 256x224, NOT 256x240. As I said in my updated reply on page 1, this is the same mistake the designers of Wheel of Fortune made. The article then makes it even worse by suggesting a bezel to cover up the top and bottom edges. Too bad it already used that area to factor in VISIBLE aspect ratio! Wrong wrong wrong! You calculate the ratio based on 256x224, and then add on the remaining 16 lines to the top and bottom. Only after that should you consider the option of a bezel.

<br />
<br />Also, CRT TVs tend to distort the image based on the contents of the palette.  Ever beaten a level in Arcade Pac Man?  Notice how the entire maze moves as the colors change.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Argh! Just when I thought I had it all figured out, it blows up in my face again!
<br />
<br />Here's Wheel of Fortune taking into account my idea of using the "visible" aspect ratio based on 256x224:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.firebrandx.com/downloads/neswheel.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Notice the perfect circle? So it would seem they had the same idea I did. You simply go with a 4:3 format based on the middle 224 lines. Unfortunately this goes even more extreme than less extreme. In this case, it comes out to about 299 or 298x240. That's even worse than 292x240!
<br />
<br />If I'm going to go with "visible" aspect ratio, I'd need to know on average just how much of the 256 is normally displayed on screen. We already know the vertical average is 224, but so far we've been assuming all 256 for horizontal. 
<br />
<br />I'm about ready to give up on this quest to find the truth. It's so frustrating!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Update:
<br />
<br />I got so fed up, I dug out my CRT monitor from the garage, hooked the NES up to it and did the same physical measure of the graphics as I did on my LCD TV. Much to my dismay, the measurements of the onscreen graphics exactly matched the ratio of 292x240. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> 
<br />
<br />Furthermore, the Wheel of Fortune test I did was wrong. The border wasn't meant to be a perfect circle, but rather the wheel itself was. At 292x240, it works out just fine.   
<br />
<br />So I give up. My own CRT matched the 292x240 ratio, so I cannot deny that now. My apologies for my previous revelations. I seriously thought I was on to something with the visible aspect concept.

<br />
<br /> The visible scanline count has nothing to do with it. Screen aspect ration and PAR (pixel aspect ratio) are not the same thing. First, you calibrate your TV to 4:3. If the visible part of the display window doesn't allow for full 4:3 image, then you need to resort to adjustment with clipping (overscan). When that's correct, <em>then</em> you can analyze PARs of games on the TV.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've used this thread as a guide before, and came back to it now when calibrating emulators. It seems that FCEUX is the only one I have that will let me input the correct aspect ratio adjustment.<br /><br />Others either keep everything 1:1, or they have an automatic adjustment that goes 1.25:1 (which is much too wide; at 3x it becomes 3.75:3). Even FCEUX has these as defaults and forces one to manually put in a different number in order to get anything resembling television proportions.<br /><br />I have no idea why this is. At 3x, I input 3.422 in the &quot;x&quot; field. 3.422 is most accurate in stretching 256 pixels into 292, but a true 8x7 multiplier would be 3.428, which becomes one pixel too wide due to rounding.<br /><br />The way the pixels scale, inputting 3.425 yields the same result as 3.422, and might be easier to remember. What's also noteworthy is that, in this range, no columns appear to flicker with no hardware acceleration or filters, whereas in other ranges they do.<br /><br />The thing that bugs me is that other emulators do not seem to have the option to even get the aspect ratio this precise. They're either way too narrow or way too wide. The supposed &quot;TV aspect ratio correction&quot; is flat-out wrong.<br /><br />Why not have an accurate value for TV ratio compensation in these emulators already? It seems a shame someone would have to Google to find an old thread where they could find that the answer is an input value that would equal (292/256) times the vertical scale factor. Why not just program these values in there in the first place? Instead of 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, and 5, which are clearly inaccurate, we'd have this:<br /><br />1.141, 2.281, 3.422, and 4.563. These values make the screen look the way it did on a television set, and with the proportions the game designers most likely intended.<br /><br />This is a really strong reason for me to prefer FCEUX over the others. Even though it's defaults are incorrect, at least we're able to correct it. And it helps that its default color palette is more accurate than the others' as well and that we get hq3x as an option (even though, sure, other emulators still have little things over FCEUX, like that weird bug in Mega Man 3, but they're relatively minor).<br /><br />So ... I just figured I'd make this post so that anyone else coming along can get an idea what values *should* be used to get a TV aspect ratio, and maybe so some developers can consider making them more correct in the first place. It is a little frustrating to have so many NES emulation options, but all of them falling short on such a basic thing.
