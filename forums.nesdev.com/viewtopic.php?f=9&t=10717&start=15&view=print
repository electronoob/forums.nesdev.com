Leaving a TV plugged into the NES's video out is a good indicator: it'll still display things even if you are undervolting the NES itself. But the RF output won't work without the unregulated +13V line (it's the only thing that won't).<br /><br />After that... you never answered where you're injecting power into the NES. How are you connecting the benchtop supply's 5V line? You've already implied it's not going through the 7805 (good, that wouldn't work). Where were you measuring 4.25V?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So right now you've got a stable solid color on that screen, but no games run? Are you sure that power is getting to the cartridge? (What game are you testing with?) Do you have a simple logic tester or frequency counter or anything else that will tell you if a line is alternating? If so, are the various CPU address and data lines changing? ( <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CPU_pin_out_and_signal_description" class="postlink">CPU pinout</a> )<br /><br />How certain are you that the 5V from the bench supply is accurate? If you measure Vcc around the NES's board, is it 4.25V everywhere, or does it vary? Are there any places where it's noticeably different?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The bench power supply measures 5v off of the Nintendo so I know that is good. The 4.25 is constant. I checked several pins plus the chips, plus the 5v in on the cartridge so I know power is being delivered. I have not yet checked the pcb on the cartridge yet to see if there is current there.<br /><br />I will check the CPU pins. I do have an oscilloscope 100mhz tektronics that I can check the data lines with. I will do that and let you know what I find.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I assume the M2 pin still oscillating. (If not, is the 21MHz input still oscillating? It certainly should be if the PPU is still drawing a picture. If 21MHz is still oscillating, and M2 isn't, the CPU has broken).<br /><br />Do any of them start oscillating again when you hit the reset button? If so, the CPU has crashed. The most likely way this has happened is that at some point it fetched one of the 12 instructions that look like 0x?2, almost all of which cause a total crash. This is almost certainly due to the cartridge not being plugged in correctly.<br /><br /><br />Going back to the voltage question: you say you inject 5V where it originally came from the RF modulator daughterboard? Which is the middle pin of the five huge pins? Or are you injecting 5V on the daughterboard at the last (rightmost) pin of where the 7805 was? (Are you using a front- or top- loading NES? If the former, the orange wire to the reset button and power LED is immediately connected to the RF modulator's trace: is it 5V there?)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The address and data lines should toggle briefly after you hit the reset button. Do they? If so, I agree that the cartridge, or connection to it, is almost certainly the problem. What game are you testing with? I know I tested SMB3 running ok on 4V.<br /><br />If they don't, does the CPU's /RESET input toggle when you hit the reset button?<br /><br />If those lines toggle briefly after you hit the reset button, but not on initial power up, your voltage lines take too long to stabilize. Try replacing the capacitor C8 (0.1ÂµF, next to the CIC) with something larger, which will lengthen the power-on-reset pulse.

They had to rely on story and not graphics like most modern gaming.
