Despite ~110 downloads of beta 1 so far, I'm pretty much on my own with all the testing. And my testing is thorough! So, just a few more days until the release of beta 2, I guess. It will happen before December, that's for sure! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever be able to provide pre-programmed chips. Maybe you should consider sending your PowerPak bunnyboy's way asking him to re-flash it for you?

If all works out as planned folks, upgrading your v1.0X PowerPaks in the future might be as easy as copying some files to your card, waiting for the automatic flasher to complete, and play. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I'll keep you posted! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, guys. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'm happy to announce that the automatic v1.0X updater for PowerPaks with the AT29C010A chip is practically finished. I successfully completed and tested the code this evening, first using v1.02 and then v1.03b1 (which my unofficial release is based upon) as a base. Takes hardly three seconds to update, and what's best is that my implementation is as user-friendly as possibly imaginable. Just load the new mapper folder onto your card, expect yourself prompted to update, and presto: The SNES reboots running the new firmware. No need even to reload another set of CF mappers! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />What's now left to do is to write an alternative programming routine suitable for the SST39SF010 chip, which most revE PowerPaks seem to have installed. Since I don't have this chip available to test, it doesn't make much sense to start on this yet. (The AT29C010 is programmed on a 128-byte sector basis, while a quick glance at the SST39SF010's datasheet reveals that it is programmed on a byte-by-byte basis.) What I also feel compelled to do is support &quot;early adopters&quot; (i.e., beta1 and beta2 users) by further enhancing the new update module (SU.MAP).<br /><br />Another thing worth mentioning is that I've currently no knowledge whatsoever about what kind of flash chip(s) PowerPaks newer (?) than revE ship(ped) with. To even hope for eventually supporting those, I can only rely on people willing to share PCB photos of their carts. (Is there anyone out there at all who possesses a PowerPak with a non-AT29C010, non-SST39SF010, and/or non-socketed boot ROM?)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Is it possible to arrange the firmware update so that there's a recovery method if the system happens to lose power during flashing, such as automatically loading autoexec.sfc if A+B+Select+Start is held at power on? Compare what FlashMe on DS does.</div><br />Definitely not, due to the way the PowerPak hardware is designed. Very different from a Nintendo DS. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> But whoever requires an all-or-nothing flash gaming solution (like myself) is heartily invited and encouraged to buy an <a href="http://sd2snes.de/blog/" class="postlink">sd2snes</a>. Those are <strong><em>really</em></strong> great! I use mine for casual gaming, and MSU1-related projects. Like! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
