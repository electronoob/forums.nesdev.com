For those of you thinking <em>&quot;the 32-what-now?&quot;</em>, the 32X was an add-on for the Megadrive/Genesis containing dual Super-H2 CPUs clocked at ~23 Mhz (same setup as the Saturn, but clocked slightly lower), some WRAM, some VRAM for a linear framebuffer and a PWM audio circuit. I do all the NSF-related stuff on one CPU and handle the UI on the other CPU.<br /><br /><img src="http://jiggawatt.org/badc0de/NSF32X.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Download <a href="http://jiggawatt.org/badc0de/mic-nsf32x-2.zip" class="postlink">the ROM</a>. Works best on an actual 32X, but it also runs fairly well in Kega Fusion.<br /><a href="http://jiggawatt.org/badc0de/mic-nsf32x-2-src.zip" class="postlink">The source code</a> is also available for those who are interested.<br />And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWoxigSt9kI" class="postlink">here's a video capture</a> from my PAL setup (Megadrive model 2 + 32X).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's also a Wolf3D port for the plain old Genesis.<br /><br />From a gamer's perspective the 32X is little else than an expensive paper weight. The few games that were made for it were mostly rubbish. But for someone who likes to develop for old video game consoles it's a pretty nice system, reminiscent of late 80s or early 90s PCs. It's also fairly easy to develop for, depending of course on how far you're trying to stretch things (theoretically you could have code running on 4 CPUs in parallel, and graphics made up of the 32X's framebuffer + the Genesis' tile layers and sprites)

I've never really thought about the image quality. It's not something old game consoles are known for anyway. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrQ--wBqXzc#t=37" class="postlink">Here's a video</a> of when both the 32X framebuffer and the Megadrive VDP is used (the box with the scrolling text is drawn on the Megadrive side, and the rest comes from the 32X).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I've been trying to buy a 32X for my video game collection for years, but the minuscule amount of good games can never seem to justify the prices people ask for it.</div><br />They're also pretty unreliable. I've got three 32Xs; two broken ones, and one that works. But I don't collect them so I didn't care about getting the boxes or manuals, which lowered the price considerably.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've never seen the 32X in RGB, but in Composite the mixing of 32X and Genesis graphics doesn't result in any noticeable loss of quality. I really don't see why there would be any loss. I've always thought the 32X was an interesting and under utilized piece of hardware. I don't think it really had a chance in the marketplace but it's interesting to see what you could do with it. <br /><br />There was a point in time where for gamers the 32X was worth it because the 32X cost maybe $20 at most and most games weren't much more than that. There aren't alot of titles but enough for that low cost of entry to have been worth it at the time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The 32X takes in the Genesis' analogue RGB and overlays its own RGB &amp; encodes it.  The resulting output is still pretty clean as far as RGB goes, and since the video encoder in the 32X is superior to the Genesis', the combined video will look superior in composite as well.

The Genesis' sound chip is not used at all, if that was what you were thinking of (i.e. trying to recreate the NES sound with an FM chip).
