		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had inserted a bug in my code right around that time which was causing troubles when flashing nes boards.  That set me back a bit as I didn't have as good of version control as I should and lost the working source.  I've been waiting on fixing that before releasing a new version, good news is I finally found the problem last night and corrected it.  So I'm officially moving forward again.<br /><br />Here's roughly my current task list on my firmware in order of priority.<br /><ul><li> Add support for flashing discrete mapper boards. (In-progress, small amount of time needed ~week?)</li><li> Make flashing SNES boards 'smarter' to handle things like interleaved roms, 6MB roms, and auto-doubling (faked mirroring) to make large boards look smaller. (Not started, medium amount of time needed to accomplish ~month?).</li><li> Allow software/firmware to accept .nes and .smc files.  Gets a little complicated with all the variants of everything, but the idea is to make it almost as easy as loading a file into an emu. (Not started, large amount of development time in relation to others.)</li><li> The inverse of the above, aka auto-dump carts by sensing the hardware and building the dumped rom. (Not started, about same time as previous.)</li></ul><br />I would say these things are reasonable to do within a couple months.  I do have NES mapper sensing operational by use of mirroring.  Sensing variants and rom size will be a separate effort.  I probably got ahead of myself a little shooting for Sept based on the higher priority items like smarter NES/SNES flashing coming first.  The other consideration is that I'll be devoting more of my development time to the nesdev compo for the next ~3months...  Can't make any promises on the above, just inform you of where I'm at with things.

Do you update the original Kazzo firmware in your file bundle when it's released (is it even updated anymore)?<br />2. It may be worth adding a date/firmware version to the site so people can quickly check if they're up to date.

I've been using the 2013-8-19 firmware, do I need to do a fresh install of the whole 2013-12-22 Kazzo.zip, or can I just replace the firmware folder with the newer build? Comparing the two zip packages, only found a difference with the firmware folders, did I miss something else?<br /> ATM, the 2013-8-19 is working fine for me with the two boards (SXROM) I have, are there new features or is this a maintenance build?<br />Thanks for your very cool project!!<br />Yogi <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Good to hear 'bout added support for Mapper 0, will be interested in your V3 boards when available. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Yogi

Just registered to ask some questions about this <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />I received a Kazzo board from INL a few weeks back and am trying to dump some games with it. However, I keep getting &quot;reader open error&quot; when I try to dump a game in the anago GUI. I am running Windows 8. The first thing I did was install the driver following the guide on NeoGAF, and when that didn't seem to work when it came time to dump a cart, I also tried using the Hardware Wizard to install the driver from the INL_Retro-Prog.inf file. They indicate that it was installed properly. <br /><br />When I run &quot;kazzo_test&quot; that's included with the software I receive the notification &quot;Could not find USB device &quot;kazzo&quot; with vid=0x16c0 pid=0x5dc.&quot;<br /><br />Any suggestions?
