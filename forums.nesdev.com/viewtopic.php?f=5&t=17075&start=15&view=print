That being said I'm glad they did, just sad they seem to make some other SPC players not react properly.<br /><br />I did an FF7 SPC that was supposed to disable echo writes essentially cutting the reverb so that there was nothing left but silence. Spcplay and that other Japanese SPC player handles it right, but DDB and zxtune on Android kind of blow up when it happens and causes a feedback to occur so I had to throw in an extra command to mute the echo so you can't hear when it does that.<br /><br />Here's that SPC if you want to throw it against your player too, hopefully it doesn't make it explode either XD<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/Remakes/FF7Stuff/ff7pizza.spc">http://tssf.gamemusic.ca/Remakes/FF7Stuff/ff7pizza.spc</a><!-- m --><br /><br />This is why my name is in the credits for WinAmp, Jake Stine used to use my mods for testing since I used to do crazy shit to break his MikMod player haha

I just wanted to make a minor correction real quick 'cuz this stuff tends to proliferate:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Perhaps the most surprising thing to me though, is that he said it only took 22KB, because the instruments were very small.</div><br /><br />After messing with the track again, I saw that I had misremembered what the console said, and actually have 22KB -remaining-. So the track is roughly double what I thought it was, ~42-some KB.<br /><br />The biggest reason I wanted to do this was because people seem to have this idea that the SNES is locked into mock-orchestra sounds, and that the SNES can't sound crisp because of interpolation, and that the SNES can't do this-and-that etc...<br />Attached a few conversions of various Amiga/PC game music that I made using snesmod, I was thinking of using these for a video explaining what exactly the limits are for SNES audio, why songs tend to sound muffled, what sort of sounds you can do, that sort of thing. Maybe someday I'll be able to find the time...<br /><br />Anyway, I've done some NES homebrew soundtracks, and I'd love to do SNES homebrew soundtracks too if anyone's looking for a musician...!

(why???)<br />* Is the memory address 0xFD, 0xFE, or 0xFF?<br />* Is the memory address 0xF0-0xFC?<br />* Is it neither of the last two? (because it's actually 0x10000 or above)<br /><br />I think whatever compiler he tested against treated the enums as signed, because the math there ( (r_t0out + 0xF0 - 0x10000) seems to work correctly if that expression is treated as a signed number. Apparently the signed-ness of an enum is officially undefined, so ... naughty naughty? Makes you wonder on which compilers the original CVE wouldn't happen because this expression was treated as signed.<br /><br />I'm just bewildered by an ISA implementation where bitmasks are expensive and subtraction+comparison+branching is cheap.
