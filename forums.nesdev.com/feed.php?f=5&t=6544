It depends on whether the exact model mentioned in the video description (the Pentagon 512K) had a turbo mode (7 MHz) or not, and whether it was used when recording that video. Those east european Spectrum clones also had enhancements in the video department IIRC, though I'm not familiar with the details.<br /><br />Sounds like it'd largely be a rewrite in any case, considering the differences in the audio/video subsystems as well in the CPUs, and the vast differences in available RAM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1181">mic_</a> — Fri Jul 02, 2010 11:44 am</p><hr />
