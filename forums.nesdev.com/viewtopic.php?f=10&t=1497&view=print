Really, I just need the ability to get to a routine variably (I'm not a very good explainer). But when the needed routines address is stored in temp memory.

<br />
<br />These are RAM values right? When you create labels to point to these locations make sure the labels represent even numbers.

<br />Yesterday was a long day. I don't know why I kept writing Absolute. I meant Absolute <span style="text-decoration: underline">Indirect</span>. 
<br />
<br />Wait a minute. Its not the address to jump to that messes it up. Its the pointer's address in RAM. Doh!
<br />
<br />Example : 
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda #$34 <br />sta $2FF <br />lda #$12 <br />sta $300 <br />JMP &#40;$2FF&#41; ; JMP &quot;Not really where it would jump to&quot;<br /></div>

<br />Right?

<br />
<br />The reason people encounter problems with this instruction is that JMP ADDR is often incorrectly defined to fetch the address from ADDR and ADDR+1, when it really fetches it from ADDR and ((ADDR + 1) AND $FF) OR (ADDR AND $FF00), that is, only incrementing the lower 8 bits without any carry. Correct the documentation and the claimed bug in the processor goes away.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Usually, you'll want to store the adress to jump in a two-var pointer. And if you keep all yours two vars pointers in zero-page, you will be sure that the high byte of jmp ($xxxx) is always $00, so it won't cross RAM page boundaries.
<br />If you want to do this out of page zero, you have one change out of 256 that this bug happens to you. That is fairly low, but to keep sure, I think .align 2 will do the work.
<br />Doing this out of ram is just stupid, since as long as you can read an adress in ROM you can use jmp absolute. The only exeption to this is if you want a kind of software interupt, where you'd use jmp ($fffa) for a software NMI or jmp (£fffc) for a software reset. Since the adresses are fix, you won't meet that bug. You could also use jmp NMI and jmp Reset in absolute.
