I was a bit disappointed upon seeing this, but thought I'd double check.   It's not possible to get Component out using this encoder is it?<br /><br />If anything I got the superior video on this snes so RGB -&gt; Component may not be such a bad alternative.  I just don't have a scart to component converter yet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks everyone for the ideas here...I tried the amp with the 2n3904 transistor and it was a bad idea as the picture at the top of the screen would heavily distort.  <br /><br />I got so frustrated and went straight back to the basics of what kyuusaku had mentioned right at the start of this post.  So lets do this one right...and I am mostly looking for peoples opinions, especially kyuusaku's, about my circuit that I have posted.  I think I have covered most of the angles but I feel like I am missing something.  I could possibly throwing in some POTS instead of resistors for tweaking of the color, and a variable cap on the output.  Once I have enough opinions I will order some parts and start testing this baby out.<br /><br />Once this is finished I would like to mass produce professional circuit boards as the ease of cost comes in mass production (10 minimum for the best price break)!  This means I would be more than willing to pass on my extras to whom ever is wanting a copy of the board.  Lastly, I do not plan to sell this design or make money off it as I strongly believe it should be completely open source.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My parts from Digikey have arrived!  I have built the circuit designed above and something just wasn't right.  I realized then that I forgot the DC decoupling capacitors on the input resulting in the video only showing Black and White.  The black and white was prevalent because I was saturating the Pr and Pb video so much that it was clipping off all the signal on the output...I did this once before in a OpAmp lab back in the day.  <br /><br />Now, one thing I am not quite sure about and probably because my lack of knowledge with video signals...I am using 0.1uF plastic cap for the &quot;input capacitors&quot; and the images are sharp but solid Red Blue and Greens &quot;runs&quot; (runs, similar to when you put a red sock in white laundry) horizontally across where the image is present.  When I increase the capacitance to 10uF tantalum the colour &quot;runs&quot; start to fade away but the video is now less vibrant...however the vibrancy loss is minimal.  Too much capacitance, 220uF, and the vibrancy is lost, I am sure this has to do with good old AC theory...as capacitance increases so does resistance in high frequencies.  I am sure there is some &quot;magical input voltage level&quot; that I am looking for...however I do not know what it is and 10uF seems to be the ticket.  I did see people mention that 1.6Vrms was a favourite number.  <br /><br />What I really need is a capacitor set!  I will buy some more capacitors with different values and shoot for this voltage level.  I have also seen people sticking in a 1M ohm resistor in parallel after the capacitor.  The good thing about that is it is a high pass filter and you can adjust a resistor easier than a capacitor, bad thing is your creating a filter and potentially degrading/distorting the video where the cut-off frequency is if you design it wrong.<br /><br />More to come...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the amplifiers work fine...I used 4.7uf on the input and no problem.<br /><br />My biggest issue now is the Y component, Luma.  Its distorted, I am at a loss for what I should do now as the exact same thing is happening with the transistor amp that I tried earlier in this forum.  It appears very clear in the middle but as the screen gets closer to the top or bottom the whites and blacks seem to get very jagged on objects.  I have nailed it down to my receiver at this moment and not the circuit.  It has something to do when it sends it out via HDMI to the projector since straight into the projector...works flawlessly.  This is kind of lame as then it defeats the purpose of having HDMI and now I have to run a component cable to my projector.  Oh well...the Retron 5 will be coming out later this year and it has HDMI out...so it may possibly be exactly what we all have been waiting for.<br /><br />Ok, I will update my circuit and post it to the forum when I am finished.

(Should fix the white washed image)<br /><br />But as far as Red and Blue go I'm lost to what to do. There are so many differing ideas in this thread I'm lost.<br />I'm hoping that putting either a 10uF or 220uF cap plus a resistor on the Red and Blue lines will work.<br /><br />Please anyone help? Other than my image being whitewashed(Which I know how to fix now) and shaking... I liked what I seen.<br /><br />Is there any way to kill the image shaking?

Some TVs, like my VX32L, support 240p S-Video and 480i YPbPr but not 240p YPbPr. I'd recommend just using a GameCube S-Video cable; at 5.4 MHz dot clock, there isn't much of a difference between S-Video and either flavor of component.
