It's not hard.<br /><br />Assuming you're using Windows: you then combine the two files -- the header and the assembled code (usually resulting in a .bin or .o file) by using <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">copy /b header.bin+code.bin game.nes</tt>.

It's that easy.</div><br />It's easy, but pretty Jurassic if you ask me, something you'd do in the old days of DOS when we only had primitive tools. I'd much rather keep the header inside the source file, like in the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=58138#p58138" class="postlink">ASM6 templates</a> I posted a while ago or how Dwedit just posted. I'm actually doing something a bit more sophisticated than that nowadays: a macro does all the bit masking and shifting to generate the header based on more readable parameters.

Should it not be?<br /></div><br />The correct answer is: it depends.<br /><br />The source code you're using might actually try to build the .nes header itself at the top using .db statements or otherwise.  Since you haven't provided any code, I cannot tell you.<br /><br />Otherwise some kind of batch file or script that is causing the asm6 output file to be named something.nes, which is incorrect.  asm6 does not generate .nes files (meaning it generates code/binaries, but no NES header).  **OR** the script may be doing the method I described above; you will need to provide the full contents of that script.  asm6 will generate raw code, which is colloquially referred to as a .bin file.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'm a little confused. Should the actual source code (Before being combined with the header) be saved as an .nes file,  or .bin?</div><br />The source code has no relevancy; source code is source code.  What you care about is the assembled source code, which should be going to a .bin file (unless the NES header portion is being stuck into the source itself -- again, I do not know, because you haven't provided any source code).<br /><br />Normally you take the .bin file and prepend a 16-byte NES header on the front of it, and the resulting file should have a .nes extension.<br /><br />So let's recap:<br /><br />filename.asm = the source code to your program/game<br />filename.bin = the assembled results (binary/code) of filename.asm, after assembled with asm6<br />header.bin = the 16-byte NES header that you get to make yourself with a hex editor or by other means<br />filename.nes = the result of <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">copy /b header.bin+filename.bin filename.nes</tt>, which you load with an emulator<br /><br />Now as I said, if some source code you're using has the actual 16-byte NES header written into the source code itself (it would usually be at the top), then there will be no header.bin involved, and you can just use asm6 to output into a .nes file directly.  But again: without seeing the source, I cannot tell you if this is the case or not.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I only asked that because I thought the errors I was getting were because of how my code was being assembled.</div><br />Errors you get during assembly <strong>have nothing to do with emulators</strong>.

All I really know how to do is load numbers into registers, and then store them into memory.<br /><br />That, and a few other things.<br /><br />I don't have any real project in mind yet, so I don't have any source code for it.<br /><br />Anyway, Tokumaru told me to write a batch file that assembles an .asm file into an .nes file. That's what I've been doing, and that may be why I'm having trouble trying to run anything in an emulator.<br /><br />I'll try out the headers Tokumaru and Dwedit provided when I get the chance. Then I'll take your advice on combining the two .bins into an .nes file. (I'm assuming you do this with a batch file. If not, please let me know.)<br /><br />Thank you all for your help.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, so then can you show the batch file?  I get the impression you're maybe a little reluctant to show what you have in fear of backlash or scrutiny from the community -- don't be!<br /><br />To make this simple, you're either going to need to:<br /><br />1. Make a separate file (example: header.bin) that contains the 16-byte NES header, and then prepend that onto the results of your assembled source code, with the resulting file being named with a .nes extension (i.e. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">asm6 filename.asm filename.bin</tt>, then <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">copy /b header.bin+filename.bin filename.nes</tt> -- all of this can be done within the batch file itself) -- or...<br /><br />2. Define the 16-byte NES header within your assembly file yourself (at the very top), i.e. what Dwedit posted earlier.  You can then use asm6 to assemble your code directly into a .nes file (e.g. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">asm6 filename.asm filename.nes</tt>).  Just understand that all the pseudo-op directives are doing are defining raw bytes (that make up the NES header) at the start of the resulting file, followed by your code (which is what gets run by the emulator/console).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I took about 15 minutes today to write this for you.  It should get you started using mapper #0.  No graphics or anything else are added here (you're going to need some); this is just purely to get you set up/going, and is commented decently for starters (I put Wiki references within the comments).<br /><br />Assembling this is simple -- <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">asm6 code.asm code.nes</tt> -- which will result in a file called <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">code.nes</tt> being made.<br /><br />Do not expect to &quot;see&quot; anything on-screen if loaded into an emulator -- there are no graphics added (no CHR data), there is no code to set up the nametables or attribute tables, nor turning on the screen, setting up mirroring, etc..  If you want something that does all that... well, just see the comments in the file.  I can give you something simple if you want to see that.<br /><br />I would recommend using an emulator with a debugger for learning things, by the way.  Good choices are a recent version of FCEUX or Nintendulator.  If you want to see this code run each instruction, run FCEUX, enter the debugger, and add a breakpoint for read/write/execute at address 8000, then load <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">code.nes</tt>.  You'll see the CPU stop immediately at $8000 (which is where your code starts -- it's where the reset vector points to) and you can then step through each instruction's execution using Step Into and see the CPU do its thing.  It's not exciting visually because, as I said, no &quot;graphically-related&quot; stuff is being done here so all you'll see in FCEUX is a grey screen, but you'll see in the debugger the code that correlates with <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">code.asm</tt>.
