Doesn't a PC have different memory mapping from that of the GB? By emulating the CPU you can always check which addresses are accessed and reroute them as necessary. RAM size can be handled with extra RAM on the cart, which is supported by current ROM formats.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />NES just have not enough RAM to emulate 8+8 KB of GameBoy's RAM and VRAM.<br /></div><br />The NES can have more than 8KB of VRAM if you use CHR-RAM, but you'd probably need even more space to double-buffer everything, since the mulator won't be fast enough to perform all updates necessary from one frame to the next. It's doable, it's just slow.<br /><br />What I'm really not sure is whether using the PPU features directly would work reasonably well for a decent number of games, because there are 3 very significant incompatibilities:<br />1. There's no way to mask the sides of the background, so you're going to see garbage tiles;<br />2. The NES can only display 8 sprites per scanline, while the GB can do 10, so there might be some additional flickering;<br />3. The NES will not be able to properly overlap the window on top of the background;<br /><br />To help with problem number 1, you could maybe assign all black palettes the the tiles that should be outside of the visible area and mask *most* of the garbage, but that would get in the way of treating the 32x30 name table as if it were 32x32 (which requires all palettes to look the same). Mid screen scroll changes also would ruin this solution.<br /><br />Flickering is not such a big issue, we're used to flickering sprites. There could be a few games that use sprites for static objects that could look weird when flickering, but I don't expect that to happen very often.<br /><br />The window is also a big issue, but most games I can think of use it like a background scroll split, and don't really require actual overlapping of the layers. Some games certainly do though, and those will look slightly broken.<br /><br />If this approach is used, the overhead will be all in emulating the CPU and the memory map, and we'd get better performance, but there would be a few graphical issues. To get a perfectly clean display, you'd have to emulate the VRAM in PRG-RAM and periodically render the entire screen in software, which would be significantly slower!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Memblers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />This thread reminded me of an emulation approach I thought of a while back, if you want to hear my weird mapper-assisted idea.<br /></div><br />Mapper assistance is cool and all, but if you're gonna go that route you might as well go all the way and put an entire Game Boy in the cartridge.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I always thought a Colecovision emu for NES would be amusing<br /></div><br />I don't know how I'd approach the coloring of the background in that one.

No, NES only have 2K RAM and 2K VRAM, which is four times less than GB has. It could have any amount of extra RAM and VRAM on cartridge, though. Existing mappers allows up to 32K for both (in 4K or 8K pieces, with paging).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Tue Nov 12, 2013 7:02 am</p><hr />

Well, NES has 32kb of RAM, isn't it? And 8+8kb = 16kb. Dedicating first (or last) 16kb of NES RAM for GB and using only first (or last) 16 for actual emulation (perhaps with custom mapper) we could do it. Granted 16kb isn't much, but so is 32kb (even if it is twice as large).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4924">darkhog</a> — Tue Nov 12, 2013 5:44 am</p><hr />

This thread reminded me of an emulation approach I thought of a while back, if you want to hear my weird mapper-assisted idea.  I always thought a Colecovision emu for NES would be amusing, so on with my Squeedo mapper I wondered how well it would work if the on-board PIC emulated the Z80.  When doing video/sound/controller I/O it would trigger an IRQ for the NES to handle it.  This PIC (18F family) has up to 64kB of ROM, and 3.9kB of RAM.  One problem I can forsee is if the game does a lot of VRAM reading, the PIC would have to request it from the NES and that could bog down.  I don't know how frequently, obviously it would vary widely.  We all know that's almost never done on NES, but Coleco has 1kB of RAM and 16kB of VRAM, so it's not hard to imagine how it'd be useful.  And it sorta helps that it can access VRAM during rendering, heh.<br /><br />Can't say I ever wanted to write a Z80 emu for PIC, but I would probably try to use it if it existed (maybe compiling a C version could work, I never really considered that).  I know someone who wrote a 6502 emulator for PIC, I've been telling him he should make it available for this kind of fun stuff.  Then one could run their code on a faster emulated CPU, on the NES.<br /><br />Also funny to note in this thread, is that the CopyNES debugger &quot;Microbug&quot; emulates a 6502 on the 6502.  It's pretty nifty to see it in action.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Nov 11, 2013 11:18 pm</p><hr />

I think, unless you use something fancy like VRC7, emulated sound would be crap here... Better would be to write GB Emu for C64 (6502 as well), since GB sound is closer to SID really, in terms how it sound like, than 2A03.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4924">darkhog</a> — Mon Nov 11, 2013 5:02 am</p><hr />
