		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That'd be nice. If I remember well, this cross-assembler had many attractive features. We could still use it through DOSBox, but meh, that is extremely impractical.<br /><br />Was it written in X86 assembly? I ask because you said it could be &quot;ported to C&quot;... I do not know if it would be necessary to port the whole thing to C to get it run on 32-bit systmes. I have no knownledge in X86 assembly whatsoever, but probably he just need to change some instructions to get it run on 32-bit, similar to how a 6502 program could easily be made to run (although sub-optimally) on a 65c816.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />According to its readme, it was written in Turbo Pascal.<br /><br />Edit: Also, it'd be a fair bit more complicated to port the assembly, as this is software running in an operating system; it'd have to be changed to work with Windows rather than DOS. Furthermore, there's some major differences between 8086 and modern assembly especially regarding how memory is handled (e.g. segmentation).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />An <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=17238" class="postlink">unrelated thread</a> reminded me of this one.  I started this thread almost 2 years and wanted to note what all I've &quot;accomplished&quot; with regards to the subject:<br /><br />Tracking down Norman was both easy and difficult.  Most of what allowed me to get the info I dug up was my memory (where he was from, some minor personal details, etc.), combined with some extensive Googling.  Relevant info was quite &quot;deep&quot; into search results, and I had to know exactly what I was looking for.  I had to keep a Word document with all the details/stuff I found just to make sure I was following the right trail.  I have to admit I came across some personal stuff (family matters, incl. property ownership, businesses, deaths, etc.), which made me feel extremely invasive of privacy.  I knew Norman &quot;decently&quot; but nothing about his family, so this felt very awkward for me.  Part of it is also that he's Chinese, and as a Mandarin speaker I'm familiar with general Chinese culture, so this made it *extra* uncomfortable for me.  I wasn't expecting to find the stuff I did is all, and I have no clue what the dynamics/relationships are within the family, so I had to go out on a limb.<br /><br />The best I was able to do was track down his younger brother on Twitter -- sounds crazy, but I have some random old info from BBS days that connect the two brothers together, so that's how I knew it was the right guy -- but he doesn't use it for anything other than RT's and trying to win free stuff in giveaways.  That allowed me to indirectly find his brother on Steam, where I added him.  Several days later I had the chance to talk to him (brother).  Needless to say, it certainly sounded creepy (&quot;hi I'm this old friend of your brother's during the 90s, blah blah, I wanted to ask him some questions about some old software he wrote, how could I get in touch with him&quot; -- it would make me think &quot;yeah sure, WEIRDO {delete}&quot;), but I did get a definitive answer: Norman's on Facebook, so I should find him and talk to him there.  I didn't push the matter any further, and removed his brother from Steam (respecting privacy etc.).<br /><br />Thing is... I absolutely <span style="text-decoration: underline">hate</span> Facebook (way more than any other social media platform).  I gritted my teeth for weeks, but eventually took the plunge and re-enabled my account from days of early Facebook days, and found + added Norman + crossed my fingers.<br /><br />Sadly it's gone no where.  I've done this at least 3 times in the past 2 years, but he never adds me back, and due to privacy settings obviously doesn't accept private messages from non-friends.  I haven't managed to find him anywhere else.<br /><br />So I'm kind of at an impasse.  I have one final way to try and get in touch with him via phone, but it feels a bit too invasive considering it's a family/work-related phone number.  I may end up having to re-add his brother and say hey, your bro didn't get back to me, is there an Email address or something...?  The problem with the latter is that it seems pushy -- like for all his brother knows, I'm some weird stalker, or maybe I'm some guy trying to collect on old debts, or who knows what.  You know?<br /><br />That's my status update.<br /><br />As for the assembler itself:<br /><br />Given Norman's background and skill set, x816 is certainly a combination of Turbo Pascal and x86 assembly.  Turbo Pascal did not have good memory management capability back in the late 90s (read: no native EMS or XMS support) -- I know because I extensively looked at the time so that I could make TRaCER (also in Turbo Pascal) linearly allocate more than ~60KBytes of memory and found nothing (that's why it's so slow: it literally reads from disk N bytes correlating with opcode+operand) -- so odds are Norman coded the XMS support himself.  In the early 2000s there was a 386 protected mode extender for Turbo Pascal 7.x called Swallow, but the last x816 release was in 1998.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I use to use x816, it was the best back then. It was the first one I came across that had +/- labels; blew me away... now I just know I was really missing out in my youth. <br />Sadly the info I have on Ballistics is limited, seems they were an Canadian outfit, CSDB doesn't really cover NTSC land too well. However it seems Minus is also Nuclear Waste (Norman ) the other listed member is Thought Criminal aka Dave O'Neill. Demo groups tend to stick together unless they have a massive break up. Maybe tracking down Dave will get you an &quot;in&quot;. or perhaps Y0shi is still around? Gideon Zhi is.. <br /><br />Although as good as x816 was it is a product of the time....
