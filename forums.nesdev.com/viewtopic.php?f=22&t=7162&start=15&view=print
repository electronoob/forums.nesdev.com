It's interesting how different nesdevers come up with a lot of the same ideas (or are using some ideas that float around here on this site, etc.). I've made a lot of my own dev tools as you have, and have also considered polishing them up some day and releasing them...some day there's going to be an embarassment of riches in this community in the way of tools! Part of me thinks that anybody with similar ideas should pitch in to an existing project like NESICIDE, though, rather than each of us make our own tools available.

<br />True, I have a nasty habit of re-inventing the wheel. Though I find I learn a lot more when I do so.

<br />
<br />I recently spoke with a friend of mine who works in the pro game dev industry. It sounds like it is a fairly universal problem, that most game developers have to create some sort of custom tools. I guess the problem is there are just too many ways of doing everything. Even in NES development I think this is the case. I guess some tools are starting to come out which may standardize map editing, but even there there are lots of ways to do things like how you apply properties to your maps.
<br />
<br />I agree, one does learn a lot by re-inventing the wheel. When I started nesdev, I didn't understand how graphics were put together at all, all I had was NES101 tutorial by michael martin. I knew there was YY-CHR, but I couldn't figure it out. So, I wrote my own graphics editor to learn...and it ended up evolving into a tool that I use every day for my game. It's very useful *for my game* but it is hard to say whether it'd be useful to others. Probably the best hope is for the community to eventually pitch in to something like NESICIDE and then there will be "*a* way" to make a game---but it probably still won't be quite as robust as doing everything yourself...that's just the nature of game development. If you want something unique, your own, you gotta do most things yourself.

<br />Yep. Though after having created all of my own custom tools I will have gained enough knowledge to help with projects such a NESICIDE, and hopefully I can.

It's like battle kid's videos, but it's with making the actual engine, not more levels, which I like since we understand the technical level mostly here, we like to see what you add in order and stuff (I do) but this makes me want to start a blog like this. I will probably just do a text-file though since I don't have any video, but then it can show people what took longer to make, what gave me trouble, how I break my crap then fix it and stuff like that. Nomatter who's game, I think it's fun knowing what they went through when making it. Like Defender and their blowing of the ROM's when they put them in backwards! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Haha but these blogs are cool, keep making them, they're a great idea IMO. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />It sure needs the help, it does.  I've experienced the same stagnation, procrastination, and excitement working on NESICIDE as I read you guys do with game projects.  Of course, the whole thing started because I was interested in creating a game.  I guess the emotions of software development are universal to all types of software.

<br />Join us on #nesicide on freenode.net, or post on forums.nesicide.com if at all interested.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  I'm busier with work these days so not on quite as often as I'd like, but...still hoping to eventually "finish" this thing.
