I don't think its the Japanese that were uptight, but the Americans; think about the Famicom game Sky Destroyer where you play as a the pilot of a Japanese Zero fighter and shoot down endless waves of American Corsairs and Hellcats. <br /><br />That game was never released outside of Japan.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4236">SatoshiMatrix</a> — Sun Apr 24, 2011 10:18 pm</p><hr />

You can often check the Japanese Wikipedia for information about how things were received in Japan, but surprisingly, there's nothing there about the obvious irony of a Japanese game where you shoot down hordes of Japanese planes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sun Apr 24, 2011 8:19 pm</p><hr />

I was playing 1942 the other day and started thinking: here's a game about destroying the Japanese air fleet during World War II... and it was developed by a Japanese company.<br /><br />Was/is this series of games well received in Japan?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=88">James</a> — Sun Apr 24, 2011 8:08 pm</p><hr />
