I've got a few FDS disks I'd like to get backed up, and I was told he's the guy I need to talk to, but emails sent to him are bouncing.  Chris Covell was trying to reach him for me, but said neither of the addresses Brad listed in his docs are working now.
<br />
<br />If he's not available these days, is there anyone else around with the equipment to copy FDS disks?

<br />
<br />Is it that you don't have an FDS drive?  Because the FDSLoadr cable isn't too hard to make.  Then again, sometimes even it dumps with errors, but it dumps many (most?) games relatively well.
<br />
<br />Kyuusaku,
<br />
<br />Are you copying disks drive to drive, or are you using something like Disk Hacker or a Bung unit?
<br />
<br />Skrybe, what are on the disks, btw?
<br />

<br />Cool, that's better than drive to drive anyway, since it's not lossy.  I asked because if Skrybe's disks are dying, sometimes copying them to new disks via a non-lossy method is the next best thing you can do, if f a disk is getting weak, especially if it is a third-party disk and not an offical NCL one.
<br />
<br />Skrybe,
<br />
<br />I almost forgot...I have BT's email address from some exchanges a couple of years back, but I think it's the same one that might be in the FDSLoadr docs.    Also, I'm not so sure he'd back up your disks.  I'd do it, but I no longer have a win 98 machine,  Actually, I do have a laptop that might work....I could give it a shot.    Except, I know it did something incorrectly....I casn't write to disks cuz my FDS isn't modded (nor is it a 7201), but I *think* it dumped disks and loaded to the FDS RAM adapter just fine.
<br />

<br />Yeah, I don't have an FDS drive.  I wouldn't mind getting one, but finding a working drive is so hit and miss.
<br />
<br />The games are Bishoujo Hanafuda Club and Kobayashi Hitomi no Shocking Tennis, both porno games from Hacker International.  Neither one is publicly available in .fds format, AFAIK, and I wanted to get them out there for everyone to try.  I've also got a verson of Disk Hacker I'd like to get backed up, if possible.  It wouldn't be terribly useful as an .fds image, but it'd be interesting to fool with.  I'm definitely willing to send them your way if you want to give them a look.
<br />
<br />And what's the email you have for Brad?

<br />
<br />Hi Skrybe,
<br />
<br />I can probably dump these for you.  No guarantees, since, like I said, even FDSLoadr doesn't always dump perfectly, but if it works after being dumped, it came out fine.  Which version of SDisk Hacker is it?  I may already have my own image I dumped ready to send to you if you need it.
<br />
<br />PM me to discuss address info and such.
<br />
<br />-Rob

He also sells them on ebay under that same screen name. PM him at that forum and he can work something out for you. He has experince and knows of a suppler which makes a high quality drive belt that works well as a replacement for the FDS belt which wears out so easily. He also knows how to realign heads and do all the other calibration you could ask for.
