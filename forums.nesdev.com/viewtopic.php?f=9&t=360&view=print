		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am planning on replacing at least 50 batteries in 50 of my NES carts.  I want to make storing these carts safer, i.e. without the battery installed, and I also want battery installation to be very quick and easy and I also don't want it to require any tools, except for a screw driver.
<br />
<br />So, I ordered a variety of CR2032 battery holders from DigiKey.com and none of them are a perfect match.  Either they are too tall to fit inside the cart case, or the spacing between their +/- terminals is too far apart to fit nicely into the current PCB holes.  Here are the ones I tried:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.batteryholders.com/cr2032.shtml">http://www.batteryholders.com/cr2032.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />It looks like I can make the BA2032SM holder work, but since its terminals are too far apart, I will only be able to solder one directly to the PCB terminal.  The other holder terminal will just have to be soldered to an inactive part of the board, right at the edge near the battery.  Then I will have to run a very small and short wire around the edge to other side of the terminal on the back of the PCB.  I just hope it can be done as cleanly as possible, and still be very strong and sturdy.  The BS2032SM is a pretty user-friendly older.  Battery insertion is easy, as is the case of all holders, but what sets this holder apart from the rest is how easy it is to remove the battery.  You just press this little button to eject it.  The holder is also shock resistant, so it won't accidentally eject the battery if the cart is shaken or dropped.
<br />
<br />My question is, does anybody know of a battery holder that is a perfect match for NES carts?  Not too tall, but also as the correct spacing between the terminals for thru the hole mounting/soldering.
