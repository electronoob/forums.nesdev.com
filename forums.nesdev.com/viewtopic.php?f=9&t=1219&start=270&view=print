		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'll begin working on the 3197 once a complete set of data is available (all 16 initializations).  It appears the first initialization bit is sent five cycles later than the 3193/3195 (cycle 40 instead of 35).  The amount of time between the init transmission and the first seed transmission appears to be the same, but it also appears that $07 is set to an even number, suggesting (if the same formula was used) that it must start out set to 8, which would cause an extra two-cycle delay.  Thus, either two fewer cycles occur before the first seed transmission, or the number of bits to transfer is determined in a different way.
<br />
<br />I will be able to tell more precisely what is going on as soon as dumps are available for all 16 starting points.
<br />
<br />EDIT - I decided to try to work with the 3197 data anyway (mainly from boredom).  I may be able to figure out the seeds without having all 16 datasets after all.  I have already deduced the values of $01-07, $0F, and $1F (to my own surprise).
<br />
<br />In the process, I learned something very interesting.  The contents of $07 do NOT affect the number of bits sent at the first transmission.  It appears that $07 starts out set to 14 on th 3197, which would mean a submission of only ten bits.  However, 15 bits are transmitted in spite of this setting.  Subsequent transmissions, however, do appear to use $07 to determine the number of bits to send.

<br />Woot!  It does indeed work on the real thing.  I am testing it with a real 3195 acting as a lock, and it's working nicely.   
<br />
<br />Great job on finding those seeds so fast!  I knew it'd probably be possible, but not that quickly.  As for the 3197, I will start dumping it here in a minute once I re-configure my board for dumping.
<br />
<br />As for the 3196, I might have a source for a few of those, so we can knock that out if/when I get the chips.  I am curious if the 3196 has the same algo as the '3 or '5... or if it's got the newer '7 algo.   Only when I get the chips will we know I guess.
<br />
<br />I still haven't been able to come up with a source for 3194's yet.

<br />There's more than enough data - that's not the problem.  The issue is that Nintendo did a better job picking a starting seed.  I have improved (slightly) on how many bits I can determine with certainty, so it probably won't take weeks to go through all possibilities remaining, but I still don't have it down to where I'd like it to be.
<br />
<br />Bear in mind that it's always possible for my brute-force tester to find the correct answer five seconds after I post this message.  Then again, it may be a couple of days before I have it.  But, I will have it eventually, and I am committed to finding the seed as quickly as possible.

<br />KEY: x79AA1E0D019D99
<br />LOCK: 558937A00E0D66D
<br />
<br />The lock seed definitely needs long-term testing here.  I know for a fact that this is not the only possible outcome - others exist that produce different internal results after hashing without affecting the output.  It's possible that some bits in the seed are "don't care" bits and never impact the output result (if so, Nintendo really messed up the algorithm), but I will feel much better if my results (for both the 3195 and the 3197) survive at least 24 hours without a hitch.  (The issue isn't as big with the key seed, since the restrictions on $07 eliminate most duplicate results very early on, within the first 20 hashes or so).
<br />
<br />Be forewarned that the 3197 burns five extra cycles before the initialization phase, and that the first seed transmission is ALWAYS fifteen bits long ($07 has no impact on the first transmission).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I now realize why I was seeing duplicate results that didn't seem to get resolved with extra data.  It appears to be a case of bad luck in terms of the number of times the hash function is executed per frame.  The good news is that there's only a small number of cases that need to be tested to ensure every bit to be valid - the problem is waiting for them to occur in the wild.  With the "key" seed, it's easy to encounter every case by analyzing the differences between the different initial seedings.  For the lock seed, however, it's more difficult to weed out the bad results because you only get one initial seed to work with.
<br />
<br />With this new knowledge, I can now safely say that if the chip works for a minute or two, it should never fail afterwards (it'll be practically impossible for a bad bit to slip through the cracks for several seconds, let alone a full minute).  Since my findings have now been verified to run for over an hour, I think it's safe to say we have the correct seeds.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, it may not be a bad idea to run multiple long tests, just to make sure nothing weird happens down the line.  You never want to run the risk of putting one of these chips in a PowerPak (or whatever), sell it, have the customer play for an hour or so and suddenly have the thing reset unexpectedly (although frankly, I did have that precise issue occur once while playing Blaster Master a few months ago - I guess a speck of dirt interfered or something).

<br />Anyway, this is GREAT WORK !! Now, almost all consoles (exept asian ones) can definitely be lockless to developpers !
<br />Last thing, is there any hope to have all 3193, 3195 and 3197 in a single chip that will detect wich is the good one ? The lazy way would be to just jump from one programm to the other, so the console will blink one or more time in function of it's region, but will always end up working. A less lazy way could be detecting from where the seed is from, but it definitely looks like hard to do.

<br />
<br />That's the exact method kevtris is planning to use, except with one minor modification: you will need to push the reset button multiple times before it will work. The reason is that once the reset light starts flashing, the lockout chip inside the console has <strong>completely halted</strong> and is no longer listening to the incoming data stream.
