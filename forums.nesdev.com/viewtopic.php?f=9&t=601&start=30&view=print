<br />
<br />Now, if we had a similar schematic of the NES Top-loader's video output path, we could compare it and see how simple a modification needs to be.  The schematic for the video output of the Famicom AV is about as simple as you can get.  I assume that Nintendo either neglected to add the 560pf capacitator, used wrong resistor/capacitator values or introduced an interference causing element through bad traces.  It would be easier to trace the NES Top Loader's output because it does not use the inside of the PCB to run traces.

<br />Picture is realy the best for an 2C02 but nothing is better than an RGB one!
<br />
<br />By the way, I did the rgb mod on my AV famicom and it work fine, It's the best console for that since it had an normal MultiOut connector on the back.
<br />
<br />I'm using your first RBG amp, I can't get the new one to work I'm using 2N3905 PNP instead of BC557 (nearly impossible to get in canada) maybe the probleme is there...

If you remove it, you can put in either the composite video RCA jack or put in a stereo 1/4" jack for (mono) audio and video out (on different portions of the pin) and use an RCA converter to split the signals, unless it would make a difference in picture quality.  That way you could avoid drilling holes in your top loader.

Plus, I strongly suggest that you have you RCA jacks as far away from where the old RF connector is.  You want to minimize the amount of noise you pick up from the power supply.  It tends to be the nosiest section in the system.

<br />
<br />The mod involves replacing the original PPU with an RGB PPU like those found on the Playchoice 10 or whatever.  This isn't perfect, however, since the emphasis bits don't work right any more.   Games such as Just Breed will show up as solid grey since it turns all 3 bits on.  Also, it is missing that dark grey palette entry for some reason, so games that use it will look... odd.
<br />
<br />As for s-video, it can't happen 'cause the NTSC (or PAL) video exits the PPU fully formed.  I guess you could add an RGB to NTSC converter chip onto the output of an RGB PPU to get s-video, but that's about it.
<br />
<br />You could obviously use a filter to split the NTSC video up into Y and C, but this kinda defeats the purpose since the damage is already done.

<br />
<br />I'm actualy working on this, I will use a Sony CXA1645 from a PSX for getting Composite Video and S-Video. I have buy lot of stock from Digikey recently, all I need Is an old PSX for the CXA.
<br />
<br />For link everything is on gamesx forum(just standart mod not S-Video):

<br />
<br />1. Do you have to do the RCA mod to accomplish this?
<br />2. Did you build a circuit so thaat you dont have to have a wire between 2 systems?
<br />
<br />I don't know maybe I just need more of an explanation. Can you supply pictures?

<br />
<br />1.  No, you don't have to create an RCA mod, but no one yet has determined the way to do it with the RF box inside the Top Loader.   I suppose you could build the same circuit and instead of sending the video to an RCA jack, you send it to the video in pin of the RF box.  Somehow I don't think its that simple.  Still, it would be useful to know for those of us who don't want to injure our precious top-loaders.  
<br />2.  Yes, see Darthcloud's pic above.  That shows the circuit you connect to the 2C02's video output pin.  You can eliminate FC2 and C6 without affecting video quality.

<br />
<br />I don't think you can simply connect the output of the video amp to the RF because the nes RF need a weak video signal, since we amp it that will result in too bright picture I think. 
<br />
<br />So you need to add two RCA jack to your top loader.
<br />Just connect the second jack to the audio pin of the RF box. 
<br />
<br />if you don't want to drill two big hole in you top loader you can also 
<br />use an 3.5mm audio jack and use an 3.5mm to Stereo cable for connecting it to your TV set.

<br />
<br />I don't think that amplification itself will eliminate the lines because earlier composite video mod, which did also amplify the signal but did not eliminate the lines.  The RF unit, which also amplifies the signal, does not cause the interference because it is also seen with the older composite video mod.  If you wish to continue to use RF mod, it should be simply be a matter of adding the proper decoupling capacitator somewhere before the video reaches the RF box.
