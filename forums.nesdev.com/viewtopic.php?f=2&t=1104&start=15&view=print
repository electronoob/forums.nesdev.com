You can even have good graphics wihtout using incredible tricks on the NES, I'm convincted.<br />And I honnestly think that you'll play a game for it's gameplay.

Howver, a game pulling 3D graphics but that totatly fails in anyother aspects (i.e. Elite) isn't a good game.<br /><br />Okay for say demo could work, but personally I'd be pretty proud once I'll release my first NES game... with very standard graphics for the NES, but with I hope fair gameplay and fun.

<br />LOL !!
<br />I'm now drawing overloads of isometric maps during scool course. It's really amusing. However, I think multilayering can really help the task a lot, so I'm rather thinking about a SNES isometric game. Doing it on NES would me let the choise between sacrify a MMC5, leving me only a MMC1 for my big RPG project, "Ecological Evolution" or have very limited feature and use a standard mapper. I don't know wich choise to do. Forget until SNES, sacrify MMC5 or keep in mind for MMC1.

<br />Texture mapping on NES. Sounds like a fucking challenge. I did bumpmapping on GBC, gouraud shading and texture mapping on GBA (shipped titles). But never on an 8-bit-- that's *damn* interesting. If you say it's not possible or stupid, all you're saying is that you're not crazy enough, IMHO.

<br />Shit! Mine will not be the first NES raycaster anymore. Oh hell, mine will have to be the first with textures.
<br />
<br />I almost lost the name too, mine is called Wolf<strong>NES</strong>tein. Oh well, that's what happens when you take too long to finish stuff. Let that be a lesson for me! =)

<br />This was a gameboy game right? The first raycaster ever?
<br />
<br />Well, I played that demo (sicn.nes). It's nice to finally see a raycaster done for the NES. Mine is taking too long to get finished but at least now I can rest knowing that maybe it is because I'm implementing so many more features. The most difficult thing to get rid of was the block that shouldn't show but it does when you move towards a corner (happens a lot in this demo). The solution was quite simple, but took a very long time to figure out. The other pain in the ass was figuring out how to remove the "fisheye" (distorted walls) effect without adding too much extra complexity.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I shouldn't be saying those things without a demo in my hands, should I? =)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Talking about 3D effects... What about scaling and rotating sprites on the NES ? It would take a few pattern table space and a few code for each scanling/rotating sprite.
<br />I think scanling isn't too hard. Using the trick to have 16-bit counter and une only the high 8 bits as the pixel index should work fine.
<br />Rotating would be pretty undoable to what I currently know. Any ideas ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't know much about rotating either... at least not the kind that looks pleasant! Scaling can definately be done. Well, almost anything can be done if you don't care about the frame rate =). If each tile is used to represent 4 "pixels" (4x4 pixel squares used as the base unit, the "pixel"), we'd have a 64x60 pixel screen to work with. I'd avoid doing any attribute table operations though, and stick to using 4 colors.
<br />
<br />I think "rotozoomers" have been so extensively done in the past that there must be some fast integer way of performing them by now. Information on it probably isn't to hard to find either. Supposing it can all be calculated in the time of 4 frames, it can also be copied to the name table in this time, if you copy 240 tiles per VBlank. Hard, but not impossible. That would provide a frame rate of 15 fps. More than acceptable for the NES.
<br />
<br />Someone should try that. I just can't get excited over these things or my projects pay the price! =)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wait, I said sprites so the scaling/rotating would only apply to small object. I'm not even thinking about appliing that to the BG, because, just like texture polygons, it *can* be done but with a incredibly poor framerate.
<br />For example, FF2's map can be rotated and all, but it takes about two second when you just move a bit with the arrows keys, so of course seeing the world map is incredibly boring to the player, that should do something like 2 minutes just to see the other part of the world map.
<br />I think decent framerate is very important and cound in technical limitation.
<br />I think doing small object (not larger than 32x32 pixels) scale and/or rotating is doable.

<br />
<br />Pre-calculate it all, and load it in the buffer.
