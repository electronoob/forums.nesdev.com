Which test of "3.even_odd_frames.nes" failed?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm sorry. Let me clear out...
<br />
<br />- First, ppuCB stands for PPU color burst, mentioned somewhere in a Brad's doc. It holds 341 cycles (normal) or 340 (shorter, on odd frames).
<br />
<br />- ppu_bg_on stands for ppu background on. Quite obvious the 2001h setting.
<br />
<br />- ppucycle goes from 0 up to 340. It counts the amount of PPU cycles per scanline. When it reaches 341, it's reset and scanline increases.
<br />
<br />- So, using words: if we're on scanline 20, the amount of cycles is selected (340 or 341), but only if background is enabled; else, always 341. I increase the PPU cycle counter with the respective amount of cycles (usually, CPU_cycles * 3). If the PPU cycles is greater than 341 (or 340),  I reset it and do stuff. My emu uses precise cycle emulation.
<br />
<br />- "3.even_odd_frames.nes" fails at 3.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The scanline 20 is 341 PPU cycles long on even frames, and 340 cycles long on odd frames *if* background is enabled, correct? I use a variable called ppuCB to hold this setting (341 or 340) as the maximum cycles for that scanline. I toggle it at every frame (ppuCB ^ 1) , but it gives error #3 on even_odd_frames.nes test ROM. For my best, a PPU frame has 341*262 cycles <em>less 1</em> if on odd frames with BG enabled.

How are you handling reads of $2002 around the time that the VBL occurs?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I hate it when I waste time solving a non-problem due to lack of effort on another person's part. For example, recently I wrote a game music plugin for a media player and had the team claiming that my plugin had a bug that cut some music tracks off a few seconds early. Fine, I don't mind fixing bugs in my code. I asked whether it also cuts off when recording to disk ("diskwriter"), which would help rule out the possibility of it being a bug in their player. After being fingered as the reason a new release was delayed (which even days after a fix has still not appeared), I find out that it does <em>not</em> cut off when using the diskwriter, that it's likely a bug in the player, and that my simple test would have saved a lot of time. Even worse, I brought up the possibility of the problem days before.
<br />
<br />Ultimately the error can be put in my hands, for misjudging the seriousness of the other party I'm dealing with; if I could see that they were just doing it half-assed, I'd not waste my time with the matter at all. In other words, I form unrealistic expectations.
<br />
<br />Regarding the test ROMs, they have to address the odd situation of depending on proper operation of some aspects of that very thing being tested. This is solved using a "bootstrap" approach where the first tests rely only on fundamentals in order to prove that some other features work; later tests then build on this to prove even more features work. There are so many ways an emulator can get things wrong that it's essential to reduce the possible causes as much as possible. The bootstrap approach helps, but it means that skipping a failed ROM will cause further tests to fail not because the particular feature being tested is erroneous, but because the prerequisite features don't work.

Let's say it was my "fatal error" to have ignored the previous ROM test, I admit... but never "lack of effort", I'm tracing PPU like crazy, I wasted a lot of time studying the APU logs (previous APU tests) to finally get all tests OK. That's what I'm doing... tracing and studying the logs. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

<br />
<br />- Some ROMs use custom NMI and IRQ handlers
<br />- Long asm source files are much more difficult to deal with
<br />- Tests would take several seconds, making people think it's not working
<br />- Total code size might exceed the 8K in my devcart
<br />
<br />Overall you're still going to have multiple test ROMs, where some depend on others passing (for example, the CPU must pass basic tests before any of my ROMs will give meaningful results). It would be neat to have a comprehensive set of NES test ROM that tested everything, but the benefit over several sets would only be slight and the cost great.
