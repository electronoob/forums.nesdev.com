<br />Can a bad IRQ Counter implementation do things like that?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Possibly.  IRQs can do very strange things.
<br />
<br />But the problem might be elsewhere.  The first thing that comes to mind is PRG swapping issues.  Are you handling $8000.6 properly?
<br />
<br />
<br />Problems like this is where it comes in very handy to have a custom trace logger built into the emu.  I can't tell you how many times I've dumped a trace log with various tidbits of information to help me track down weird problems like this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i think yes, i mean when 8000.6 is clear 0x8000 is swappable and 0xC000 fixed to the second to last, the other way 0xC000 swappable and 0x8000 fixed to the socond to last.
<br />
<br />What i do when 8000 is written i check .6 and swap accordinally of what i wrote above. but i only swap the "fixed" ones since its not known what bank will the "swappable" one will have. So when 8001 is written and "command" is 6 i swap the "swappable" one.
<br />
<br />thats everything i can explain now, but i will be posting about these issue cos its really stucking my emu dev.
<br />
<br />thanks for the interest.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's a long shot, but this might be your problem (I doubt it).  At any rate, this is something you should fix:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">Anes wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">but i only swap the "fixed" ones since its not known what bank will the "swappable" one will have.</div>
<br />
<br />It should be known -- it's what was written to $8001 when the mode was set to 6:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #$06<br />STA $8000<br />LDA #$05<br />STA $8001&nbsp; &nbsp;; page 5 @ $8000, 2nd last page @ $C000<br /><br />LDA #$46<br />STA $8000&nbsp; &nbsp;; 2nd last page @ $8000, page 5 @ $C000<br /></div>
<br />
<br />setting $8000.6 essentially "flips" the $8000 and $C000 areas.  Just like setting $8000.7 "flips" the left and right pattern table.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the info. I always had that doubt about the mmc3 and i 
<br />corrected it in that aspect now.
<br />
<br />Regarding the problem it seems there are 2 wich can mess up the emulation. Or The stack is messed up (wich would be a CPU emu bug) or as im allocating memory (malloc) for mappers it seems the "heap" is changed or destroyed (i mean no deallocating). If the prg-addr rom is written i DONT change the prg-rom i mean would be ridiculous since its "ROM" so im using function pointers and an array of byte ptrs to map so it results in "swap" (as you teach me a little post ago).
<br />I think the heap is changed since i have a little MessageBoxFormated() when the opcode is not found wich i pass an str and a value (the opcode) and when things mess up (mmc3) this func. shows any thing.
<br />
<br />Im using 16 pointers -&gt; BYTE lpPrgData[16] then i do a "&gt;&gt; 12" to the addr to access memory (read). I use 16 pointers and the "upper" 8 ones are not used (since rom as we know start from 0x8000).
<br />
<br />Regarding  the "stack" problem i think im doing it well i mean when a value is to pushed into the stack i FIRST write the value in the stack and then decrement it (Cpu.S--) and viceversa for poping i first increment and then read. I think there can be an stack problem since blargg mmc3 irq counter test 1-3 throw me errors in the way that the code i think when an IRQ is generated is popping 3 times the A (PLA) so it increment the stack +3 and then do a RTS.
<br />
<br />The last thing i suspected was that the ms c/c++ compiler (im using plain c, i mean i set the option "compile as c code") had errors since i put it to "optimize" the code/speed at maximum posible. But it seems NOT i compiled the emu with mingw and the same thing happens.
<br />
<br />Well maybe could be much better to put code in the post and not such large explanation of how i do things, but it would take a lot of code and maybe some things could be voided wich would result in problems.
<br />
<br />I ask and i beg  for help <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
