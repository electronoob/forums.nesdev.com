<br />Uh... why do people keep saying that we use PAL here in Brazil? The standard has always been PAL-M, which is quite different from PAL. We have always played NTSC versions of the games, no matter the console. We have always rented NTSC VHS's, and now we rent NTSC DVD's.
<br />
<br />In fact, with this whole "everything is becoming digital" thing (which I love, BTW), we're dropping PAL-M altogether and switching to NTSC for good, I guess.

The major difference between the two is the frequency of the <strong>v</strong>ertical retrace, which in turn dictates the speed of <strong>h</strong>elical <strong>s</strong>can; hence <strong>v</strong>ideo <strong>h</strong>ome <strong>s</strong>ystem.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In fact, with this whole "everything is becoming digital" thing (which I love, BTW), we're dropping PAL-M altogether and switching to NTSC for good, I guess.</div>
<br />You're actually switching to 3-component video (either RGB or YCC), which bypasses the most significant difference between NTSC and PAL (i.e. the interpretation of the color burst).
<br />
<br />I could make a clean split here.

Instead, things are released in NTSC <strong>or</strong> "near enough that like you explained before", hehe ^_^;; The same is valid for games: there's no PAL games, they would be unplayable here, unless a transcoder device is used, of course (sort of).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, something like Fx3 said. I understand that, by definition, PAL-M is a type of PAL but... still... If you read that Brazil uses PAL, you'll assume that PAL games are playable here, PAL movies are watchable here... which almost never is the case.
<br />
<br />Of course, it would be wrong to list Brazil as an "NTSC country", because that's also not true. But in practice, if you send an NTSC signal to an old PAL-M TV, you'll get the picture just fine, but without color. But if you try a PAL signal, you'll get an unwatchable rolling image. Based on that I'd say PAL-M is much closer to NTSC than to PAL.
<br />
<br />I don't know much about video signals, I admit! =)
<br />
<br />I wonder if this kind of thing happens to other countries, which are not PAL, SECAM or NTSC, and just have one of those 3 (incorrectly) assigned to them in that picture.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This works because 1. SECAM has the same timings as PAL 50 Hz, and 2. consumer video components in Europe use SCART, an RGB interconnect. Once the signals are decoded to components, they both end up as analog video with a 15.6 kHz horizontal scan frequency and 50 Hz vertical scan frequency.
