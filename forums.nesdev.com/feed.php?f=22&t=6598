Noticed one more problem in the iPhone port when playing today: one time that I reopened the game, the sound didn't work. As a little detail, when I tried to adjust the volume by pressing the +/- buttons, it adjusted the ringer volume, not the game's volume as it usually does. Closing and reopening the game fixed this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Wed Aug 29, 2012 2:16 pm</p><hr />

The problem with the d-pad getting stuck in one direction was something I saw on a pre-release build but appeared to be resolved by a code change. It's possible that iOS cancelled a touch for some reason and didn't send me a 'touchesEnded' notification. I'll have to look into that.<br /><br />Having the RetroZone link still work in landscape is a little wonky, I agree. I'll change that for the next update. I've not had trouble pulling up Notifications, losing touch or having the link re-open so I'm wondering if your config and mine have behavioral differences.<br /><br />Could you PM me with your device model and iOS version so I can see if there's a config-specific issue here? Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3794">Macifom</a> — Mon Aug 27, 2012 11:04 pm</p><hr />
