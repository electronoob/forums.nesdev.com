It's not like most flashcarts can use more than 512KiB PRG anyway, and nor can the original hardware. In hardware, only modern FPGA or CPLD reimplementations can exceed the 512KiB limit.

Sorry, I thoguth the hack was newer than it is. I had an old build with the dashing, but it seemed different from the one that was put on rom hacking in 2011. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Dwedit wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I wonder if it's possible to hack the game to Mapper 245?  Mapper 245 is a MMC3 pirate variant uses CHR bit 2 to switch between two sets of 512k PRG.  This could be done with an existing MMC3 chip, and a slightly different board layout (maybe moving a wire or something).</div><br /><br />That idea sounds promising. What board type would be the most likely donor for such a reproduction?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">infiniteneslives wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Then presumably they just expanded the 6bit prg bank registers to 7+bits.  Should be an easy setup, I've just got to get some 1MB roms to test it out.  I'll post the results when I get my hands on some chips, I don't feel like messing around with two 512KB roms.</div><br /><br />I'm eager to hear what you find out. Thanks for everyone who takes interest in this.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm kinda torn about legitimizing oversize MMC3.

To play FF3J, I need to rely on emulation, and I'd really rather not. I want to have that connection to the real hardware if at all possible. So if there's some way to hack MMC3 to work with this or change the mapper to MMC5 (which given Metal Slader Glory, can run 1 MB?) then that's what I'm seeking.

If everyone considered that the maximum amount of memory the system could handle the NES would have died much sooner than it did. I see nothing wrong in creating new mappers to support more memory, even if one of these &quot;new&quot; mappers is 99% identical to the MMC3.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SatoshiMatrix wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">That idea sounds promising.</div><br />Depending on how the game combines switchable banks at run time, this conversion might not even be possible. If it is, it will probably be harder than converting to MMC5, since the MMC5 can do everything the oversize MMC3 can, it just does it differently.<br /><br />Anyway, is there any reason for this task (converting to MMC5, I mean) to be any harder than the typical mapper hack? Since the MMC5 can do everything an oversize MMC3 can, wouldn't it just be a matter of patching all mapper writes?

Putting it on real hardware and fully documenting it just formalizes it.  Nothing about any of this is or ever will 'legitimate' IMO (at least how I define the word)...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Want me to make a big-MMC3 test ROM like the one I made for mapper 28? And while we're at it, I thought of the obvious back-compatible extension to larger PRG RAM using bits 5-0 of $A001.</div>Test roms are always good.  Although if the user already has this rom then as linariq pointed out it tests the 1MB prg capability for you.  However that's not the case for extra PRG-RAM though.  With that being a motive for people to make the leap to MMC5 it seems like a worthwhile addition.  If we were to take it one step further it might be useful to have one of those bits designate a means to put PRG-RAM in $8000-FFFF.  Possibly use bit 4 to swap out the last PRG-RAM bank with the ROM bank that is otherwise fixed to the 2nd to last bank?  Then use bits 3-0 to specify which bank is at $6000-7FFF.  Yes, a bit extreme but may as well build support for 128KB since it fits and is cheapest SRAM in large quantities.  Don't need to have it in hardware if not desirable.  Might be a good idea to use bit 5 to designate the bank in ROM as read only or r/w.  ALL of this is back-compatible.  If the sky is the limit and we're already on this path, there could be additions utilizing $A000 unused bits for added CHR capabilities.

I tried putting this translation on my GBA, via PocketNES, but after patching the font, I find that all of the text is touching, vertically, so it's kind of difficult to read. Oh well.
