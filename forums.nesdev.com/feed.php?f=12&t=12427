One quarter of the Mode 7 tilemap.  This might allow it to update in one frame, or perhaps two if there's no quick way to DMA it.<br /><br />If a player's quarter-tilemap can't be updated in one shot, some method of double-buffering is necessary to avoid visible artifacts.  But hey - there are two free quarters; the player can be switched between the quarter he's on and one of the free ones by altering the scroll parameters.  So you can update the free one instead of the live one, and move the player when it's done.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">No, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">scroll position</span></strong> and matrix parameters, and sprite positions, would be updated every frame.

I think you could get away with scrolling at 60 fps just fine, as I don't see anything wrong with it.</div><br />I mean both.<br /><br />Each time the player is put on a fresh tilemap, his scroll position is chosen to maximize the viewable area of the tilemap based on his rotation angle, and the tilemap itself is chosen so that this procedure results in the player looking at the right tiles in the right places.  But this doesn't happen every frame, so the player's position will move within this tilemap, and so there has to be enough margin in the initially-chosen position that the player won't end up seeing the edges of the tilemap before another refresh can be accomplished a few frames later.<br /><br />This gives you 60 fps scroll, on top of a slower scroll update corresponding to the tilemap refresh.<br /><br />In the attached picture, Player 2 (green) has just had his map refreshed and has been placed in an optimal position on it.  Player 1 (red) is using an old map and has thus moved somewhat from his original position.  The game will now proceed to update Player 1's map and position.<br /><br />2pmap_fzero_p2update.png<br />Of course, the calculated optimal scroll position baseline (where the player is initially going to be put) is needed to define the tilemap, so depending on how fast the DMA happens, the result may be a couple of frames old by the time it's used.  Adding normal scrolling to it every frame keeps it up to date so the player doesn't see any judder or lag, though it requires extra viewable-area margin because the player can now get farther from the baseline position before the next refresh.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Wait a minute; I just thought of something.  What if both players got updated at the same time?  With double buffering, there's no reason not to:<br /><br />2pmap_fzero_halfupdate.png<br />In this pic, both players are on slightly stale maps (one frame old) and have thus both moved a bit from their original positions.  New map data for <em>both</em> players has been properly compiled and interleaved in WRAM (ie: a miracle happens) and can thus be DMAed to VRAM in two big single-channel bursts instead of 128 little ones.  The bright area is a single 4 kB DMA that has just happened.  Next frame, another one will happen, and the players will be moved down onto the new maps.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Am I making any sense here?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6595">93143</a> — Wed Feb 25, 2015 3:53 pm</p><hr />

How much graphics DMA is involved here?  If you're scaling up to 8 32x32 sprites, that's 4 kB, but you shouldn't need to transfer that every frame.  Every two frames, maybe, if not more.  OAM shouldn't be full, and CGRAM doesn't change (much?), so there should be nearly 4 kB left for map updates.  That's about a frame to rewrite a quarter of the Mode 7 tilemap.<br /><br />If you could guarantee 4 kB of tilemap DMA every frame, you could just use two submaps of 4 kB each, and completely rewrite each one every other frame, preventing visible seams while also keeping players from crossing between maps.  Scroll positions and tilemap position offsets could be tabulated based on angle of view to give maximum valid draw distance without garbage creeping in at the edges of the picture; that way you could maximize resolution without having garbage show up near the horizon...<br /><br />It'd still probably look a bit blocky compared to the original, but I don't see why it wouldn't work.  Split-screen squishes the picture anyway, so you get less detail and maybe a nearer horizon (though caution is advised when doing anything to an F-Zero game that might give players less time to react)...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6595">93143</a> — Tue Feb 24, 2015 11:53 pm</p><hr />

Exactly. 1024x1024 pixels is a bit small for a full fledged race track. You know, if you think about it, F-Zero was really about 20 years ahead of it's time, seeing that it doesn't allow split screen. I guess the only way to do 2 player (on one console <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ) would be to have a 64 pixel black bar. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> About the sprite scaling, is it uncommon to keep switching sprite sizes as the sprite shrinks so you don't run into the sprites per scanline limit? If you were trying to scale a tree in the background that is only 8x16, but its max size is 32x64, you're going to run into problems if there are more than 8.

The DSP-1 is doing the 3D point to 2D projection stuff. The pipes in mario circuit, the players, the bananas on the track, the shells.<br /><br />It's doing polar coordinate stuff to do vector math.

You just mean that the map doesn't scroll, so both players can share the same map data at all times.<br /><br />From your description, I'm presuming F-Zero is very different than this, scrolling the map with wrapping. The wrapping makes it really hard to share, since you always need to keep the scrolling seam behind the player. Since there can only be one scrolling seam on a layer, only one player.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Tue Feb 24, 2015 11:20 pm</p><hr />

Okay, I'm not saying I want to try and make this or anything, but I always enjoyed F-Zero but found its lack of 2 player disappointing. I know how Mario Kart can do it and it seemed like it was purely a design choice, but I realized that the tile map in Mario Kart never appears to get updated, unlike F-Zero. Would this be the reason? I can't really think of a way to have 2 different tile maps given the weird nature of how mode 7 is set up. The only way I can think of it would be to change the data in the tile map mid screen using force blanking, but I don't think you would be able to update it in time without a huge gap between the top and bottom screens. I know that Super Mario Kart has a chip called the DSP-1. What is it for and what does it do? I've heard it helps the game have split screen Mode 7, but this is not very clear. Also, kind of off topic, but do you think that the SNES would be able to expand/shrink about 8 32x32 sprites through software in one frame? I hate the look of the choppy scaling in racing games that use pre rendered scaling sprites.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6683">Espozo</a> — Tue Feb 24, 2015 10:14 pm</p><hr />
