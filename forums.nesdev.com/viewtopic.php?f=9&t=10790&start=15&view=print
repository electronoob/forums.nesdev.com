I like to stay on the legal side of things, so unless the manufacturer gives me permission to, then I probably will not back it up. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />On a side note, it would be helpful if RetroZone offered some sort of service that would do that for you. But, it appears that the UVEPROMS, being modern, will last at least a century if kept in good condition, and any copyright on the game should expire by then anways, so that would make it legal to burn a ROM of the game back onto the cart. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Does anyone know if Sivak or RetroZone has mentioned this issue before? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />EDIT: I have just emailed their Customer Support now about this, so I will post what they tell me when I get a response.

Lacking a dumper, I still pulled them out and swapped them with ROMs in other things and programmed them to dump them, just so I could have backups for when they rot. Imagine having a nice piece of equipment that has failed simply because some trapped electrons in a component have migrated a few nanometers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />RetroZone's support just sent me an email. They basically said:<br /><br />-The Battle Kid carts do not use UVEPROMS<br />-There is nothing to tape over (no UV exposure window)<br />-Opening the cart would not void the warranty anyways<br />-If something did happen to the game, they are willing to reprogram it<br />-A problem with the game is extremely rare<br /><br />I asked them what type of chip they use, but they did not say in the email. The good thing is that, it appears whatever they use is not only reprogramable, but durable as well. I'm not very knowledgeable on computer chips, but if I had to guess, I think they might actually use Flash-NAND chips. According to ebay prices, they seem to be cheap to buy in bulk, they are reprogramable, and, (assuming the data is not erased and written often) supposedly very durable.<br /><br />When I get the cart I will take a look at the chips and post what I find here. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Thanks for posting this!<br /><br />I find it strange that there are no capacitors on the PCB, because every NES game I have opened up contains at least one capacitor. Could this be potentially dangerous to the cart and system?<br /><br />Also, is the CHR chip a CHR-RAM? It has the circle-imprint on it, which I usually see on SRAM chips.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I hate to ask such a noob question, but will the Battle Kid cart, for the fact that it has no capacitors, wreck my NES (model 001) or itself?<br /><br />The only carts I have seen with no capacitors are glob-top famicom carts and multicarts, so I assume that they aren't 100% necessary. But Battle Kid has full-sized chips on the board, so I think it might be a different case.<br /><br />Also, in the case that the cart is damaging, could I solder in capacitors to repair it?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was just looking at the pictures of the Battle Kid 1 cart infiniteneslives posted and I noticed that the PRG-ROM chip is an ST M27C2001 10B1, which is a OTP EPROM. RetroZone's customer support told me that if a problem occured with the game, it could be reprogrammed. In addition to this, the Battle Kid 2 cart in the picture has a FLASH-NOR EEPROM holding the data, which is guaranteed to hold its data for at least 100 years. So, from what I can gather:<br /><br />-Pre-Battle Kid 2 carts contain OTP EPROMS<br />-Post-Battle Kid 2 carts (most likely) contain Flash-NOR EEPROMS<br /><br />When I get the cart, I will confirm this information.<br /><br />Also, the ReproPak manual states that U*ROM carts should have three 0.1uF capacitors on the PCB. Should I add them to the Battle Kid cart when it arrives (It shipped today <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )?
