		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's what I've been using:<br /><br /><strong>Notepad++</strong>: I love it. I feel weird using any other editor.<br /><br /><strong>ca65</strong>: My current assembler of choice. It takes a while to setup and figure out, but once you do, there are tons of cool features you can exploit. Its versatility is unmatched by any other assembler I'm aware of. It has tons of weirdnesses too, mostly side effects of it being a single-pass assembler, but you get used to them.<br /><br /><strong>JavaScript (Chrome)</strong>: Prototyping and generation of look-up tables. I develop on many different computers, some of which belong to other people, meaning I can't always setup complex development environments or install hundreds of megabytes worth of tools, so using a language any computer can run out of the box (everyone has a browser installed!) is really handy. The main drawback of using a browser IMO is the lack of direct access to the file system, so reading and writing files can be a little awkward.<br /><br /><strong>PHP</strong>: Data conversion, image processing, and anything else that JavaScript doesn't do well. I know Python is a more popular choice for this, but I already had years of PHP experience from working on web applications, and I found it easier to setup a portable PHP installation than a Python one.<br /><br /><strong>GIMP</strong>: I use GIMP mostly as a level editor. The features I need the most are grids and layers. Grids are useful for copying and pasting metatiles of varying sizes, while layers are useful for defining other properties of the map and placing objects. I then run the images through a PHP script to generate the binary data that goes into the ROM. The reason I prefer GIMP over Photoshop for this (besides it being free, smaller and working as a portable application) is that it supports larger images than Photoshop does (IIRC, Photoshop couldn't make a 32768-pixel wide image, GIMP did it).<br /><br /><strong>FamiTracker</strong>: Music is not really my thing, but for the little bit of it I do, I use FamiTracker. I think it's hard to think of someone these days that doesn't.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br /><strong>FCEUX, Mesen, Nestopia, Nintendulator</strong>: Whichever I find more appropriate for the task at hand.<br /><br /><strong>PowerPak, Everdrive N8</strong>: For precise timing tests and occasional verification.<br /><br /><strong>EPROM programmer + socketed cartridge</strong>: Final verification.<br /><br /><strong>PAL-M front loader, NTSC top loader, AV Famicom, miscellaneous Famiclones</strong>: occasional testing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I use vim for text editing (I disabled syntax highlighting, though) and Unofficial-MagicKit (a variant of NESASM with more versatility) as a 6502 assembler. For image processing I mainly just use command-line programs I wrote myself (I used to use ImageMagick, until I wrote my own; ImageMagick doesn't handle XPM version 1 and 2, and it doesn't handle NES/Famicom format, and it can't write Dr.Halo format, etc). I use xterm as a terminal emulator. For music I use MML programs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been using ASM6 with my current project, and plan on finally trying out CA65 once I finish it. Notepad++ is nice, especially now since I recently discovered that you can organize files in a &quot;project&quot;, and have the tree-like file explorer (idk what it's actually called) on the left side like your typical IDE. The only downside is that when I upen up a .asm file it defaults to the x86 syntax and I have to manually switch to my user-defined 6502 syntax every time. Does anyone know if there's a way to remedy this? I know some people use the .s extention for assembly files, but Notepad++ already uses this for soemthing else; Scheme files, I believe.<br /><br />C/C++ I use for prototyping different sub-systems that the game'll use, and writing the occasional tool to take care of some minor trivial task. I really should start learning Python, I don't know why I haven't yet. I guess all the different libraries it has scares me, but that's a stupid excuse. A lot of the raw data I just type in by hand tbh, as I feel like 9/10 writing a tool takes more time and brain power than just typing in numbers/labels and not really having to think about it.

I just assumed custom languages would have priority over the built-in ones in case of extension collisions.

Collision info looks wrong because I was putting together something quick and none of the slope data was actually used in that project. It does a lot more than map editing, but I'd have to make a video. In the bottom middle is actually a Pyxel Edit tilemap that you can pull metatiles from. <br /><br />This level import thing: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://i.imgur.com/gnQ1uhe.png">https://i.imgur.com/gnQ1uhe.png</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Because the above editor is actually overkill for most projects. It can take in a png with collision info along with an animated set of images and spit out a whole level. It will put the animated tiles in the last bank and you can set the size of the bank swapping. In Indivisible I used it lazily for destructible walls, but it could also create tiles for things like Kirby's animated water. You have to use Tiled to add objects to a level, though.<br /><br />It also doubles as a &quot;generic&quot; restrictions checker and a few other things. <br /><br />Command line tool to split up CHR for extreme bank switching: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://i.imgur.com/D1HkJPz.gif">https://i.imgur.com/D1HkJPz.gif</a><!-- m --><br /><br />You can set whatever bank size. It makes sure all tiles needed for a frame are in the same bank, while also trying to minimize duplicate tiles in different banks. It could do a bit more with merging things not from the same character, though.

Useful in combination with NESST. For example as a middleman for anything NESST can't copy to clipboard but can export as a binary. Separate attribute tables, for example. Also useful for hand editing data in general, to be .incbin:ed in the source instead of writing .db statements. More neatly organized this way; readable code with clear filename labling.<br /><br />win 10 calc.exe - finally made into a convenient and fluent experience. Hex, bin, dec are all shown simultaneously and live. Besides full numeric keyboard, you can use a bit toggling keyboard and set word size and the memory store / recall memory buttons are useful. Full screen mode is surprisingly useful, especially with a touch screen.
