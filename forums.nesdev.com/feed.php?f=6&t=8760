I think this is something introduced in the latest beta:<br /><br />Esper Dream (FDS).nsf no longer plays anything for any of its tracks.  This applies to both the &quot;Zophar Domain version&quot;, as well as <a href="http://nsf.joshw.info/e/Esper%20Dream%20(FDS)(1987)(Konami).zip" class="postlink">the version on Knurek's site</a>.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure this NSF used to work fine, since it's one of the ones in my own archive that I updated to have proper/correct composer names.

I would much rather fix the source NSFs or just move to NSFe entirely -- plus it saves disk space (consider filesystems formatted using 32KByte clusters; one M3U file could be 1KByte, but takes up 32KBytes of actual disk) + doesn't waste an inode.  On embedded systems/platforms this matters more than you can imagine.<br /><br />There are also things like your 1943 M3U which has track 16 as &quot;Unused&quot; -- for all we know it's not actually &quot;an unused song&quot; as much at could be &quot;just some gobbledegook that got included in the rip&quot; or even &quot;an incomplete song by one of the composers / isn't used&quot;.  I throw crap like that out.  I can't tell you how many NSFs I've had where there are tracks included (at the end of the song list) that are just previous tracks with certain channels muted and so on.  Doesn't serve a purpose, and should just be part of the effects package IMO.

Did you <a href="http://jdc.koitsu.org/nsf/readme.txt" class="postlink">actually read my readme.txt</a> in full?  Your listing has absolutely no mention of what's been changed/fixed/etc..  Like I said in my earlier post, I've been extremely diligent about tracking every single change I make to the NSFs so that people would know what I changed and what I started with.  It's not about being OCD -- it's about providing something that says to people &quot;in case you wanted to know what <strong>exactly</strong> is different in these NSFs...&quot;.  It's equivalent to a code changelog, and I cannot stress how important that is.<br /><br />Anyway, this is getting off the topic of the thread.  When I posted my NSF &quot;&quot;archive&quot;&quot; link I was like &quot;I probably shouldn't do this, it's going to cause people to start analysing it and blah blah and it has nothing to do with NSFPlay&quot;.

Okay cool, I'm fine with that too.  Like I said: KISS principle in effect, since I don't have any NSFe files, in my case I can just remove %L and stop complaining, hehehe.  :-)<br /><br />Trimming whitespace off the start/end of the entire &quot;song title&quot; string would be wise.  However, I would have to advise <strong>against</strong> trimming whitespace off the start/end of individual NSF/NSFe fields.  I know that personally I've caught a few NSFs which had extraneous whitespace in their song titles (the author seemed to think &quot;32 bytes for title&quot; meant &quot;I need to pad the content with spaces&quot; -- sigh, READ THE SPEC!), and I wouldn't have caught those had I not seen them in Winamp.<br /><br />Oh, and for the hell of it: <a href="http://jdc.koitsu.org/nsf/" class="postlink">My own little NSF archive</a>, where I've been trying to clean up all of the existing NSFs whose composers/authors are wrong, fix composer names in Japanese (going with the naming convention of Firstname LASTNAME (family names/surnames in Japanese are usually written in Romaji in all-caps to denote they're a family name)), fixing incorrect sound chip enable/disable bits in the header, and removing sound effects (those should really be in their own files).  I've been meticulous about maintaining that readme.txt every time I make a change.  All those composers/etc. I really did have to spend quite a bit of time digging up online -- vgmpf, vgmdb, and wikia.com were super helpful but some others I had to dig for (plus get some folks to translate some Japanese pages).  Sadly due to the 32-byte limitation in the original NSF header for composer length I can't fit lots of composers in there.  This is where NSFe would, obviously, shine.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Aug 23, 2012 2:06 am</p><hr />

Well, my thinking was that I wanted someone to get what they request from the TITLE_FORMAT string. I don't really like manipulating it &quot;behind their back&quot; since that tends to get counter-intuitive.<br /><br />However, I might put something in to trim any leading or trailing whitespace, since there's not really a use for whitespace at the beginning or end. That sounds like a good solution to me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Thu Aug 23, 2012 1:41 am</p><hr />

Ahh got it, got it.  Hmm.  I wonder how Foobar2000 and some other programs solve this dilemma then (with the &quot;extra space&quot;).<br /><br />I guess one way is after expanding the % expandos you could collapse whitespace (e.g. in perl <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">tr/ //s</tt> or the probably-easier-to-understand <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">s/\s+/ /g</tt> (<tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">\s</tt> represents a whitespace in perl regex)) then hand that out as whatever the entire &quot;song string&quot; is.  But since this is all in C/C++... well, let's just say I never liked dealing with string parsing/copying/manipulation much in C.<br /><br />I will state up front I am totally being OCD about it, it's not a deal-breaker in the least, so you can just be like &quot;DEAL WITH IT, GET RID OF %L IN YOUR STRING IF YOU DON'T HAVE NSFe FILES&quot; and that's that, hahaha.  :-)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Aug 23, 2012 1:29 am</p><hr />

Ahh yes, I see.  So what about this: if %L is used and the file being played is NSFe, use the NSFe title.  If %L is used and the file being played is NSF, it behaves the same as %T.  I guess this could effectively nullify the need for %L entirely, so maybe it would make more sense to nuke that and replace %T's behaviour?  Sadly I don't know what the repercussions would be / if it would break existing setups.<br /><br />Basically what I'm trying to get across is that having both %T and %L in the same playback line seems redundant.<br /><br />Or with NSFe files, does %T actually represent something completely different than %L (and vice-versa)?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Aug 22, 2012 10:30 pm</p><hr />

I was just answering it by editing above. That's what it does. The space is the space that follows it in the string.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Tue Aug 21, 2012 9:01 pm</p><hr />
