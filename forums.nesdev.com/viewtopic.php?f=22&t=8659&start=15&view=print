<br />
<br />It works somehow, but the frame rate is about 25-30 fps. And the sound is weird, too. Same for FCEUX.
<br />
<br />
<br />Btw, Nice game.
<br />I made it to Level 16 in my first attempt and to Level 17 in my second attempt.
<br />But I played the whole game with B-Button pressed. Maybe I should try to play it slower and more careful next time.

<br />
<br />About the unofficial opcodes, and as already mentioned, they run just fine on real hardware, so I'd say any emulator that has a problem with them is broken. Our main concern was making it run fine on a real NES, both PAL and NTSC. 
<br />
<br />The game works fine in Nestopia, FCEUX and Nintendulator.
<br />
<br />And about flag 9 in the iNES-header, as thefox already pointed out, it sets that it's a PAL game. Most emulators just ignore this, but it seems to work as it should in Nestopia atleast. If you'd like to play it in NTSC speed you can just choose NTSC in the emulator.

<br />I really liked the graphic style, the idea of using simple meta tiles to fill the background instead of leaving it empty.
<br />Overall-Great game.Congratulations.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I finally played the game a bit and I really like it. But is there any chance you might make a version that plays at closer to the intended speed on NTSC systems? Both music and gameplay. I don't have a PAL system, and it'd be more fun to play on a real console than an emulator.
<br />
<br />But it's a nice game.

<br />
<br />I might check into making an NTSC version, fixing the music shouldn't be all that hard since MUSE is awesome and would do all that work for me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> But the speed in the game might be a bit harder, maybe I should try and do what I noticed Shiru did with Alter Ego - and just make every fifth frame be displayed twice. Shouldn't be very hard to implement.
<br />
<br />But as it is now, I don't think playing it in NTSC is that much of a problem, it works quite well in it's speedier format and the music sounds quite okay as well.
