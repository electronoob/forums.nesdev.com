Also from what I recall Star Fox wasn't exactly that cheap either, and originally the idea was to add the SVP to other games (Zaxxon Motherbase started as a SVP game, for instance). The problem is that later Sega decided that the 32X would be a better idea (yeah, in the long term you'd just pay once for the extra hardware... but it came out the same year as the 5th generation consoles).

I think also you're forgetting a very important point of the 8 MB version of the demo i made: the video codec is <strong>lossless</strong>. With a lossy codec as the one used in the 4 MB version it's much more easier to get things done. Honestly i was not interested in lossy compression if you can see it  and that is very the case here :p<br /><br />Ho and yeah, i am referring the MtChocolate version right at the beginning of the video description <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

The 4MB version which uses full resolution has (imo) heavy compression artifacts, maybe with a better encoder it could be less noticeable.
