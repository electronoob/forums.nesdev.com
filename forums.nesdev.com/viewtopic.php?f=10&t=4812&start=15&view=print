<br />
<br />Ah, yes, I didn't think of that.  Good point.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the info, nonetheless.  I'm familiar with XCode, but haven't actually used it.  Can it function as a platform-agnostic coding environment (with 6502 highlighting) or does it work solely with flavors of C?  I think I should just look for a mac version of something like ConText.  BBEdit comes to mind.

<br />I don't know how, but I suspect that you may be able to do that, if you search hard enough.  If you find out you can, please let me know too. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />You see, despite the name, NESASM is just a modified assembler for the TurboGrafx-16.
<br />
<br />Obviously there is no reason to completely slight the program, but it wont run in a 64bit environment.
<br />
<br />I prefer ASM6. It has all the features of the more robust 6502 assemblers (like unnamed labels,) is open source (no OS limitations,) and allows some neat tricks (like embedding the header into the project, and .including the Sprite and background tiles onto the end, instead of concatenating the files.)
