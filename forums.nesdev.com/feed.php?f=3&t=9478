Well, I traced down the occasional stutter to GPU memory paging as a result of a memory leak.  Along with some additional tweaks to thread priorities, everything seems to be working well without adjusting processor throttling settings or even thread affinity.<br /><br />BTW, I used <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~mdfisher/GPUView.html" class="postlink">GPUView</a> to help track this down.

I'm stretching it here, but if by missing a vblank you're referring to an actual hardware vblank (that is, on the host system, not a vblank in the emulated system), there may be an explanation.  Possibly.  At least on nVidia cards -- no idea about ATI, Intel, or on-die GPUs on present-day Core iX CPUs.<br /><br />nVidia's semi-recent drivers have enabled a crapload of vblank adjustments on a per-application setting.  The one that weirds me out the most is &quot;adaptive&quot;, because I have not the slightest idea what that does/how that functions.  I took a screenshot of the 3D settings profile page on my XP box, with the pulldown expanded, so you can see what I'm referring to.  You can also set this on a per-application (per-exe-file or per-process-name) basis.<br /><br />Aside from strange emulator bugs or Windows doing really weird crap (my vote is always on the latter, haha), the above is the only thing I can think of that might explain loss of some intervals.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Fri Nov 16, 2012 4:56 pm</p><hr />

Hmm, I can't even run nemulator on the machine i'm using at the moment. It spits out the error &quot;DX10CreateDeviceAndSwapChain&quot;. I'm using Windows 8 and DirectX11. I think the problem is that I am using the motherboard's integrated graphics, and it is only compatible with up to DirectX 9.0c functionality.<br /><br />This raises a big question, do you <strong>REALLY</strong> need DirectX10 for a NES emulator?

Thanks for the breakdown, blargg.<br /><br />The audio buffer is circular.  The red line represents the number of bytes that the write cursor is behind the playback cursor (the red area depicted below).<br /><br /><img src="http://nemulator.com/images/buffer.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />If the red area is less than one frame's worth of audio (red line low on the screenshot), then the emulator will block waiting until there is enough room to write pending data.  That will lead to a delayed video frame and stuttering.  If the green area gets too small (red line high on the screenshot), the playback cursor will pass the write cursor and there will be garbled audio.<br /><br />On the screenshot, the red gradient represents the target area, and the green line represents the playback frequency.  The graph does move right to left and represents about 4.25 seconds worth of data (256 frames).<br /><br />The jitter in the first screenshot is not a big deal, but what is problematic is the large jump above Mario's head.  That represents about a 16 millisecond gap...  or one frame.  And that got me thinking...<br /><br />What seems to be happening is that the emulator is missing vblanks, and that problem is exacerbated when processor throttling is enabled.  However, that's not the direct cause. I discovered that setting the a/v thread's affinity to one processor leads to performance in line with having processor throttling disabled.  So, good news -- I can scrap the power management stuff.<br /><br />I need to do some more work to discover why vblanks are being missed (it still, infrequently, happens).<br /><br />koitsu -- thanks for shaming me into finding a better solution <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />natt -- I discovered why timer_sync wasn't working for you.

The problem is of two master timebases which are inevitably slightly out of sync, video and audio. The monitor might claim to be 60.00 Hz, and audio 441000 Hz. If an emulator generated exactly 60.00 frames per second and 441000 samples per second, one would inevitably fall behind since their timebases aren't exactly in sync.<br /><br />Some emulators use sound as the master timebase, periodically doubling/skipping video frames as necessary. Others use video as the master timebase, letting audio drop out periodically or skip forward. As I understand it, this emulator takes a different approach of catering to both video and audio timebases, fine-tuning its audio rate on-the-fly in response to variations. To do this, it needs to accurately measure how much audio is currently buffered, so that it can adjust its sample rate by small increments. It uses some functions that find how much audio is buffered and waiting to go to the DAC in the sound card, and apparently these give unreliable results when processor speed is changed. I believe that the graph shows the results of this audio buffering query, and how it jumps around a lot when processor speed changes. This causes nemulator's audio code to think it needs to make a large adjustment to the audio rate, which I take it noticeable audibly.<br /><br />By the look of it, the graph has time on the X axis. The green is output sampling rate, higher towards the top (more samples generated per second), and the red is the number of samples buffered waiting for the sound card (higher near the top). I think that the red gradient background might be the desired level of buffering. So where the average number of samples buffered jumps up suddenly and stays there, the emulator lowers the number of samples generated per second so that the sample buffer will become less full on average. At some point, it will increase the number of output samples per second to keep the buffer at this less-full level.<br /><br />Since it looks like the queries are mostly clean even when processor speed changes, I wonder whether nemulator can ignore these erratic values.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Thu Nov 15, 2012 7:18 pm</p><hr />

I think I understand the concern -- thank you for taking the time to explain it -- but the screenshots in question are quite a bit confusing/difficult to interpret.  At this point they mean more to you than they do to me.<br /><br />All I can discern is that the top screenshot shows two red lines (am I supposed to be looking at the red gradient line, or the slightly-brighter-but-slightly-not line?), and that there is more variance there (on the vertical axis) than in the lower screenshot.  This doesn't tell me how much (on a numeric level) delta there is between the audio playback position vs. the audio write position -- what's rendered in the top screenshot could indicate a 10ms delta, or it could indicate a 1000ms delta.<br /><br />I also assume that the horizontal axis indicates time, i.e. this red-green-mess ( :-) ) is effectively panning/scrolling leftward at all times, with new information drawn on the right-hand side.<br /><br />At some level I still do not understand why the audio and video pieces have to be &quot;in sync&quot; with one another -- the hardware doesn't operate this way, i.e. there's a separate oscillator/crystal for audio than there is for video/PPU and they operate at two different frequencies, correct?  So why can't two separate threads (one for audio, one for video/PPU) be made to run at those rates?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Thu Nov 15, 2012 5:56 pm</p><hr />

It's a differentiating feature of nemulator and one that I wish that you could try firsthand.  I think it's a worthwhile trade-off.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Can you explain, verbosely, why it is you need to disable these CPU features?<br /></div><br />I'll try.  To recap, emulators generate video and audio output at slightly different frequencies.  To keep everything in sync, most emulators block on audio output, effectively locking the frame rate to the audio output rate.  This results in glitch-free audio output, but tearing or stuttering video output.<br /><br />Alternately, an emulator could lock to 60Hz vsync to provide artifact-free video output, but there will be audio glitches when the audio output buffer over-/under-runs.<br /><br />To address this issue, nemulator uses vsync for timing (except when it doesn't, but that's a different discussion), and dynamically adjusts the audio frequency to match the current frame rate.  Video is output at a consistent 60Hz, audio output is never blocked waiting on the output buffer to drain, and the audio buffer is never under-run.<br /><br />In order to determine the difference in audio generation and playback rates, I check the playback and write cursor positions of the sound card's primary output buffer.  If the distance between the two pointers is consistent -- the goal -- that means that the buffer is being drained at the same rate that it's being filled.  If it's not, audio frequency is adjusted to compensate.<br /><br />So, why does processor throttling interfere with this?  When processor throttling is enabled, processor frequency -- and therefore the time between vsync occurring and the audio buffer being filled -- will vary depending on system load.  Usually, this 'jitter' isn't too bad, and can be accounted for.  But on occasion, there will be large differences that can result in under-runs.  Here's an example.  The red line represents the number of bytes between the playback and write cursors:<br /><br /><img src="http://nemulator.com/images/throttling.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />With processor throttling disabled, latency is much more consistent, and large differences generally don't occur:<br /><br /><img src="http://nemulator.com/images/no_throttling.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />There's a couple of ways to account for the increased jitter with throttling enabled.  I can increase the buffer size, but that can result in noticeable latency between video and audio (e.g., you hear Mario jump later then it happens on-screen).  I can make larger/faster adjustments to audio frequency, but that can result in noticeable pitch changes.<br /><br />So, at the end of the day, temporarily disabling processor throttling provides the best results.  I agree that there are downsides, but I think the benefits outweigh those.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=88">James</a> — Wed Nov 14, 2012 9:26 am</p><hr />

Which program might that have been? I don't remember having inserted any calls to Windows services to change system color settings in any of my own programs. The only system setting that I remember changing is the screen resolution and bit depth when a program is run in full screen. Might Windows have altered the colors itself if it crashes in a 256 color mode and for some reason can't restore the 16-, 24-, or 32-bit mode that your desktop normally uses? Was it running under Windows 9x or under Windows XP?<br /><br /><strong>Status:</strong> incomplete<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Nov 14, 2012 6:42 am</p><hr />

I remember that one of Tepples's own PC programs had a problem where it would alter Windows settings (colors of controls) if it crashed or was killed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Wed Nov 14, 2012 6:25 am</p><hr />
