A human viewer will perceive motion if a series of images each has small changes in the positions of objects. It's up to your code to make these changes. Since speed is based on how much an object changes position in a given time, you can increase it by having an object make a greater change in position each time it moves.

So it's pretty much just like you'll have x_position_hi as your sprite's X Position. When you have $01 as the x_pos_hi value, and $80 as the x_pos_lo, your sprites X_Pos will be $01. But add $0180 to those values, and you'll get $0300, thus, making your sprites X_Pos $03. Do you understand?

<br />
<br />Use it!  A shooting (or any kind of) game with frame-based movement is limiting to design and horrible to play.  I know because I wrote one a long time ago, heheh.  You get 3 speeds, stopped, too fast (2 pixels/frame), or too slow (one pixel/frame).  Even doing the "wait X frames before moving X pixels" is pretty bad, and a major pain to code.
<br />
<br />Using this simple 16-bit fixed-point movement you get 256 usable speeds between each of those 3.  It's like Celius said, the sprite position itself can be a 16-bit number, but only the upper 8-bits are used on-screen.  And the movement speed too should be a 16-bit number, the lower 8-bits just accumulate and only affect the sprites on-screen position when it wraps-around and carries over.  No delays, you calculate the movement+position on every frame.

<br />
<br />Now, the way i've multiplied the decimal number part and the whole number part, i think that's wrong because i worked out 2.3 times 4.5 on paper and it had lots of carries.  Big carries that increased the digit range by two.. (2.3 x 4.5 = 103.5)  So im not sure about multiplying, if it's correct or horribly wrong.  
<br />
<br />i still sometimes think the multiplying is correct because, when firing to the north west, the bullet goes really fast like normal.  But, firing to the south east makes the bullet go as fast as the ship (as fast as it was before the speeding up code).
<br />
<br />If the multiplying is wrong, im not sure what to do.

<br />Also, sucessive additions aren't the best way to multiply two variables.
<br />Use bit shifts to do it faster, even if this is a bit confusing to do at first.
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; lda #$00<br />&nbsp; ldx #$08<br />- lsr num_0<br />&nbsp; lsr A<br />&nbsp; ror ProductL<br />&nbsp; bcc +<br />&nbsp; clc<br />&nbsp; adc num_1<br />+ lsr num_1<br />&nbsp; dex<br />&nbsp; bne -<br />&nbsp; sta ProductH</div>
<br />This will add the fraction of num_1 each time a bit in num_0 is set. Then the result (the accumulator) and the num_1 variable are shifted cause the next bit is more significant. This happens 8 times because this is a 8-bit multiply. If you'd stick with less bits, you could simplify this. Also I'm not 100% sure to have done it right, because it is a bit confusing, but such a thing (or something close to it) works perfectly and accurately, with constant execution time, and is considered better by most programmers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For anybody who's interested, I made a small, almost-user-friendly test ROM that allows you to change scrolling speed to a more adjustable one. I mean, you can make it scroll like 1.5 pixels per second if you want, or even something like $01.F1 if you really wanted to. It's just a demo that allows you to see how free you are in terms of scrolling speeds. You can get it here:
<br />
<br /><!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/ScrollSpeedTest.nes">www.freewebs.com/the_bott/ScrollSpeedTest.nes</a><!-- w -->
<br />
<br />It's not quite complete as it should be. What you do is you are just adjusting each digit by pressing up and down, and to switch digits, press right or left. You start out being able to edit the last digit. So if you press up, you'll change the speed from 00.00 to 00.01. It's really easy to understand, the only problem is you don't want to press too far over on direction, because you'll start editing other sprite tile values instead of the ones on screen. I should have put a cursor in there to show you which digit you are editing, but I didn't, and if someone really wants me to do it (I highly doubt anyone cares that much), I will, I guess. Just fiddle around with values to see exactly how much freedom you are given with scroll speeds / sprite movement speeds.
