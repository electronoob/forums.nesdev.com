And if you make a game in a Latin-alphabet language (e.g. English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Esperanto), and you distribute cartridges to the public, most players will have a 72-pin NES that has <em>not</em> been modified for expansion sound passthrough.<br /><br />In the following paragraph, try plugging the bold words into Google:<br /><br />Once you have your game, you'll want to open the game's case, desolder the PRG ROM, and solder in a <strong>DIP socket</strong>. Then you'll want to store your program on a <strong>flash memory</strong> chip (<strong>29F040</strong> series is common) using an <strong>EPROM programmer</strong> such as one made by <strong>Wellon</strong> or <strong>Willem</strong>. Then pop the ROM into the socket and hope it works. Most boards made by Nintendo need a few wires to be rerouted due to cost- and space-saving shortcuts that Nintendo took, but <strong>ReproPak</strong> boards from retrousb.com won't need rewiring.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Feb 04, 2011 3:36 pm</p><hr />

Are you sure Konami carts use JDEC standards for MaskROMs? I thought they did the same pinout rewiring that Nintendo MaskROMs did.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Fri Feb 04, 2011 12:35 pm</p><hr />

Is it just me or tepples makes his best attempt to disgust newcommers ?<br /><br />You can make an VRC6 cart, the most difficult part is probably to find one... you'd have to import one of the 3 japanese games that used it.<br /><br />As tepples said, the powerpak is probably the easiest/best way to go, but keep in mind that the VRC6 chip itself might not be 100% accurately emulated, it's possible that the powerpak could act differently from a real VRC, but as long as you stick to regular things, it'll be ok. If you rely on really weird "tricks" on those channels (like the semi-doccumented "direct-offset" mode of pulse channels) then you're blind without an actual VRC cart.<br /><br />After that it's probably not a problem to open it and replace it with wathever ROMs you want in it, as long as you don't replace them by a commercial game and sell it for a higher price (which thankfully doesn't seem to be your intentions at all) it'll be ok. It's a Konami cart, not Nintnedo so things are actually easier : You won't have to cut traces and add tiny wires.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Feb 04, 2011 10:09 am</p><hr />

To make a VRC6 game, first you need a supply of VRC6 chips. There are only two ways to get one of those: <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha"><li>Rip open one of the dwindling supply of VRC6 games for each copy that you plan to make. </li><li>Decap and photomicrograph a VRC6, write out its netlist in Verilog, and get an ASIC synthesized and fabricated. </li></ol><br />If you just want to listen to your NSFs, a PowerPak through the right 72-to-60-pin converter might be the easiest way to do so on a time==money basis.<br /><br />I'd imagine that most people with a system capable of playing Famicom expansion sound can read Japanese because they bought a Famicom while living in Japan. (Those who imported a Famicom or modded their NES are a slim minority, despite their overrepresentation here and on NintendoAge.) If you can't read Japanese, stick with normal carts. Those are easy to make; kits for NROM (#000), CNROM (#003), UNROM (#002), BNROM (#034), AOROM (#007), and S*ROM (#001) are available from retrousb.com.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Feb 04, 2011 9:45 am</p><hr />
