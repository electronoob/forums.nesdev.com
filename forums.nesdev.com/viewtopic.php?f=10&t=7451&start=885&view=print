I don't know what the exact limit of how many tiles you can throw to the PPU, But I think 64+Palette is fine. Although, you really only have to ever update (scrollspeed/8) rows, so if your camera only ever moves 8 pixels maximum, then you only need to upload one column ever. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
