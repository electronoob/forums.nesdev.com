SNROM doesn't use CHR-ROM A13-15 pins, I was able to fit it within 36Mcells on a XC9536XL.  Note, it sounds like you're using the 5volt variant (non-XL), and I'm using the 3.3v XL family (5v tolerant) because it hasn't been discontinued like the non-XL family.  I believe there are some minor internal differences between the two as well because I once synthesized something for the non-XL that wouldn't fit.  I then switched over to the XL equivalent and it DID fit, I could have had something messed up in my settings that explains the differences in my findings though.
