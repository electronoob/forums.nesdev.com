Here's a couple off the top of my head:<br /><br />Castlevania II - Simon's legs are visible while standing in the marsh<br />Gimmick - When starting a level, the character is visible before he drops out of the &quot;window&quot;<br />Majou Densetsu II - Character isn't masked properly when going through doors<br /><br />FWIW, I disable sprite limiting by default since it looks better and, for the vast majority of games, there are no consequences.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, NEStopia with sprite limit off seems to do the trick. Excuse the ignorance. With that, I'll use NEStopia from now on.<br /><br />Is this some kind of hack or something? Because it's not enabled by default and I personally think the games are better with it on. TMNT II: The Arcade Game is one game where I need it on. <br /><br />I presume real hardware flickers a lot more, which is why it isn't. I haven't actually had an actual physical NES since it was active.<br /><br /><em>&gt;Nostalgia has its limits</em><br /><br />Yup.<br /><br /><em>&gt;If you want a list and/or want to see some examples of what happens, I can happily provide such.</em><br /><br />Yes, please.<br /><br />The above-mentioned are welcomed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, it is a hack.<br /><br />OAM in the PPU has room for 72 sprites: the ordinary 64 sprites plus 8 more to hold the results of a search for sprites on the next scanline. This extra area can be called &quot;next line OAM&quot; or &quot;secondary OAM&quot;. Here's what the sprite unit does on each of the 341 dots of an OAM:<br /><ul><li>0-63: Refresh OAM 0-63 (because it's DRAM) and clear next line OAM </li><li>64-255: Scan through OAM and copy the first 8 sprites that are in range to next line OAM </li><li>256-319: Fetch pattern slivers for all sprites in next line OAM from CHR memory and load up the counters and shift registers that actually draw the sprites </li><li>320-340: Rest </li></ul><br />Each pattern sliver fetch (2 bytes, 8x1 pixels) takes eight dots, though it could have been optimized to four by omitting the unused nametable fetch that occurs before each pattern sliver fetch. The real limiting factor is scanning time. It takes two dots to read the Y coordinate and determine whether a sprite is or is not &quot;in range&quot;, that is, whether Y through Y+7 (or Y+15 depending on the size flag) stretches across the next scanline. If a sprite is in range, it takes six more dots to read the tile number, attributes, and X coordinate and copy them to next line OAM. In the theoretical worst case, where the eighth sprite is #63, the entire scan takes 2 * 64 + 6 * 8 = 176 dots, leaving 192 - 176 = 16 dots of idle time before pattern fetching. At this rate of scanning OAM, only two more in-range sprites could be fetched.

I say this based on my own experience with it (I used to rely heavily on said feature until I kept finding more and more games with &quot;weird sprite-related problems&quot; and eventually said f-it).
