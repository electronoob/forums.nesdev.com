When I first saw that &quot;dead&quot; lizard I had no idea what it was, so I carefully approached it and WHOA, cool! New skin! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><br /><br />Anyway, lots of cool stuff in the demo. The animations are incredible and the music is very well done. I really liked how the interaction with the other creatures isn't the typical &quot;touch it and you die&quot; you find in most games, you only die from touching what's actually dangerous. I want to see how that will affect the flow of the game.<br /><br />Speaking of dying, I have a little bug report: When you die near the edge of the screen, the dead sprite wraps to the other side of the screen as it flies away from whatever killed him.

(Plus there's big gaping holes where the rest of the game needs to go.) If you do make a map, I'd love to see how you map out the void zone, though. It's not exactly linear.

I just checked the trailer the other day and it was a real head-turner, with that weird costume of yours and all.<br /><br />I'll be checking out the demo in a minute, but judging by just your trailer, the graphics are OK. The character animations are reasonably smooth and the screen transitions look great, but your maps look awfully bleak. Are you planning to go back and add in more background details at any point? I mean, even some flat 1bpp walls would be just fine.<br /><br />If you'd like, I could draw some graphics for you. I've been going through a bit of an NES-phase lately and can PM you some examples of my work if you want.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />Whoa, I just played the demo and let me say...I'm thoroughly impressed! The controls are fluid, the atmosphere set by the music is fantastic and the game is very intuitive. The game has a nice single-screen C64 feel to it, but those restrictions never feel like they're holding the game back. My favorite lizard was definitely the spring-boots one!

I did find a couple of the secret spots, but not all of them (if the footage is all from the demo).
