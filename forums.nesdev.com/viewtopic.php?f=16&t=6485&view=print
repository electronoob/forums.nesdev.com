		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm getting a little bit fed up with the re-captcha plug-in since it only make our life miserable while the human spammers can still post their link...
<br />
<br />For now, the usefulness of this thing is 0% since it didn't block anything. So instead of making everyone suffer, I'm thinking about adding a new security level: creating a trusted group.
<br />
<br />What this mean is anybody can create an account but as long as you are in the normal user group: you cannot do anything.  Basically I want to add an approval system.  We don't approve the user right away and once we know who it is, we add the user in the trusted group.
<br />
<br />Names that sound fishy will never be approved unless that person comes on nesdev to explain his/her case.
<br />
<br />Our community is so small that I see no problem with it.  Anybody have any objection? I know Tepples will have some but I just want to shutdown the door to spammers, that's it. I don't mind to do the extra management since the number of users added to the wiki is low so it's quite a simple task to do.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Heh, I was just thinking of this very same thing. I've been posting a lot of test ROM links lately and am getting a little tired of the CAPTCHA as well. But I figured it's there in case my account gets compromised or something, though I guess that's a pretty remote possibility. One thing that's annoyed me is that the "This is a minor edit" checkbox reverts to its default value when the CAPTCHA comes up.
<br />
<br />I have no objection. As you say, this is a small group. Looking at the change log, it seems you admis spend significant time cleaning out spam that this would eliminate completely.

"Told ya!"  :P  This is basically the only way the Whirlpool/Donut forum was able to deal with spammers as well -- their board was read-only for everyone, and only people with registered accounts could post.  (To get an account you had to Email the board maintainers, who would give you your own unique login/password)
<br />
<br />I have absolutely no objection to your proposal.  Thumbs up.

<br />
<br />The main goal of the captcha was to stop automated spam. The problem is all the spammers were human so there is no value in that plug-in.
<br />
<br />Then I will go with the trusted group since it's the easiest to manage (no plugin, etc).
<br />
<br />You must now welcome your new Wiki spam "tyrant". <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
