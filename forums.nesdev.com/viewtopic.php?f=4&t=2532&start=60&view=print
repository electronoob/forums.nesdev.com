<br />
<br />I like the idea of using fast SRAM for DMA as well. Too bad PRG ROM (and internal VRAM) is so slow..

It looks like the 18F ones being made with the PMP are also standard Flash (rather than the enhanced Flash like the 18F4525).  But with them all being fine-pitched parts, as much as I'd like having more I/O pins, I'm not too excited about soldering a bunch of those.

<br />The microprocessor is most certainly the same, only the code will differ.
<br />Then, you could include a code that tries all regions, and switch to another if the NES CIC doesn't seem to answer correctly to a given region. This will do an universal CIC that will work with all NES ever made, including those with modern "secured CICs" and with no CICs at all.

<br />I just figured it would be a pain to get something possible both with the pinout of the CIC and the pinout of anyother MCU out there. Pins 1, 2 and 3 must definitely be input ports, pin 4 could be VSS (since it's grounded anyway for CICs on the cart) and then any MCU coming in a DIP8 package with ground pin on pin 4 and VCC pin on pin 8 could do. Clock input and reset could be ported to pins 5-7 that are not connected to the CIC (or grounded).
<br />The problem is that the DIP8 pics available have a totally different and annoying pinout, I haven't figured if there were any other MCU in DIP8 package.
<br />
<br />EDIT : Here you are the final version of a universal cart with a real CIC and CIC defeater PIC10F DIP8 based MCU.
<br />Notice : PIC10F must be placed in the other polarity than the CIC, and one slot backwards. I know it's not too good looking, but the best I've found.

<br />Also is the CIC reset active high or low ? If it's active high an inverter should be added before pin 5, because PIC's reset is active low. This could be done with a 74HC04, 74HC14 or a comparator easily.

<br />
<br />However, I think just a simple very small coprocessor (simple PIC maybe?) where you can put a small code in there that emulates the mapper you want (such that it can emulate most of the common mappers used in homebrew). In this case, a new iNES mapper number should be added for this, and then any variation of the mapper you make up for this can also be emulated in NES emulators on computer loaded from a .NES file (and that a (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software" class="postlink">Free</a>) program can be written to transfer a .NES file to the cartridge and vice versa)
