						<div class="postbody">Nintendo is of course a corporate business, meaning that their main goal is to make money. Nintendo needs customers, though customers do not necessarily need Nintendo. This is one reason why Nintendo differs so much depending on the region. In my opinion, I feel Nintendo of Japan is much cooler and reasonable compared to its American counterpart. In this read, we'll examine some key aspects.<br /><br />1) Nintendo of Japan was more 'real'. Let's face it. No matter who we are or where we live, we will ALL eventually be exposed to sex, drugs, religious acts of some kind and violence/cursing. Nintendo of Japan is more hardcore in this aspect in that these petty little things don't matter to them. I've personally translated Pokemon Green (on the hacking sub-forum category; I've got a new build to post, too). One thing is that they removed the drunk man scene, as well as mentions of &quot;heaven&quot; and even the mention of &quot;Kanto&quot;. Some of the other text scenes that they cut were beyond me as there seemed to be nothing wrong, IMO, like the Mew diaries being changed. Zelda I omitted the word 'Bible' etc. The list for this goes on.<br /><br />2) Japan is the true headquarters of Nintendo, so they get content first as well as fuller content. I think of giveaways like the Mew giveaway and Celebi event (we never even had a chance for the Celebi event...I had to hack it back into Crystal). I also think of the female trainer sprites in G/S that were changed to have pants rather than shorts. Seriously, wtf Nintendo of America? Two inches longer??? What the hell difference did that make? They weren't exposed to begin with. They got fuller better content like the FDS. The bottom of NOA NES' had extension ports but we never got an add-on... The FDS had an extra sound channel and games we never even got. Heck, the FDS library is HUGE (as well as Famicom). Games like SMB2J, Doki Doki Panic in its full, Deep Dungeon etc. We really got screwed. Don't even get me started on the Pokemon Cards. In the TCG GBC game we got a promo Meowth card packaged but Japan got the legendary Dragonite holo card... the rarest freakin' card in the game as a REAL card??? Seriously? Plus their expansions were so much fuller, Gym Challenge had more cards (they omitted a naked Misty that wasn't even visible), Fossil had Mew, Neo 2 and 3 had holos we never got, promos we never even got, unreleased cards...full sets like the vending series. Anime of Pokemon was censored/omittted entirely. Nintendo could have done better when coming to the States.<br /><br />3) Nintendo of Japan is really more sincere. NOA has communication issues. Think about it. All the main games are created there with people like Shigeru Miyamoto. Where the originality stays fresh. When they come to the States, we get watered down versions by corporate and poorly translated/mistranslated games. The problem with Nintendo of America: They try too hard. Plain and simple. It's all about the money and its always been that way because this is business. But there's a point when people get too greedy and fear lurks around corner with people afraid to release things because of fear of bad sales. So some duche idiots with no sense of creativity come and change it the way THEY feel it should be. Did you also know that when Pokemon first came here they wanted to change the monsters COMPLETELY because they looked to 'scary' but Nintendo of Japan said no? Censoring crap unnecessarily and cutting content. I mean, do they realize that youths today are already exposed to garbage daily in real life and good shows like Family Guy etc. No wonder Sony and Xbox are so successful; they keep it REAL! I understand wanting 'family' content but to what extent? It wasn't that bad to begin with... I think had they been more true to their products they would have been a lot more successful here in the States.<br /><br />Bottom line: Nintendo of Japan is better. Nintendo of America made bad choices and are a little too greedy for money; NOA has good businessmen but they lack creativity (and integrity).<br /><br />EDIT: Example of lack of integrity: Pokemon cards in Japan are cheaper but use a higher quality gloss paper; a box comes with 60 packs whereas our box comes with 36. They 'expand' our sets to include non-holo versions of cards to milk us out of more money because we are supposedly richer than the Japanese. In Japan, EVERY SINGLE BOOSTER PACK came with a holo. (Some like Gym Heroes came with BOTH a holo and a rare.)</div>

It'd seem the former but I'm not sure of the point you're trying to make.</div><br /><br />Well, the 80's and 90's era (the era when I was a boy). I guess anywhere before 2007 is valid within my statements. Nowadays, Nintendo is generally more linear and equitable with their releases though some can still be applied to this day. But I'm old school so I still 'live' in that era. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />The point is, it's good to put my feelings into words for a franchise I'm a fan of as well as share my childhood with. But to this day it also pisses me off to all the missed content and rip-off scams. To me, gaming was better back then as far as re-playability and originality goes. Pokemon today is insane, with so many monsters that it's a joke (you can see that they're running out of valid ideas for them but are still trying to milk the cash from a younger generation). Mario/Kirby/DK/Zelda/Metroid were all original and simplistic in their earlier days.<br /><br />For me, simplicity is better and more relaxing than what we have today. Though it is only sensible for a company to expand/grow and evolve into something more complex (which can be a plus for sales in franchise).</div>

Even the Famicom seems sublime to the NES. One reason is that it had a mic, which could be used in games like Zelda I to defeat Pols Voice. We never got that. Also, I can see why we didn't get an FDS. The FDS hardware is somewhat unstable; such as belt issues, RAM adapter issues, disks wearing out with moderate play etc. Nintendo probably didn't release it elsewhere for fear of bad sales (instead of making an effort to put QUALITY material into it for an international release). <br /><br />I like Pokemon Green and Red Japan and translated it in GB section. That I didn't mind so much not getting here in the States. The most unforgiving thing I could think of is the unrelease of SMB2J. I love that game and even broke 1 NES Remix 2 record of it. I learned 6502 for the sole purpose of hacking it (found in Homebrews section).  Howard Lincoln will always be frowned upon for his bad decisions in my eyes.<br /><br />I wish I could share my views with Nintendo about how I feel their future releases should have better hardware and more consistent releases with games. But they wouldn't care what one person has to say. All they care about is that they make good sales. The issue was that Wii U could have done better with hardware (3DS XL, too; this 2DS is a joke and the newer 3DS XL with a second circle D-pad and a slightly faster CPU [December release in Japan] is a freakin' joke). But because Nintendo chose the cheap and greedy way, they are paying for it with less sales compared to Microsoft and Sony. They WILL reap what they sow.</div>

I expect a similar deal with the next hardware iteration after the New 3DS, wherein they strip DS compatibility. I doubt they'd release their next generation handheld and have it be directly incompatible with 3DS and New 3DS software; they'd wait before pulling it, if they'd need to pull it at all (hopefully they can make it so that software can just transfer over, not likely, but I like to dream).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">OneCrudeDude wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Nintendo needs to make more powerful hardware and advertise their consoles better (though Sony will always be the king of hype), and then maybe they will have some third party support, provided they don't make Crystal Chronicles/Persona Q/Twin Snakes level games.<br /></div><br /><br />What's wrong with MGS:TTS?

In part, it's a move to drive profits, but it's also a move to appeal to gamers who were interested in ultaportable handhelds, or at least found it appealing. It's a matter of covering their bases, trying to get the GBA everywhere. For what it's worth, they probably needed to move as many GBAs as they could to help out with the GC. They even managed to cobble together the GBA underneath the GC.<br /><br />Having said that, I never bought a Micro. I thought it was pointless (for me at least) but Nintendo obviously thought it could make them money while satisfying a niche, which apparently it did, or at least it had its time. Though players could have easily pocketed that cash and save up for a DS, which would have played GBA games and DS games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ShaneM wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Nintendo, in my opinion, is trying to milk its customers of money by releasing nonsense.<br /></div><br /><br />It's not just hardware, keep in mind, they will try to sell you the same software twice over. Half of my Virtual Console titles are games I already own, but I liked having my Wii do all of the work instead of futzing around with 2 or 3 separate consoles (in the end I just made a mini PC dedicated to console emulation, but that's a different tale). I have a feeling Nintendo knows about people like me, so VC's are good revenue for them.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ShaneM wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">They were probably out of ideas so they release a newer build a few months later with few upgrades and sell it as a new console.

Without that, it'd just be typical Nintendo behavior gradually &quot;improving&quot; their handheld over time until they bring in a new generation entirely. The New 3DS is quite unlike any other mid-generation hardware iteration Nintendo has done for their portables. It brings in new input, and potentially fragments game support (more than the GBC? we'll see).<br /><br />Putting that aside, the thing is, the 3DS 3+ years old at this point. It's just Nintendo's cycle. They start with one model of the portable, then keep making changes. It's &quot;about that time&quot; for another 3DS, like it or not; it's been their strategy ever since the original GB got a Pocket version. It's in their corporate DNA by now.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ShaneM wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Nintendo is ripping us off with these cheap gimmicks.

I groaned about it; I just wanted fancy polygons on the go. I kinda felt the same way about the DS (dual-screens? touch input?) but that actually worked since developers took advantage of that quite nicely in a number of games. I share your pain to some extent. I have gripes about the 2DS as well; I think it's perfectly pointless product. It's aesthetically unappealing (Tiger Electronics says hi) and ergonomically offensive. It's cheaper by an insignificant amount. And the kicker is that regular 3DS units already have the ability via parental control to disable the 3D, or they could just super-glue the 3D slider if they're that desperate.</div>

It's aesthetically unappealing (Tiger Electronics says hi) and ergonomically offensive. It's cheaper by an insignificant amount. And the kicker is that regular 3DS units already have the ability via parental control to disable the 3D, or they could just super-glue the 3D slider if they're that desperate.</div><br /><br />The problem is that we have a very large, gullible segment of the gaming population. The issue is, Nintendo is able to work their cheap &quot;magic&quot; by getting into the minds of children to make profit (since children are easier to work with). (I'm sure this applies to Japan, too. But I live in America and I can only speak for my part of the world.)<br /><br />I recently saw earlier this year a commercial for the Zelda and Mario Wii U deluxe where there were kids in front of the TV...thinking of ways to get their <em>parents</em> to buy something. Whenever there is a new build or even a promotion, Nintendo takes advantage of the children because they know that's how they'll get the money. Parents don't know half the time what they're getting. I work in the electronics department at Meijer's and I can tell you some of the ridiculous things kids tell their parents about it. Nintendo knows that children can exaggerate and twist the truth to make things sound better, so they advertise 'facts' about the newer builds and then wait for the children to twist the truth because most parents love their children and buy them things as rewards/etc.<br /><br />Nintendo is worse than PS/XBOX when it comes to being morally ethical. Even though these parties sell more adult-oriented games, they are at least somewhat more honest. What I'm saying may sound like a lot of implied opinions, but I am a very observational person and have deduced these facts from my given ability to reason. --ShaneM</div>

A great many industries advertize to kids and for kids. If they can convince the kid on their product (fairly or unfairly), then they will. Nintendo isn't the only offender in this arena. It's probably something that can be tied to modern consumerism if anything. I mean, my friends and I were like that for just about everything game related. Any console that was new, it was on our &quot;gotta have it, need it&quot; list, and between the lot of us, at least one of my friends had one of every console when we were growing up, always from begging our parents. <br /><br />I guess we see less advertizing aimed at kids from Sony and MS simply because they don't really have the whole &quot;Family&quot; label that Nintendo dominates, unless you're the kind of family gets around the TV to play CoD, or Assassin's Creed, or the like. Nintendo's always been a kind of &quot;all ages&quot; console maker, bending towards younger players though. I suppose it's going to be inevitable that their marketing targets impressionable youths.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ShaneM wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Nintendo is worse than PS/XBOX when it comes to being morally ethical.<br /></div><br /><br />From their perspective, they really don't need to. They're a business after all. As long as their PR remains good, and as long as their products sell, the considerations raised in this thread will likely continue to go on unaddressed. And apparently it takes a lot to flounder your PR with gamers, given all the things in the past few years that both Sony and MS have done themselves.</div>

Some revisions integrated the Z80 into the ASIC, but it was still usable there in the end, and as far as I know model 2 still can play Master System games (model 3 technically can as well but the relevant line isn't connected in the cartridge slot).<br /><br />Model 2 pretty much just removed the headphone jack and the third I/O port (which was used only by the modem, which was a massive flop so it never made its way outside Japan), while also exposing the raw RGB signals (!!). Model 3 didn't get rid of the Reset button =| Expansion port is removed though, and some of the things the 32X needs aren't connected (but you can fix this one). Most of the incompatibilities actually arise from bugfixes (the vertical scroll bug is fixed so Kawasaki Superbike Challenge overcorrects the leftmost column, the TAS instruction now works which makes Gargolyes crash as it expects it to not work, etc.)<br /><br />But yes, ultimately those revisions were pretty much equivalent to today's &quot;slim&quot; consoles. They're just revisions meant to reduce manufacturing costs. (in fact, model 2 was smaller than model 1, and model 3 was even smaller than those two)</div>
