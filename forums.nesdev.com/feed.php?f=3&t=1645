sevast: Yes, the game is very gimmicky, not all that fun, and the Uforce performs at it's typical low standards.  I don't want to see it emulated because it's a fun game, though, I want it emulated because there's really no other way that the general public will be able to play this game.<br /><br />pragma: Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but for this game, you'd have to do more than just map the keys into a "Uforce layout."  You can't get any response in this game, on a real system or in an emulator, using the regular controller.  I don't know what it is, but there's something unique about the Uforce that makes it impossible to play this game without it.  I like your idea of a seperate "Uforce window," but you're right, some of the games on this cart require you to use two hands.<br /><br />I spoke with rbudrick about this a little while back, and he suggested skipping emulation all together and creating a way to connect a real Uforce directly to the PC.  It's a good idea, but I'd prefer emulation, if possible, since the number of Uforce owners out there is pretty limited.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=635">Skrybe</a> — Mon Jun 12, 2006 11:23 am</p><hr />

The principle of operation was simple: IR leds and IR photosensors that make a complete switch when something gets close enough.  Yet despite that, it failed to deliver because it just wasn't sensitive enough.  Also the small area of reception on the device made games like punch-out nowhere near as fun to play as they should have been.<br /><br />Anyway, as far as emulation goes, I really only see two possiblities:<br /><br />- allow for multiple keyboard profiles in the emulator, so one can use a more 'u-force style' layout - something where the controller keys are mapped at the corners of the keyboard for example.<br /><br />- spawn a second window for the emulator (yea, can't do this fullscreen) that shows a uforce shaped interface area that is sensitive to mouse clicks.  This presents a few more problems as I think as some of the modes (remember the four mode switches on the device?) assumed that the user had use of two hands.<br /><br />Outside that, it really falls into a "why bother" kind of category since the whole point behind the u-force is to provide a 3D touchless interface.  You just can't emulate that unless you have a 3D mouse or glove at your disposal. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=273">pragma</a> — Mon Jun 12, 2006 10:04 am</p><hr />

From what I've seen, the game is not very amazing at all.  It may have some gimmick appeal to it when played with a uforce, but would you actually want to play it with a keyboard?  For me it's like the fact that duck hunt is fun with the zapper for a while.  I wouldn't want to play the game with a mouse.  If you take the gimmick away, there's no fun.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the uforce never seemed to work.  Does it actually work with the game?<br /><br />I don't mean to sound like I'm telling you that your idea just sucks.  I am glad that someone has a backup of the game now and it will be able to be preserved for history.  It would be cool to see it emulated for posterity.  I just don't know how much excitement the idea with generate.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=231">sevast</a> — Sun Jun 11, 2006 9:07 pm</p><hr />
