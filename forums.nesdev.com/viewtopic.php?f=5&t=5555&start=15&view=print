		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm noting that the Case's PSU is 330W common with only 1 identified rail. When working with "Modernized" CPU's I found it's best practice to get multiple +12v rails...That way your power can be more "evenly" distributed, and not have one device stressing the others because they share voltages.
<br />
<br />If you are going with exactly that, somthing in the $40 range from Antec, BFG, or Cooler Master has seem to provide me with positive results consistently.
<br />
<br />Here's some examples:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371005" class="postlink">Antec EarthWatts EA-380</a>

<br /><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817171046" class="postlink">Cooler Master Elite 460</a>
<br />
<br />Couldn't Find a cheap BFG Tech PSU on Newegg, Sorry.

<br />
<br />For my latest PC's case I mostly wanted one that was really quiet.  I kinda wanted a clear one, but I figure I hear it more often than I look at it.  I went with the Antec P182 (appears "deactivated" on newegg) and it is nearly silent.
<br />
<br />For the thermal compound, if there's any already attached the CPU, I wouldn't bother.  It could also possibly void the warranty.

<br />
<br />I tend to stick to Crucial memory because it has a lifetime warranty, and it's absolutely guaranteed to work with the board you pick.
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts.aspx?model=M4A785TD-V%20EVO">http://www.crucial.com/store/listparts. ... TD-V%20EVO</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I can't comment on the CPU or motherboard because I don't buy AMD stuff.
<br />
<br />Get whatever case suits your needs.  I tend to lean towards Supermicro cases, but they're expensive.  For generic workstations, I lean towards Antec.
<br />
<br />PSU-wise, I tend to stick to Antec stuff, but there's compatibility problems in some situations.  I speak from experience...
<br />
<br />Otherwise -- and I say this seriously -- consider just buying a pre-made workstation from Dell.  They're of surprisingly good quality (referring to their XPS systems, and not the decked-out gaming rigs which cost amounts only parents with snot-nosed unemployed kids could afford...), excellent cable runs, etc...
<br />
<br />I'm getting to the age where I'm considering just buying pre-made workstations, even though I usually end up buying individual parts.  I buy (mostly) pre-made servers, sans RAM + CPU + disks...

Mouse still sucks though. 
<br />
<br />I should be able to do all the modern stuff with this.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />edit:maybe not a great idea for a case, the side fan is unnessasery and a little noisy so I just dont plug it in. Also installing this horrible update to IE still makes the screen fuzzy and its layout is awfull. I have no idea why microsoft is so dead set on destroying the usefullness of there browser

<br />
<br />Possibly by the "update" you're referring to IE8, by which ClearType text is enabled by default in the browser for all HTML?  (I use LCDs exclusively and I turn it off, because I think ClearType looks like complete garbage.  Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Advanced tab -&gt; Multimedia section of Settings -&gt; Uncheck "Always use ClearType for HTML").

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So that's what it is, another retarded Microsoft thing that dose not work. Thanks for the info. Everyone has been so helpful I am now having a new problem.
<br />
<br />I have 3 computers connected to a home network, they all connect through a router, one of them is wireless the other 2 are wired. All 3 where working fine for a wile but now I am having trouble with one of the wired ones.
<br />
<br />The computer can access files off the other 2 computers just fine but try to access files off the computer from one of the outer computers and it wont work. When you try to run a home network wizard it gives you an error when it tries to configure the network. So any ideas how to fix this, I assume something must be corrupted someplace. I was having some PSU issues, it may or may not have stared after it lost power a bunch of times (this is my old computer)
<br />
<br />Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.
