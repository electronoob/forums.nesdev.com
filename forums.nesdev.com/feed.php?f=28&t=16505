It should work for Famicom game boards made by Nintendo. Third-party boards, by contrast, are more likely to use an EEPROM-compatible pinout for their mask ROMs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Sep 18, 2017 4:04 pm</p><hr />
