(really the only reason I ever downloaded it was because its PC Engine emulator at least can scroll the screen in Nectaris while the one I was using before couldn't, otherwise I wouldn't have even looked at it)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Only a handful of Mednafen's cores are actually original (and some of the code for a few was based on existing code/designs, whatever the truly means). NES emulation is provided by FCEU, though I'm not entirely sure which version it currently uses. It's probably not hardware-accurate, but &quot;accurate&quot; enough as far as ordinary users care about, else I think they'd be hard pressed to use something better, or make something better.<br /><br />About FCEUX not truly being multiplatform, it's been ages since I even touched the Windows version, but aside from the missing debugger, I can't think of any major features that are lacking, at least none that are deal-breakers for an average player like myself. There probably are some advanced bells and whistles that I've never touched (please point them out, since I'm really curious to find out the Windows/Linux differences), but I'm guessing FCEUX is in the same boat as VBA-M and Desmume. They have Linux ports to be sure (I use them, a lot :p) but they're missing a lot of the debugging features present on the Windows version. To my knowledge, this is simply due to the fact that no one has bothered to add things to the Linux GUIs. It often gets put on the back-burner, which means indefinite delay.

Does it even run on a PowerPak?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Myask - That's the point I was making. For your average user, the FCEUX port is complete enough. It's those extra features that are actually pretty niche even as far as emulation goes (TAS and debugging). Most people involved in emulation just want to play games (myself included as it regards the NES).<br /><br />But you missed the other point I was making. There's nothing, to my knowledge, that prevents those features from being added to the SDL/GTK+ version. Most of the debugger is probably just a matter of writing the necessary GUI code (again, as in the cases of other emulators such as VBA-M and Desmume). Video recording may be trickier (dumping audio in SDL is straightforward) but not impossible (just hit up ffmpeg if need be). I doubt there's a lot that can't be ported (or much of anything really). It's just a matter of not enough people caring to get the work done, not that the work can't be done.
