<br />
<br />This isn't like an open call that I will do art for anybody's NES game, although I might depending on what it is.  I don't have any delusions of being a totally awesome pro or anything, it's just part of the hobby. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Pixel art:

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, some pretty nice stuff here! I like the detailed animation of the black mage <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> !
<br />
<br />I seem to recall the guy in the 7th picture on the right being discussed in the thread about the fighting game, am I correct? It looks really nice, and the shading is really sharp. You could easily scale that down to only 3 colors (I think I see 4 in the skin tone, and some more for the eyes. Perhaps I'm wrong?).
<br />
<br />And for the one right below that for the background with the rocks, I agree that the background is way too busy. My recommendation would be to darken it down so it looks more like emptiness with something in the distant background. The way it is now, I have trouble telling if it is side scrolling or top-down (the wall almost looks like a floor). Otherwise, the rock pattern looks pretty nice, and the background wall looks good it just needs color adjustment (in my opinion, at least).
<br />
<br />And the stuff below that is pretty cool too. I'm curious, how did you color the last one? Is that photoshop, or was it actually colored on paper?
<br />
<br />As for some of my work, here are just some things I've posted in other threads:
<br />
<br />Some pretty big portraits for my NES game (actual segment of a screen print of FCEUXD):
<br />
<br />Main character:
<br /><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v287/I_am_Roth/web_examples/portrait.gif" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />I think the mouth needs a little work, because with the limited pixel space it makes the player look like he might be making a stupid face... I still think it looks coolish, kinda. The sprites of that character:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/CeliusNESModels.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />It's hard to tell where what ends because the player is actually made with a black outline and black in other spots. It's just against a black background so it's hard to tell...
<br />
<br />For the other character, here is the NES portrait and real portrait:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://the_bott.webs.com/NESPaint.JPG" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />And here's a link to the real pic so it doesn't make you scroll over and crap:
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://the_bott.webs.com/Leah_Scan.jpg">http://the_bott.webs.com/Leah_Scan.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />It's not that great of a painting, but I like the nintendoization of it a lot.
<br />
<br />That's basically all I have for now. Nothing that special, but decent I think.

<br />
<br />Just Photoshop.
<br />
<br />I like your portraits too, they remind me of NES FF2 portraits.  And the sprite looks very much like it would fit in a modern Castlevania.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Haha! It's funny you say the sprites remind you of modern day castlevania, because they're for my game "ChateauLeVania", which is basically going to play just like modern day castlevanias. The portraits are much bigger than FF2 portraits, however. They're about 64x96 pixels, I believe. That's like 1/3 of the screen tall! There's a lot of sprite layering that happens there too, so it's a pretty complex image to display.
<br />
<br />Are you sure you -need- an extra sprite for the eyes of your guy? It seems like you might be able to find a solution with your current palette for the rest of the body. It might really save you to not have to depend on two of the palettes remaining constant.
<br />
<br />About your rock tiles, I really think the second one looks best. You've got a nice variety of color going on (or the illusion of variety with dithering), and it doesn't look as cartoony as the last one does. It's very nice shading.

<br />I don't think this is the problem (being busy), I just think that there isn't enough contrast between the rocks and the blocks. If the blocks were darker it would probably look much better.

<br />Tokumaru is sounds like you are actually a lot better at drawing that what I was suspecting. You really shouldn't have anything to worry about art in your games.
<br />
<br />As for myself you can see art by me on my very outdated website (will upload it when I'll be done with the exams I guess).

I somehow skipped over looking at your page, but I have to say I'm impressed with how well you've maintained all those sprites even when scaling them down to ridiculous dimensions. I can't imagine trying to scale Zelda II sprites to be 8x16 pixels! What's even better, I didn't even have to read the text to see what sprites were from what games. That's hard to make someone do with sprites so small. Good job!
