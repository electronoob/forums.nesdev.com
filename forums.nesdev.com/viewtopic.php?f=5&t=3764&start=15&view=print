<br />He's talking about taking two totally different gaming engines and combining them. One is a top down RPG and the other is a first-person Eye of the Beholder style game. Unless he means using both styles of play (birds-eye-view for map and then first-person for indoors) then no way. Super Mario All-Stars does utilize this kind of thing (birds-eye for map, platform for levels), but it depends on what he means.

He didn't say he wish to have two game on one cart, he says he wants to combine the two ROM images. You cannot just take one byte of one game, one byte of the other, repeat until you got every byte of every game taken along, and get a third game. That's something this guy seems to think like possible reading his post.

<br />
<br />except have the game engine from either Arcana of Eye of the Beholder mix with the Mystic Quest engine in order to seamlessly switch between the two engines, as a single game.
<br />
<br />yes i realize EotB and MQ are both SNES games, however i recall Arcana was originally released for NES, iirc, from walk-thrus in Nintendo Power.
<br />
<br />MQ is basically on par with a NES game, just with special effects only doable on the SNES, with slightly improved range of colors.
<br />
<br />meaning cloning it for NES using a high-level compiler will be easy cake.
<br />
<br />also since Arcana was originally a NES game, comparing the NES and SNES arcana carts would lead insight in how to high-level clone the Eye of the Beholder engine which is extremely similar to Arcana to NES.
<br />
<br />since high-level code is easy to combine with other high-level code,
<br />
<br />it will be much easier to recompile these *cloned* engines as a single multiple point of view engine.
<br />
<br />by this i mean you can see Arcana/EotB's view first person in the hud while viewing MQ's 45 degree top/front top-down main screen and vice versa by choosing to swap the HUD behavior and main screen behavior.
<br />
<br />if nBasic won't cut it, and can't find a c compiler for NES, i will be forced to make this an extremely long term project by making my own c compiler for NES based off the LADS 6502 compiler, of which i have the machine coce source for.
<br />
<br />btw i plan to modify the MQ 45 degree top/front top-down method so that you can press a button to align the 90 interval of map rendering from front to either side or rear.

The graphics, gameplay, music, overworld map, and pretty much everything else are all sub-par compared to SNES version. This port is also considered a rather phenomenal effort, and with good reason.
<br />
<br />One of the main special effects that the SNES enabled was enhanced flashiness. Controls, colors, visual effects, music, and graphical complexity. You can't do on an NES what you can do on an SNES for the simple fact that both the CPU and the memory viewable in an NES game aren't enough to contain and process the elements of SNES games that you take for granted after you've played 50 SNES games. Sure, Mystic Quest could be simulated using another FF engine and a lot of leg-work with the raw assembly, but you can't take what's in MQ and port it directly to the NES, because even the enemy stat table would likely span 2 banks of data by itself. Then there's the amount of text to deal with, and you can ask some translation people about how wonderful they thought it was when they learned how to expand games for more text space. All the maps would take up a good bit of room too, and then stuff like map objects(placement, type, subtype, H-position X, V-position Y, possibly layer Z) would take up even more. Add to that the specialized ASM(climbing walls, chopping trees, hooking on stuff, screen shakes, object macros) and additional menus to make up for missing controller buttons and you're racking up a lot of time and space, and that's just on the Mystic Quest side.
<br />
<br />With that in place, the best case scenario is you stealing someone else's coding for the side-scroller, and trying to make it not interfere with the 0x6C0 area of memory you have to work with for 2 games worth of info (leaving 0x40 for the stack).
<br />
<br />After all of this, you end up with a huge, choppy, SFX-free, probably-incomplete game that's been done.
<br />
<br />Your best bet: Do what other people do. Find a game with a system close to what you want, and hack in the story and gameplay you want it to have.

<br />
<br />What is closest happens to be the Arcana cart released for both NES and SNES, the similar Eye of the Beholder cart released for both SNES and PC, and the SNES cart Mystic Quest which was designed the way a NES game is that simply made use of all the bells and whistles of SNES.
<br />
<br />This provides two unique machine code signatures for Arcana,
<br />two unique machine code signatures for Eye of the Beholder,
<br />and the intuitive to reverse engineer Mystic Quest machine code.
<br />
<br />Since the Arcana and Eye of the Beholder games were coded to behave perceptually identical between each platform they were released for, the machine code images from each platform is easy to cross reference via branch mapping.
<br />
<br />If you are unfamiliar with the concept of branch mapping, a famous legal case involving branch mapping forensic evidence being put to use was when IBM lost its legal case against COMPAQ, in which IBM claimed COMPAQ ripped off their Bios. The forensic evidence proved that the branch map of COMPAQ's Bios and the branch map of IBM's Bios, did not hold any common relationship.
<br />
<br />Another famous legal case was when PearPC won its legal case against CherryOS, in which the branch mapping of CherryOS was virtually identical to that of PearPC. However, other evidence such as vector names  unique and proprietary to PearPC also occuring in CherryOS were extra evidence in winning the lawsuit that the PearPC developer filed against the  distributors and developers of CherryOS.
<br />
<br />One major reason that I intend to clone as a hybrid engine rather that gut a native existing engine, is so that, if in the future, if i do indeed intend to retail the game Puzzlum : Realm of Existence for NES, I am immune to any legal action simply due to the reasoning behind the outcome of those two court battles.

<br />
<br />There exist C compilers for the 6502 for Commodore Pet 4016 model 'N'.
<br />
<br />The 4016 comes standard with 16 kilobytes of RAM. Only 12 of which is maximally allotted to machine code programs. (PET Basic 4.0 normally allots only 4 kilobytes of variable space RAM by default for PET ROM version 4 on the PET 4016N.)
<br />
<br />There also exist PET Basic 4.0 compilers for the PET 4016N, which unlocks 12 kilobytes of random access memory by default. I see not how such could not be created for the NES, as already done with the middle-level nBASIC which makes use of the NESasm compiler.
<br />
<br />I intend to fully make use of JIT (Just In Time) compilation with a C pre-compiler of my own tweaks via the machine code assembler NESasm. This would allow me to do the equivalent of user-definable DukeScript-style code with the game.
<br />
<br />I also plan on making use of such high-level concepts such as fully automated garbage collection, vectors, associative arrays, class inheritance, and multi-dimensional memory banks. This last paragraph is small-fry stuff for my level of experience with programming of custom engines and SDKs from scratch or near scratch within the strict confines of limited RAM and processor speed.

<br />
<br />- High level programming is just TOO ineficient when it comes to ROM and RAM memory to be suitable for the NES. The NES has 2 KB RAM, and 32 KB ROM (more if you do bankswitching that no high-level language I know have provisions for). You can try to make a C compiler for the NES, I won't retain you. In fact it could be great, but I've heard someone already tried the CC65 compiler for the 6502 (wich is so compatible with the NES), but got deplorable results.
<br />
<br />- You could of course disassemble and fully reverse engineer a commercial game like Final Fantasy MQ, port it's game engine core on the NES without too much problems by rewriting the routines on the 6502 instead. Since the game does't use SNES features such as mode 7 for gameplay and the controls could most likely be modified to fit the inferior NES controls, you could dratiscally put the graphics down and make a NES port of FFMQ. However, that'd be probably arround a thousand of hours of work, maybe more, and you'll end up with a completely useless result almost nobody will be interested for.
<br />
<br />- Reverse engineering an existing game gives you hard to undersand without any comment assembly code, NOT ready to use high level code, no matter on what system.
<br />
<br />- If you want to make a game, you have to use your own game engine for copiright, moral, and pragmatic reasons. Also you cannot just port a console game engine from one system to another, since a console is an embeeded system, unless the game engine was written with that in mind (probably earasing code optimisation).
<br />
<br />What you say just make absolutely no sense.

Hell, Microsoft's first BASIC Interpreter for the Altair 8800 required at least twice the amount of RAM the will NES have had, &amp; this is back in 1975, on a more powerful CPU!!!  Of course an interpreter /= a compiler, but the point is if Bill Gates &amp; Paul Allen could only squeeze out a few lines on a printer terminal w/ much larger resources at hand, I seriously doubt you could squeeze out an entire C compiler, for a tile-based system w/ 8 buttons, on 1/2-1/3 the resources.

Sure some of the early 6502-based business PC's had compilers, but the NES doesn't have any memory close to near what they had!  Hell, Microsoft's first BASIC Interpreter for the Altair 8800 required at least twice the amount of RAM the will NES have had, &amp; this is back in 1975, on a more powerful CPU!!!  Of course an interpreter /= a compiler, but the point is if Bill Gates &amp; Paul Allen could only squeeze out a few lines on a printer terminal w/ much larger resources at hand, I seriously doubt you could squeeze out an entire C compiler, for a tile-based system w/ 8 buttons, on 1/2-1/3 the resources.</span></div>
<br />
<br />maybe you are right. but then again i don't think anyone has attempted it yet.

The NES has 2 KB RAM, and 32 KB ROM (more if you do bankswitching that no high-level language I know have provisions for). You can try to make a C compiler for the NES, I won't retain you. In fact it could be great, but I've heard someone already tried the CC65 compiler for the 6502 (wich is so compatible with the NES), but got deplorable results.</span></div><br /><br />i plan on making my game mainly bank switch with save data.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">- You could of course disassemble and fully reverse engineer a commercial game like Final Fantasy MQ, port it's game engine core on the NES without too much problems by rewriting the routines on the 6502 instead. Since the game does't use SNES features such as mode 7 for gameplay and the controls could most likely be modified to fit the inferior NES controls, you could dratiscally put the graphics down and make a NES port of FFMQ. However, that'd be probably arround a thousand of hours of work, maybe more, and you'll end up with a completely useless result almost nobody will be interested for.</span></div><br /><br />i already know how Arcana and Eye of the Beholder work enough to *reclone* their engine methods for the NES' custom 6502.<br /><br />it will not require any more reverse engineering than i have already done in order to *reclone* the Mystic Quest overworld, town, dungeon, and battle modes for the NES' custom 6502.<br /><br />i have already cloned the various engine components in the past for PC.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">- Reverse engineering an existing game gives you hard to undersand without any comment assembly code, NOT ready to use high level code, no matter on what system.</span></div><br /><br />there existed at one point a QuickBasic compiled binary decompiler back to QuickBasic, there also exist Java decompilers,<br /><br />however with both they decompile to equivalent high-level code, but all the variable/class names are enumerated rather than as the originals due to being lost after compile.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">- If you want to make a game, you have to use your own game engine for copiright, moral, and pragmatic reasons.

<br />
<br />you think i am porting machine code directly, or reverse engineering based off the machine code, i am reverse engineering based off the output. using machine code branch maps as a guide. i don't really give a crap what the actual opcodes are, i use the branch map to reverse engineer based on the output what the branches mean in order to get an idea what is going on and in what order on an abstract level.
<br />
<br />cloning means you do it this method, porting means you use the original machine code and tweak the machine code to run on a different processor set.
<br />
<br />
<br />btw i plan on using some Reverse Polish Notation bytecode as the scripting language. (this means very little overhead and ram consumption.)
