<br />
<br />Yeah, because with FAT12, fat entries are 1.5 octets (12 bits), but sectors are <em>still</em> 512 octets, so fat entries can cross sector boundaries, which can be a major pain in the butt (it forces you to fetch most of the time 2 FAT sectors). This don't happen with FAT16 of FAT32, because fat entries are 16 bits and 32 bits*.
<br />
<br />* FAT32 is really "FAT28" because only the 28 LSBs are used.

<br />
<br />How about a scheme where you allocate the next free cluster until the FAT cache runs out, then make a single random probe for the next table sector before settling in for a linear scan?
<br />
<br />Oh, and I know it sounds obvious but don't re-scan from scratch for every single allocation (Microchip, I'm looking at you..)

<br />
<br />There's also the Contiki port, defunct as it is. Theoretically, any of the OSes for 6502 based home computers could be ported, but I'm not aware of any that have been. (Most of them don't have source code available, which complicates things.)
<br />
<br />Then there's whatever the "Ten Dollar Computer" clones run. Graphically, it looks like Windows, and has mouse support, but beyond that, I don't know anything about it. Anyone know anything more about this? Has it been dumped?
<br />
<br />I've been thinking about building an NES based computer. (Basically just adding some peripherals and storage). So having some sort of OS would be nice, but I'll probably end up writing my own.
<br />
<br />As for reading FAT tables taking too long, the solution to that is simple: Use a non brain damaged filesystem instead.

<br />For one thing, as I understand it, the most popular NES to CF adapter (PowerPak) can't read anything but FAT. For another, Windows out of the box can't read and write anything but FAT, NTFS, and MTP, and for MTP, you'd have to rig up a USB to CF adapter that supports MTP and your particular file system. So what non-dain-bramaged file system would you recommend, other than creating fixed-size "disk images" within a FAT volume and reading and writing files in those?

AIUI, some of FAT's stupidity was that it needed to be usable with only the 16KB in the first IBM PC.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ext2 is probably not ideal, because it was designed for 32 bit systems. On the other hand, so was Fat32. The Minix FS wouldn't be too bad, except for the 64MB limit on filesystem size. (Which is fine on a floppy, bus silly on anything else.)
<br />
<br />Personally, if I was writing an OS for a 6502 based computer (NES based or otherwise), I would probably review what was used on '02 based home computers back in the day and either design something similar, or implement one of them (if I felt it met my needs). Of course, not using something standard means that I'd need to write an implementation on the PC side too. Which I would probably use FUSE for.
<br />
<br />Theoretically, something based on binary trees would lead to faster file access times than something based on linear block lists. So FAT is definitely not idea on a low speed system such as the NES. Filesystems optimized for eight bit systems with limited RAM probably hasn't been an active area of research lately, but I bet there where some imformative papers published during the 80s.

<br />ProDOS is based on 1:256 trees. Each file larger than 512 bytes has a key block, and each sector in the key block can point to either data sectors (up to 128 KiB) or second-level key blocks (up to 16 MiB). The directory entry states how many levels of key blocks (0, 1, or 2) are in use. There's also a "volume bitmap" immediately after the directory stating which clusters are in use, but because it's only 1 byte per sector, it's faster to read that than to read a FAT.
