<br />That is only a verification of the checksum in the header.
<br />
<br />Snes9X has a small database of checksums for known bad dumps, but that is only to stop erroneous bug reports. Last time I checked, that was only indicated by displaying the load-time status text in yellow instead of white.
<br />
<br />As mentioned above, ZSNES doesn't have perfect solutions for any of that mess. If it did, it would not be breaking Tokimeki Memorial in the name of fixing Big Sky Trooper.
<br />
<br />Snes9X doesn't even have to deal with this because it maps SRAM to both 70 and the bottom half of F0. This "just works" for Big Sky Trooper and Tokimeki, but breaks Ys3. So then it hacks Ys3 to make it work.
<br />
<br />So, without special casing, any two of those three titles can work in a given configuration. Fun, eh?

<br />
<br />The Snes9X source code also says this, in its special casing:
<br />
<br />		//not MAD-1 compliant
<br />	if(strcmp (ROMName, "WANDERERS FROM YS") == 0)
<br />	{
<br />		for(int c=0;c&lt;0xE0;c++)
<br />		{
<br />			Map[c+0x700]=(uint8*)MAP_LOROM_SRAM;
<br />			BlockIsROM[c+0x700]=FALSE;
<br />			BlockIsRAM[c+0x700]=TRUE;
<br />		}
<br />		WriteProtectROM();
<br />	}
<br />
<br />At the time when that was written, that is what the developers said. "not MAD-1 compliant", as if there were some "standard" that dictated what sort of hardware you could stick into a cartridge. There never really was anything to stop a developer from sticking whatever the hell they wanted into a cartridge, so long as it exposed reset vector to the processor and could map itself. Then, since they're so clever to be custom hardware, even if it is only slightly different from the "norm", they can write their code to break if someone tries to use a copier that doesn't support their changes. It could be as simple as a few different traces on the board, or a few extra cheap parts.

<br />
<br />So, it seems like SNES emulation really needs a systematic emulation of board types to make games work correctly.  A header would need to be added to the ROMs.  The real problem is the work involved in identifying the various boards and how they differ from each other.  As you can see with UNIF, it has taken years to adopt some of the standard and does not have the support to be a true replacement of the inferior iNES standard.

<br />
<br />Upper bits of bank select registers are ignored, so you get mirrors due to the modulo effect this has. If there are 4 PRG banks, selecting the fifth bank really selects the first one (100 AND 011 = 000). This is also how a dumper figures out how big the PRG and CHR are: keep selecting higher banks until the contents match earlier banks.

<br />
<br />The NES does not allocate any memory.  Only the 2k of RAM ($0000-07FF) and various areas of VRAM (CHR excluded) exists on the NES.  CHR-ROM, CHR-RAM, PRG, and SRAM all exist on the game cartridge... and it's all managed by cartridge hardware (PRG/CHR/SRAM are usually each on their own memory chip, for example).
<br />
<br />Unfortuntaly, ROM dumps can only contain software, not hardware... so it's up to headers to give the jist of how the hardware was layed out so the dumped software can be used appropriately.

<br />Emulator should handle this microcode or run scripts on virtual machine. All mapping work perform that running code.
<br />
<br />All roms will be as standalone cartriges, you can fix it or modify for properly working personally, no need to write all mappers support for all emulators... Many advantages...

<br />
<br />The other main problem is that this would require duplicating the same mapper code across hundreds of ROMs, and if new information was acquired about a mapper's behavior then every single one of those ROMs would have to be updated (which is largely impossible). <strong>This</strong> is why mapper logic is kept within the emulators and simply enumerated within the ROMs.
