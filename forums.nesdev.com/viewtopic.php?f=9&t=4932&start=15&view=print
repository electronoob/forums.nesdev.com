<br />No, I don't think tepples is confusing the NES with that.  He's quite right: proper shielding ***is*** required by some countries (including the United States).
<br />
<br />So the general opinion is: restore the RF shield, if not for legal ramifications, because the original system included it.  If the RF shield is damaged beyond repair, tell the owner of the original system the truth, and explain the possible (but unlikely) risks.  Seems simple enough.  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have heard that the reason for the vastly disparate amount of RF shielding on the Atari 2600 (3/32" of cast aluminum) vs the NES (1/64" of sheet metal) is because the 2600 was the widely-spread computational device and the FCC didn't know how bad the RF would be. As it turns out, 1MHz with traces that are less than 6" isn't a problem, so the FCC relaxed the shielding requirements for future computers.

<br />I'm not going to put something back that that has like 10 screws and then makes the system not work.  I'm sure I've scrapped more than 1 pin connector thinking it was defective when it was probably the RF shield pressing down on the top of the tray, making the "up" position pin connector lose contact.  I only get $10 for this mess, how bout I send them all to you and YOU mess with it for 20 minutes constantly removing and putting it back trying to get it to work again?
