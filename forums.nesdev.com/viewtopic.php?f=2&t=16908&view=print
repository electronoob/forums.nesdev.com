If so what is the different with 0-7FF RAM? Since 0-7FF RAM can be used for this too.

Writes are ignored, and reads return &quot;open bus&quot;.<br /><br />In a bunch of games, there's an 8 KiB RAM on the cart. Most of them (but not all) also have a battery to allow the RAM contents to hold save games.<br /><br />In a small handful of games, there's a smaller amount of RAM (e.g. 5 KiB, 2 KiB, or 128 B) in some smaller section of that range.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />yea it's just basically like more RAM you can use for whatever, like the 0-7FF stuff.<br /><br />I do it for both types things on megaman odyssey. i use 6000-62FF for &quot;saved game&quot; progress stuff, since i have &quot;save games&quot; not passwords.<br /><br />and 6300-7FFF is an entire level (from the ROM loaded into RAM)<br /><br />Where i can freely modify anything about a level you want, directly while your actually playing the level, like delete/add level building blocks, update palettes (more than MegaFLE originally lets you do in the megaman 3-6), etc etc<br /><br />pretty sure Rockman 4 Minus Infinity does the very same thing (loading an entire level into RAM, to modify it &quot;anytime anywhere&quot;

Since you will need to send it to the PPU anyway.<br /><br />Could you also put Odyssey on a Nes Cartdrige?

What I was meaning about PPu is that your screen you put in 6000-8000 is actually gonna be sent to the PPU somehow at some point to be drawn on screen, but nesrocks answer solve this mystery for me.
