SD card will definitely make this device really awesome. Also if Kevtris wants to add cartridge functionality I'm sure Retrode would be a good way to go. Matthias is always looking for more devs maybe the projects can help each other some how? Other wise he can just point out like most devices do that obtaining roms is something you need to do your self (via Copynes, kazzo, or Retrode) and just leave it at that.<br /><br />This maybe a stupid question but is there a thread where kevtris's progress on this device? Would love to order a couple when it's all ready.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4710">Teancum</a> — Tue May 17, 2011 12:45 pm</p><hr />

I don't think anyone is arguing that Sega made good decisions <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />You hit the nail on the head. Backwards compatibility with the previous generation is a great thing IF that previous generation is still a viable platform. Take the PS3 as a (not so good) example. It was basically released with the promise that "games will come soon, for now play your PS2 games". Not that it worked out terribly well either <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />The DS is a great example though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3706">qbradq</a> — Thu May 12, 2011 5:15 pm</p><hr />

They do, they are the same NOAC. As for "clones having it figured out" about NES &amp; SNES, they are totally separate parts unlike what Nintendo seemed to be planning to do.<br /><br />Ultimately it's a good thing Nintendo dropped the idea. It would have added unnecessary cost. Backwards compatibility is neat but I think except in the case of the Gameboy and possibly the Playstation 2, there isn't much reason or benefit to it. The Sega Genesis I think would have benefited from slashing the Master System compatibility resources and instead applying them to improving the 16bit games. Most notably by adding extra sub-palettes for games to be more colorful, and also possibly by improving the sound hardware.<br /><br />Atleast in my opinion the Master System support was not widely used or beneficial to the Genesis. I'm not really sure what the total extra costs were for Master System only components in the design. But I'm sure it wasn't free. And I've probably made this point before that the Genesis badly needed and would have benefited greatly from extra Sub-palettes for more color diversity in games. Four palettes of 16 colors is just not enough particularly when compared to 256 of the SNES and 512 of the PCE. Just by allowing Background and Sprites to use different 4 subpalettes would have raised the color count from 64 to 128 which would have been acceptable, and you could have gotten more creative and allowed BG layers A and B and Sprites to each have their own giving 192 colors potentially. Far better feature than compatibility with the system of the last generation which didn't perform well in most markets.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu May 12, 2011 4:53 pm</p><hr />
