		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I"ve made major progress on the ROM.
<br />
<br />This isn't one of those slop shoot semi change the graphics. This is going to be a total overhaul of SMB 2 to be like Doki doki panic where the good parts lie.
<br />
<br />Sou far I have changed:
<br />
<br />Grass to black. (Left it animated),
<br />
<br />Potion to lamp,
<br />
<br />Characters (Still need to work out a few things),
<br />
<br />The title on the intro screen to have the Doki doki panic kanji, and a few other things there,
<br />
<br />Shell turned to the proper mask,
<br />
<br />Mushrooms to masks,
<br />
<br />Health mushroom to a heart,
<br />
<br />Characters on the contributor screen (at the end) have their Japanese names now (Need to fix this again),
<br />
<br />Imajin's pic at the end fixed,
<br />
<br />character names at the end changed correctly to the Doki Doki panic names including Mamu.
<br />
<br />Changed the gate
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Now my problems I'm having (I hope you guys can help.)
<br />
<br />One: Luigi's legs. They kick. Where in the hex do you turn that off, and what value do you insert to do sou?
<br />
<br />Two: Lina's head seems to have a white square above it. I think it's something to do with the way I did her sprite. I may have to redo it. But it's there except if I duck, or climb with her. I've looked at all the sprites and don't see the square there anywhere. It's directly above her head, and doesn't fill the 16x16 space completely. [I think it's a sprite leak,  like how they leak white into the eyes.]
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Three: How can I make the one up sound :
<br />
<br />0x005061 - Sound a 1-up makes
<br />$8266-828D = 1UP sound
<br />0x008276 ~ 0x00829D - Sound Effect data for 1-Up grab
<br />(That's all my info on that part)
<br />
<br />Into the crystal grab music:
<br />
<br />0x009094 - Music Header for Crystal won
<br />
<br />
<br />Four: If you look at the name table when you open the rom at: 21B0,,, I want to know where that character is stored in the rom (This is for the title screen).  It's not with the rest of the characters on the main screen. I want to use it to put credit, but, it's originally a blank space on the rom, and it's not with all the other characters. I've looked, and tried everything in the vacinity.
<br />
<br />
<br />If anyone can help with any of this, I'd greatly appreciate it.
<br />
<br />I hate to bother you guys with this, but I seriously AM trying to make this rom good. 
<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Also a little info:  
<br />
<br />If you run the rom, and then open the hex editor in the program, While it's running, 1e12 Changes the tempo.
<br />
<br />The original values on speeds are:
<br />
<br />6E = Dungeon
<br />28= Outside
<br />1B= Title
<br />
<br />Sou now I need to figure out what speed is right.
<br />
<br />Doki Doki speeds are:
<br />
<br />11 = Dungeon
<br />09 = Outside
<br />00 = Title
<br />
<br />Sou they don't correspond.
<br />
<br />The dungeon is located at: 907C in a hex editor. (Not in the in game hex editor)
<br />
<br />10EC in the NSF file.
<br />
<br />0E (I think) is a very close value to Doki Doki Panic's dungeon I think.

<br />
<br />I'm using SMB 2 (Non prototype.  It's more in order than the prototype IMHO,  plus it's easier to mess with,  a lot more documentation).
<br />
<br />I'm basing it off of Doki doki panic,  Taking SMB 2,  and turning it into what it SHOULD HAVE BEEN for the re-release in America.
