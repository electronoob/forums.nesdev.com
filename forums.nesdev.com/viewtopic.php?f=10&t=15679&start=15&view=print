I can make the error screen appear by switching the setting to <strong>&lt;none&gt;</strong> and rebooting, and it recognizes the keyboard again when I set it back to <strong>Family Keyboard</strong>.<br /><br />All the hash detection does is change that setting to Family Keyboard automatically, you can do the same thing manually. I can change the file hash with a trivial edit to the ROM, and it doesn't automatically set the keyboard up when I run it (i.e. error screen) but I can still plug it in via the settings no problem.
