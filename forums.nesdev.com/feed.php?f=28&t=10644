NHL96 I think is a hi rom.  <br /><br />You need to learn about headered and non headered roms.<br /><br />Some Willem programmers can be problematic with the flash roms. <br /><br />What game are you wanting to repo?<br /><br />Edit:  ah, you want to put a socket on the cart.... The rom won't fit inside the cart shell if you use a socket.     The only exception is a flush socket which are almost impossible to find.   And I think buy-ic uses big square headers anyways that won't fit into machine sockets.....<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5779">Markfrizb</a> — Sun Nov 03, 2013 8:58 pm</p><hr />

Hello, my friend and i are tech junkies and recently came across the world of making your own snes game carts. After spending the last few days going over as many forums and guides as we can, we have learned alot about the procedure and we are almost ready to buy the parts and equipment we need. There are just a few things we really need cleared up.<br /><br />first I would like to say this is completely for personal use and it is not our intention or our goal to make any sort of profit from these games thank you!.<br /><br />We plan to use<br />FUJITSU MBM29F033C-90PTN -TSOP Adapter III<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.buyicnow.com/vp.php?pd=2621">http://www.buyicnow.com/vp.php?pd=2621</a><!-- m --><br /><br />and i will need the DIp40-Dip36 adapter<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.buyicnow.com/fincat.php?cat=1006">http://www.buyicnow.com/fincat.php?cat=1006</a><!-- m --><br /><br />and an eprom programmer.<br /><br />My understanding is.... find a 36 pin mask rom game (nhl 96).
