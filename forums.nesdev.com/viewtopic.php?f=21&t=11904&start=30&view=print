Is that mahogany color value 16?<br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/palette16.png" alt="Image" /><br />I know that might be an exaggeration, but if it were RGB, I think it would appear blood red.<br /><br />I'm definitely leaning towards one of the other two, and they're not far off what the SNES had either. But they <em>are</em> hard to distinguish from one another. What values are you using?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />NES doesn't do desaturated.<br /><br />Each color ($x1-$xC) alternates between the signal level for $x0 (a lighter gray) and $xD (a darker gray). For example, $16 (the red under question here) alternates between $10 in phases close to red and $1C in phases close to cyan. Both $0D and $1D are black, and both $20 and $30 are white. Because all colors other than gray touch either the black rail or the white rail, they are at the maximum possible saturation for the color's lightness level.

If not, I'll make one myself. Unless this is taken from an emulator?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Anywho, the time has come!</strong><br /><br />First, value 16 as the backdrop:<br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071627_001.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071627_002.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071627_003.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071627_004.png" alt="Image" /><br />Not bad; not bad at all! I can live with this! This is going off the YUV setting on Nestopia. One minor quibble, though: the hue for the blue tarp shares the hue for the sky. Shame, seeing as I found a near exact hue that matches the SNES sky. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071627_005.png" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071627_006.png" alt="Image" /><br />Oh God! I was right--RGB looks terrible. Bear in mind this is the same hue for Mario's overalls... right? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Next, the same thing, but I changed the sprite outlines to pink (hey, it worked for Link):<br /><img src="http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45990/2567412-9583629141-Link-.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071627x_001.png" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071627x_002.png" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071627x_003.png" alt="Image" /><br />Notably, as you can see on the right, the two hues blend together in RGB (in YUV as well, I guess).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, 017 as the backdrop:<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071727_001.png" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071727_002.png" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/Aladdin%20(E)%20%5Bp1%5D%5BhM04%5D%20-%20071727_003.png" alt="Image" /><br />Looks nice in both cases.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>And now... the moment of <s>truth</s> a single instance of an individual's consumer TV settings with arbitrary HSV adjustment that could quite possibly match no one else's:</strong><br /><br />Value 16 Backdrop:<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1238.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1240.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1241.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1242.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1243.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />Looks perfect! The torqouise blue works well for both the tarp and sky as well.<br /><br /><br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1244.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1246.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1247.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1248.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />Even my pink sprites kinda hold up well. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Value 17 Backdrop:<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1249.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1251.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1252.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />Hardly a difference! Which makes me lean towards value 17 seeing as it's not as drastic as a change and works well with most palette sets. But my new concern is changing the sprite palette hue of 37 -&gt; 27. The guard just doesn't have the contrast he originally had.<br /><br />Either way, I think it's safe to say we can go on ahead with changing sprite tiles; they're not dependent on the palette changes we'll be making. Plus, I want to try this test again with better Aladdin sprites.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />By the way, guess what was also on my Power Pak?<br /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1253.jpg" alt="Image" /><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/82042602/aladdin/DSCN1254.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me, my computer has politely requested that I restart it for the last hour.

The best way to feign a colorful image on a console like the NES is to use a lot of colors that stand apart from one another.  That said, I think the sky needs to be bluer to stand out better; we're going to have to balance color accuracy with color appeal.  I'm not a fan of how the guards look, they practically blend in with the background.  I think the standard sprite palettes looked the best.

I wouldn't say the games look horrible at all, unless they had horrible art and were hiding behind NTSC artifacts.<br /><br />I know I'm going to be excitedly replied to, provided with a bunch of examples of games' art assets which were <em>designed</em> for NTSC artifacts, but I still think it's comparable to cooking a meal expecting people to eat it weeks later after it has been sitting out. NTSC is a turd.<br /><br />I like the appearance of 0x16 as the backdrop with the brown outline. If you'd like me to test it on an RGB NES I'd be happy to.

The problem is that the 2C03 palette is not even remotely similar to the original one (even gray shades aren't safe), so basically everything will look horrible no matter what. If you get RGB with a palette closer to what it should be then that is fine.
