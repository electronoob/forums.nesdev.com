Yes you can say &quot;it's your fault that you modded your system&quot;, but if you're already supporting RG swap it's probably not that much effort to have a third option to disable emphasis too. At least, I think I would want to put that small amount of work not to just throw away that minority of potential users.<br /><br />It wouldn't look ideal with emphasis disabled, but the point is that it would still be playable that way.<br /><br />(Also that &quot;obscure collector&quot; may be a minority, but I suspect that same kind of person is more likely to be a vocal supporter too. In my view not a good trade to ignore, at least for something like this where I think the effort required is low.)

I use $2d a lot more than $00, it is overall more useful to me. It is for example a really nice blend together with $0x colours to get a washed out effect or smooth blending artifacts in a dithery texture. 00 is often too bright for both these purposes; it stands out which is good in other cases, but not always here. $3d mostly gives a little extra highlight that stands out a little better when next to certain colours, but the small difference makes the compromise more acceptable.

This can't be portrayed at all on the listed systems. <br /><br />-i also use dimming to get a smoother grayscale. This screen below is using both the $2d that is missing on RGB PPU:s, and dimming. The plastic casing would be plain white without dimming. You can't really compensate for the lack of dim with other colour choices, which is even worse. Dimming + $2d is the only way to make it as life-like as possible.<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

Making it work better is, well, better, but it's definitely in the nice gesture/extra mile territory someone was mentioning before. I'd still probably stick something like an &quot;doesn't look as good on with RGB PPU mod. Use an unmodified console for the best experience.&quot; disclaimer somewhere. It won't be as satisfying playing on these systems, so it'd be best to be upfront about it.

For NES though, I don't think there is enough hue resolution to really get the same colours anyway, and the NES is hardly able to produce &quot;natural&quot; looking colours even in the best conditions. I don't know the technical specs, but it the difference doesn't really seem to be equivalent to something simple like just a hue shift, it's a whole distortion of the colour space. I think it'd be hard to improve on the fidelity of just leaving it as-is, at least with the palette approximations I've seen?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-missing $2d (especially) and $3d colours can't be easily replaced by 00 and 10, if you're intentionally using $2d and $3d for specific techniques where 00 and 10 won't do as good.

It also really sucks that some commonly used emulator palettes don't make these colours distinct from $00 and $10. However, the minimum you have to do is just make the error cases where they appear black, or the same as the other greys, not make the game critically unplayable. (Much less of a problem than the 3 emphasis bits whiting out the whole screen.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-i also use dimming to get a smoother grayscale.

Dimming + $2d is the only way to make it as life-like as possible.</div><br />There's a point where you might be using a colour distinction that is too small to be reliable even on the majority case. How much can you e.g. adjust the gamma on the image before the subtle balance you're relying on doesn't work anymore? TVs vary a lot on this.<br /><br />Though at least graduations of grey should be monotonic, their relative distinction from each other is going to be less reliable. (Probably far less of a problem than trying to use horizontal hue relationships in the palette for relative brightness, though, as <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=168955#p168955" class="postlink">discussed in the past</a>).<br /><br />...though maybe this particular case is fine. I'd say the most important thing to do is just test things out in different conditions as much as you can. Use NTSC simulators with the settings in different extremes, etc. (I really wish we had more available PAL simulation.)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd still probably stick something like an &quot;doesn't look as good on with RGB PPU mod.

Though actually I think most modern RGB mods implement emphasis correctly. I'm not sure how I'd describe this particular set of problem hardware succinctly.<br /><br /><br />The main thing I meant about compatibility is just that <span style="text-decoration: underline">unplayable</span> is a <em>very bad</em> error case. Obvious graphical glitches that don't stop you from playing the game is almost insignificant compared to that (the ubiquity of sprite flicker is a testament to this). The graphics not quite looking their best is even less significant, relatively speaking. So... to me the amount of effort I'd want to spend mitigating these different cases would probably be proportionate to that. If it's not hard to prevent unplayability, for sure I'd try to do so.

How do you distinguish an authentic NES from an authentic Famicom from within a program intended to run on either?<br />A. NES drives bits 4 and 3 of $4016. Famicom leaves them open bus. Check whether bits 4 and 3 of $4016 are open bus by (ab)using the 6502 page wrapping quirk and the 2C02 io_db quirk.<br /><br />The rest of the topic so far is just increasingly elaborate ways to ask &quot;Why would you want to do that?&quot;. But did anyone get a chance to try the answer that was provided?

Although it's probably not easy to understand unless you learn more about the NES, so OP go on and study more and come back to it when you are wiser. It will pay off.<br /><br />Actually I think this thread managed to stay much closer to the topic than usual. The discussion went on with that things like PAL, RGB PPU, clones and such may normally be more beneficial to distinguish between than just Famicom and NES.

But just maybe there might be some cases where the semantic connotations of a colour trips over a threshold in some context. Basically, the colours may broadly represent different things. The problematic $22 is one such case. The problem isn't so much the hue variance in itself as what semantic connections we make. I don't think there's a general ruleset you can apply. Any hue changes probably needs to be evaluated case-for-case. The question i'd be asking in those cases would be: &quot;If a colour looks bad/wrong for its intended use on PAL (or RGB PPU:s i guess), what would be the less offending alternative? Is there one?&quot; This is a low priority, of course. Just like you said, game breaking features are more important than experience varying ones.

I'm not sure though, this seems like an open research survey question to me. I think the test would at least be good enough to distinguish 2C02 from the PC10/Sharp/etc 2C03/2C05 PPU replacement mod. Clones and emulators might be a lot more difficult problem.<br /><br />There's some info on mods here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://retrorgb.com/nesrgb.html">http://retrorgb.com/nesrgb.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The main culprit for emulator palettes that get the greys wrong is that awful FCEUX palette, I think, which is unfortunately way too popular. It made its way into both the AVS and the Hi-Def NES firmwares. Some info: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://rgbsource.blogspot.com/2016/10/avs-and-hi-def-nes-palettes-revisited.html">http://rgbsource.blogspot.com/2016/10/a ... sited.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />FWIW I don't think people are really doing the PC10 mod any <em>more</em>, since the newer RGB mod seems to be wholly better and cheaper, and doesn't rely on old parts. However... there's still lots of PC10 mods in the wild, and I doubt they'd get replaced under normal circumstances. (I wouldn't assume that someone who has a modded system or a titler would automatically have another system for back-up, either. Some would, but I'm sympathetic to a person who can't afford to acquire a second machine, or even would just rather play it on their favourite. There really aren't that many games that the titler emphasis breaks anyway, and the titler was popular enough in Japan to get a warning on some game boxes about the problem.)<br /><br />Even the swapped RG emphasis thing... there's a problem because <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Colour-emphasis_games" class="postlink">no games actually relied on it</a>, so emulators getting it wrong for PAL really didn't have much consequences. This is also relatively new knowledge and didn't even hit the Wiki until <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php?title=PPU_registers&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=8918" class="postlink">a small footnote in late 2014</a>, so even the &quot;new&quot; RGB mod isn't something I'd assume will get this right for PAL by default. (AVS and Hi-Def NES I would assume have done their homework here, though.)<br /><br />Maybe it would be useful to extend the <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Color_$0D_games" class="postlink">$0D games article</a> to include the other D column colours too. I actually have no idea which games used them, but I think it's similarly rare.<br /><br /><br />In short: those things in particular (emphasis and column D greys) are reliable hardware features on the original thing, but really iffy everywhere else because there just weren't any games to nail that stuff down for emulators or clones.<br /><br /><br />If I was going to rely on emphasis colours, I'd definitely make it a user configurable option just because the swapping was poorly known for so long. My naive idea of how to implement that would just be with 8 byte lookup tables, so it would be really easy to add a 3rd table of 0s to disable emphasis for the other case (that's what I mean about it probably being low effort to gain compatibility here). As for the extra greys... I don't think any code compensation is very useful, but just as long as those colours dropping out or being the wrong shade of grade doesn't stop the user from being able to play, they're probably alright to use.<br /><br />...though I suppose you could implement a grey simulation mode that alternates $00-$0F every frame in lieu of $2D, and $10-20 for $3D. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> That seems like going way over the top though. Then again, <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=201167" class="postlink">Macbee took that concept to its extreme for Lucky Penguin</a>, and then there's that Batman game or Alien Syndrome, etc. that use alternating frames for a blend too.<br /><br />...and deciding that caring about the inaccurate/modded/Titler cases is too much effort is a valid way to look at it anyway, just for me I don't think I'd ever take that attitude except for maybe a tech demo. I want as many people to be able to play my games as I can manage, and that shapes my opinion on this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The practical problem with user configurability is that users would find reconfiguring everything every time the system is turned on tedious. To atttempt to avoid that, you'd have to 1. make your mapper self-flashable, 2. exhaustively test that your configuration saving won't overwrite the game, and 3. hope the user doesn't regularly use two or more consoles or TVs with different characteristics.
