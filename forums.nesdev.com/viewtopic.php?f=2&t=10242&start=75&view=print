		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, but cc65 isn't as fast as assembly can be (which depends mostly on compiler and not language design - if compiler is smart and can optimize code well, there can be even very high level language compiled, such as Python as pyNES has shown), Alter Ego, a standard cc65 game, isn't exactly fast-paced and I'm interested into making bullet-hell shmup in future. UC65 makes good middle ground between assembly and high level language, similarly to what once NESHLA did (the only reason I don't use NESHLA is that isn't being actively developed and documentation is kinda poor).

For bullet hell you probably will have to move to another platform, not even SNES, because 64 or 128 bullets aren't exactly hellish enough.<br /><br />cc65 and uc65 could be used to create medium paced scrolling games like Super Mario Bros (proved with Sir Ababol) or Double Dragon.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Shiru, I think I'll be able to prove that anything you can do with pure ASM you can do with uc65. I've specifically designed the language to map directly to assembly construction patterns, and the code I'm generating these days looks identical to what I write by hand (except for calling subroutines with parameters in the registers).<br /><br />Time will tell anyhow <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> But I think you've given me my official challenge for the NESDev compo this year.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The same could apply to C as well. The question is just the speed. Do you plan to support things like unrolled loops and pre-generated code natively? Otherwise it is all about asm inlines, which would be the same for both cc65 and uc65.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yea, I mean uc65 should produce code that's very near the speed of hand-optimized assembly in most cases. The only cases I've found where I can do a better job than the optimizer I have currently implemented is with branch joins. Like when you have an if/else structure, on the other side of that the optimizer just assumes all register and flag values are unknown. When coding by hand you could know that the X register doesn't change in either branch, for instance. The same is true for subroutine calls.<br /><br />Well, the way the language works you can write an unrolled loop quite easily without using assembly. The only looping constructs are while and loop (conditional and unconditional looping respectively). So if you implement a loop and want it unrolled, you'll need to do that by hand. The compiler won't do it for you.<br /><br />This all ties back to the idea of using language constructs that are directly supported by the hardware. Again, it's not a high-level language. I call it a mid-level language, but if it helps you could think of it as high-level assembly.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Could you make optimizer to check whether e.g. X register (as in your example) doesn't change in either branch and then optimize it further?<br /><br />Also, could you implement 'for' loop? It is useful when you know you have certain amount of data to loop through (like array). Granted, you technically can do it in while loop, but it isn't elegant solution and you may after some months without seeing code think &quot;what the **** this code is doing?&quot;, especially when it is uncommented (worst crime programmer could commit IMO).

Use an array and it'll generate 20 lines of bloated code on each access instead of smartly using indexed addressing modes that were made for this very purpose.<br /><br />Also the language CAN be a performance issue in rarer cases, for instance if you have an array of pointers in C, you can't split it into low and high halves like you can in assembly. Well you COULD split it but then you wouldn't be able to use it as an array of pointers, which kill the point of it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Release Candidate 0.5-rc2 is out now. Per usual I've updated the first post with the new distribution package which now also includes full sources to avoid confusion. The project page has also been updated with the new distribution and documentation for the new features.<br /><br /><strong>New Features</strong><br /><br />The import statement allows you to spread your code into multiple files and import the exported variables, types, subroutines and constants for use in other files. The generated assembly files contain appropriate export, exportzp, import and importzp statements for later use by the linker.<br /><br />By default the directory containing the current source file is searched for an imported file, but additional search directories may be specified on the command line. Relative paths are also supported.<br /><br />Finally a new command line option has been added to generate GNU GCC-style auto dependency information suitable for GNU make.<br /><br /><strong>Going Forward</strong><br /><br />I have decided that instead of rolling my own build management system I am going to provide the support features in the compiler required to enable other standard, well-maintained build management systems to be used, such as GNU make. The new road map reflects this change in direction, as well as my intent to continue development of the NES target, libraries and examples.<br /><br />At this time no features are planned for immediate development, however I am still taking feature requests under consideration for a possible 0.6 development branch. I am comitted to providing support for the compiler, documentation and related materials until at least the end of the 2014 NESDEV competition. If the compiler proves useful and practical during this time frame I will of course continue it's development and maintenance.<br /><br />So yea, uc65 now recommended for use! Please send all bug reports or feature requests to this thread or the project issue tracker, including those pertaining to documentation and examples.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In general, ATALAN is higher-level than uc65 and performs more static code analysis in an attempt to make those higher-level constructs more efficient. This means that, much like C, you can write code that cannot be optimized if you are not careful. uc65 was designed with only language elements that map directly to 6502 machine constructs.<br /><br />Prior to starting work on uc65 (and it's predecessor project) I evaluated ATALAN. It was rejected as not meeting my requirements because it does not seem to handle banked code at all. I also did not care for the syntax, but then again uc65 also has a non-standard syntax.

Okay, that's two things, but you get my point.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A simple question: Which assembler has better docs: ca65 or NESHLA?<br /><br />It's not about amount of games made with either, it's about docs that explains them. NESHLA has beautiful syntax, I was given copy of sources of Grand Theftendo before it became Retro City Rampage (Brian probably doesn't remember it as it was few years ago) and it was more clear than code made with ca65 and I could exactly make up what each function did (remember that I didn't know jack $h17 about assembly, I still don't know everything).<br /><br />Unfortunately what it makes in clearness of syntax, it loses in documentation. NESHLA docs are virtually non-existent and if you make most clean language in the world but still won't have docs for it, you know you will fail as devs just won't know how to utilize it properly.<br /><br />Even pity NESASM has better docs that NESHLA.

Secondly it was several years ago (few months after &quot;&quot;announcing&quot; GT, was lurker here and on other nes forums, didn't bother to register and contacted Brian via e-mail to get some more details - surprisingly he sent me few source files and few additional screenshots. After so much times, details are so blurry that I only remember it just made sense.<br /><br />I have since then changed computers and probably don't have those anymore. Will check backup CDs, but I suppose it won't be there. Believe me, if I had still those files, I'd be writing docs instead of bitching how it was good, just as I did with pyNES.
