<br />Is the best one 32kb bank, two 16kb bank, two 8kb banks and one 16kb, or four 8kb banks ?

<br />
<br />The MMC3 happens to have a very convenient setup, where you have one switchable bank at $A000-$BFFF and an additional switchable bank which you can place at either $8000-$9FFF (to effectively give you a 16KB switchable bank at $8000-$BFFF) <strong>or</strong> at $C000-$DFFF (to allow the DPCM space to be banked). It's no wonder that the MMC3 was one of the most popular mappers used in USA games - it was reasonably simple (a 44-pin chip) but exceptionally versatile as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Effectively, DPCM samples can only be played from $c000-$ffff, so a MMC3 is needed to bankswitch them. However, I was asking in general, without using DPCM bankswitching.
<br />Has two 8kb banks in $8000-$bfff any advantage on a single 16kb bank ? It effectively makes you able to have two different bankswitchable data appart of the 16kb hardwired data at $c000-$ffff. But has this any significant advantage ?
<br />And is 32kb bankswitching good in any way other than simplify cartridge logic ?

A simple programm that reads bankswitched stuff can easily fit in the fixed bank, but a programm that decompress something is usually large because it needs large tables/dictionaries, and it would be better to bankswitch it in an auxiliary space.
<br />On another way, the Game Boy Color switches 16kb banks and have an hardwired 16kb bank just like the standard UNROM configuration. Many GBC games were much more modern and responsive than NES games, so it seems not to be a bad option.

<br />Wow ! I didn't know all of theese. I asked myself many many times why GBC games have so, so much better graphics than NES games with the same bitdepht.
<br />I think GBC also can hanldle the sprite priority bit on background map instead of just spries as the NES does, so this makes layering much easier to handle, isn't it ?
<br />Unfortunately there is much less doccuments available on Game Boy (not Advance) hardware for an unknow reason. There is general purpose doccuments, but none of theese goes in detail.
<br />Also, lot of GBC games (the ones wich aren't in a transparent cartcase) are backward compatible with older monochrome Game Boys, and so they have less VRAM and stuff.

The GBC has more layers than even a GBA based emulator can handle.

<br /><em>Nintendo Power</em> says that some of those have two completely separate game engines: one optimized for GB and one optimized for GBC.

Additionally, Nintendo would prefer having more people buying the new GBC than have people stuck with their old game boys. I foud that kinda strange. Now, the GBA plays the older games as if they were played on a GBC, regardless of the cartridge itself.
<br />The windows is a separate layer for text windows that cannot be scrolled, right ? That's a really good feature. It's a real shame the NES doesn't have this, so programmers have to "monkey" (to use your therms) doing mid-frame PPU writes, sprite zero hit, timed code, etc...
