<br />
<br />2 quick questons.  1) In the Processor Status register could we store a 4 bit binary number for a short time in bits 6 through 3? <span style="color: red">Well, "Assembly In One Step" shows the bits of the Processor Status register... </span><span style="color: orange">the 6th bit is set when an overflow of an addition or subtraction occurs</span>, <span style="color: brown">the 5th bit is never set/reset</span>, <span style="color: yellow">the 4th bit is "...set if an interrupt caused by a BRK [and] reset if caused by an external interupt..."</span>, <span style="color: cyan">and the 3rd bit doesn't matter cause it is only changed by two instructions and it's a flag for decimal mode which is missing on the nes, i think</span>.  So, is bit 4 the most changed-at random-times bit 'cause it is affected by interrupts?  I dont understand "interrupts" much; what are they (and does bit 2  of the Processor Status register kindof disable the random-change-ness of bit 4?)?  I'm floored and so excited that we can probably access the Processor Status register with PLP+PHA and PHP+PLA!!!!(just reread the kim1-6502 Appendixes and noticed that it says "Push <em>Processor Status</em> on Stack" and "Pull Accumulator from Stack" and PLP and PHA <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">AND</span> "Assembly In One Step" calls the fourth register "Processor Status")!!!!!21 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> 
<br />2) Um.. i dont remember my second question ...sorry  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> (i'll respond to yalls previous posts, maybe later... good night. : )

<br />They interrupt (hence their name) the program in order to run some other piece of code. Important events generate interrupts because such events need to be handled right away. For example, if NMIs are enabled, this interrupt will fire when VBlank starts. The start of VBlank is an important event, so it makes sense to interrupt whatever the PPU is doing so that the full duration of VBlank can be used for VRAM updates. Scanline interrupts are also important, because they fire at the exact moment that a certain scanline is being rendered, so if you want to do some kind of raster effect at that location you have to immediately respond to the event.
<br />
<br />When an interrupt occurs, the program counter and the status flags are pushed to the stack, so that when the interrupt handler is over the CPU can resume whatever it was doing, without even realizing it was interrupted. If you need to modify any registers inside the interrupt handlers, you have to back them up to the stack and restore them after returning, or else the code that was interrupted will most likely crash.

<br />And so my question (edit: wait for it:)) to all of the asm6 user people:  I'm trying to quote <div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="color: #fffc00">It may seem strange if you are doing it in a hardcoded way (manually setting up all the sprites of a particular object), but usually programmers implement a sprite system. For each possible frame of a character there is a list of the necessary sprites to draw it. It's just a series of .db or .dw statements that represent things like "this frame needs 4 sprites; the first one is at coordinates (4, 5) and uses tile $78; the second is at coordinates (12,  and  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> uses tile $79 (...)". The coordinates are usually relative to the position of the object/character being drawn. This means that the sprite system can draw any frame of any character if you point it to the correct list. </span></div> from <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=5770&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=2" class="postlink">this</a> thread. btw, thread starts at 0. Not 2.
<br />
<br />I am worrying about not being able to set a variable inside the series of .db statements.... i want something like 
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">aY .byte 10<br />aX .byte 20<br />.db aY, $80, $00, aX, aY, $81, $00, aX +1</div>
<br />
<br />Do you all think that will work? im getting excited now... thinking it may be possible!

<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">EQU<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For literal string replacement, similar to #define in C.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one EQU 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plus EQU +<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DB one plus one ;DB 1 + 1<br /></div><br /><br />So your example above becomes:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">aY EQU 10 <br />aX EQU 20 <br />.db aY, $80, $00, aX, aY, $81, $00, aX +1<br /></div>
<br />
<br />
<br />Remember, the .byte and .db directives emit a byte of data into the output ROM file. The EQU directive (and it's cousin, the = operator) create symbols within the assembler that you can use latter on.

The EQU directive (and it's cousin, the = operator) create symbols within the assembler that you can use latter on.</div>
<br />Thank you qbradq! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />What are symbols?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Does that mean that symbols are variables that dont exist in the ROM?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />They exist only in the source code to make programming easier (just imagine if you had to remember the addresses of everything!), they do not exist in the assembled program.

<br />
<br />edit: I've started with asm6... and the NES 101 tutorial by... Michael Martin.  There is a file i made for the ... vblank part; and am trying to transfer all the vblank code to it.    Started with just the three lines: 
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">jsr scroll_screen<br />jsr update_sprite<br />jsr react_to_input<br />rti</div><br /><br />anddd, it worked!!! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  The ... links seem to work through different files! Amazing! And... don't remember what i was thinking, sorry<br />...[/code]
<br />
<br />OH! I don't know if the code for the sound file thing should be copied over to the vblank part cause even though there is a link from the react_to_input code to it, it is still not vblank ppu code... is it?  No, i dont think it is, because that's part of the CPU... it is also a pAPU pseudo-Audio Processing Unit!   So even though it seems to .... not "link"... link to the Audio code it's not part of vblank, right?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />
