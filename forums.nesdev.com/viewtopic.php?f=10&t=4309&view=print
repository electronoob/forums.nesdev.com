		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,
<br />
<br />This may seem like a pretty dumb question, but I need to ask it.  I'm currently in the process of making some repro carts, and was wondering if it were possible to use burned chips of a game that originally used TLROM onto a TSROM donor cart.  Since the game wouldn't be using the 8K of W-RAM, wouldn't that still be okay?
<br />
<br />I know that there are differences between the 3, but if they're using the same mapper and I rewire the cart properly to take the EPROMS, would they work?  I just seem to have way too many SMB3 carts laying around that I wouldn't mind putting to good use <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />They would work (with the exeption of Low G Man), but that would be a real waste considering you can find lots of cheap TLROM games arround. You'd want to preserve a TSROM or TKROM boards for a project that actually needs SRAM (like Final Fantasy 3 or the incoming Sonic game by Tokumaru)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's actually a really good point.  I wouldn't mind having an FF3 cart in the future, so I'll hold on to some of them for sure.  I'll have to go hunting for some TLROM boards, since there definitely are a TON of them.  Also planning on making a TSROM devcart with sockets as well.  
<br />
<br />What about the Sonic game that you're referring to?  Haven't heard anything about that.
<br />
<br />Thanks a lot for the help!  Always appreciated.

<br />It's the game I'm working on... I haven't released much info on it yet, so all you can see right now is my avatar! =)
<br />
<br />The map scrolling engine is fully working and the object/sprite system is nearly complete. Sonic itself hasn't been programmed, and there isn't any sort of physics yet.
<br />
<br />I've been way too busy with real world stuff lately, but I always try to work on this game at least a bit every week. I expect to have something concrete to show before the end of the year, at which point I'll ask for contributions in the sprite and music departments, so things will probably start moving faster by then.
