Nearly all dev/flash carts are capable of LARGE (GBits) worth of ROM, whether they are made easily available to the user might be different story, but all the ones I know of have the hardware to support.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I said 32KB WRAM. That's nothing, even Nintendo carts have that much. 2MB ROMS. I dunno what you're talking about. And it has to be parallel because I want to actually use it? Although yeah, serial would be cool too. A 32KB serial ROM would be nice for making an RPG. But if it was 32KB, I would want twice the serial ROM size to keep a good even chunk of SRAM just for RAM usage.

I dunno what you're talking about. </div><br /><br />I'm saying it doesn't make sense for a flash/dev cart to have &gt;512KB SRAMs to support 2MB parallel ROMs.  What does make sense is to have the potential for excessively large serial memory storage.  All the ones I know about on the market or under development can supply you with excessive amounts of data if configured properly.  Powerpak CF card, infiniteNES SD, NESDEV1 SPI/USB, Funkyflash SD, INL-ROM SPI, ENIO microSD/net, This one is SD I'm guessing... etc.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">3gengames wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A 32KB serial ROM would be nice for making an RPG. But if it was 32KB, I would want twice the serial ROM size to keep a good even chunk of SRAM just for RAM usage.</div><br /><br />How did you go from needing 2MB PRG/CHR parallel to being thrilled with the idea of 32KB serial???  Or is it just a K/M typo?<br /><br />512KB of SRAM which seems to be the standard sounds like plenty of space for one time frame, pretty sure the NES can't consume that much data on it's own in a relatively short amount of time...  Except perhaps sound I guess.

Hence the flash/dev carts you're complaining about only support 512KB PRG/CHR.  All I'm trying to explain to you is WHY they're all 512KB, because they're ALL SRAM 'ROMS'.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />If you allowed some of that 512KB of PRG-RAM (not WRAM, that's separate...) to be writable you could load serial memory data onto the PRG-RxM.  Which would be ample for your desires.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Typically KRIKzz uses flashrom. I think EverDrive 64 used SDRAM but the rest of the carts I think all used FlashROM. Perhaps if you look at the picture he posted you could identify if he is using SRAM or FlashROM for PRG and CHR storage. The PowerPAK we know uses SRAM.
