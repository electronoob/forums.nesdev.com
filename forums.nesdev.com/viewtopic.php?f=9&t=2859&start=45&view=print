<br />I can tell you (and I already did) that it's not the wire. The wire is there for an address line that isn't even used in Excitebike, so this game should run fine with the board even if there was something wrong about the wire.

<br />Well dude, I've still got AM29F040B which is effectively the same.  Might be cheaper shipping, definitely faster than from Thailand.

<br />
<br />but I got 4x AT29C040 32 pin Off ebay (tonight for 23$ shipped)
<br />
<br />it will be shipped from like HK ...
<br />but still price was good i was just browsing when i saw them <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br /> i have a question
<br />
<br />How can i ''make my MMC1'' more compatible?
<br />
<br />It's a Heavy shreddin cartridge  (it's written MMC1) SLROM -05
<br />
<br />
<br />i want to start the project.
<br />
<br />Starting with the CHR (32 pin socket)
<br />
<br />But i don't know where to find the correct info for that &amp; which are the good solder points.
<br />
<br />I found some today while searching but they tell which pin to bend but it doesn't tell me where they are ect..
<br />
<br />
<br />But i am REALLY confused....
<br />on one side i got a 32 pin (CHR) on the other side i got only 28 pins.....
<br />I will need to fit a 32 there too since the games are like 128k...
<br />there is 2 extra  hole but they are filled with factory solder they are maybe Grounds...

<br />Yeah, that happens. 128KB PRG ROMs from Nintendo have 28 pins, while any programmable chip that size has 32 pins. 128KB CHR Nintendo ROMs on the other hand have 32 pins.
<br />
<br />With my UOROM cart I had to remove the 28-pin chip and put my 32-pin one. In fact, the rewiring for the PRG chip in your MMC1 board could be almost exactly like mine (I think you can see it well from the pics I posted). The only difference would be A17, which I soldered to the small chip to the left so that I could use 256KB instead of just 128KB.
<br />
<br />If you want only 128KB of PRG, you could do the exact same thing I did in my cart, but wiring that A17 to GND (the same place where A18 was connected). But if you want to use 256KB, which I believe the MMC1 supports, you'll have to check where in the MMC1 chip the A17 line is connected. Look at the pinout of the MMC1 chip to verify that.
<br />
<br />I haven't tried replacing CHR ROMs yet, so I don't have anything ready for those.

<br />In my cart, all the pins with wires are the ones bent up. All others are soldered normally. As you can see, 6 pins had to be rewired (but 2 of them use the same wire, the top 2 on the right). Your rewiring should be the same, only pin 30 (A17, the 3rd one from the top on the right) should be connected to ground (to support 128KB games) or to MMC1's A17 pin (to support 256KB games).
<br />
<br />Note that when I say "top" I'm always talking about the top of the chip, the part with the notch, it has nothing to do with the orientation of the board or the pictures. Just to make it clear.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SLROM board was designed to take both 128kb and 256kb mask ROMs.
<br />On standard pinout EPROMs, both have the same pinout, exept that A17 is NC on 128kb EPROMs.
<br />But for Nintendo roms, both have a weird pinout, and the number of pins was reducted on the 128kb mask ROM to reduce pin count ( /OE, P and VPP aren't needed, so they are removed, and with the additionnal NC pin, that makes 28 left !). Since the 256kb mas ROMs does need the A17 pin, there was no other solution but keep the thing in DIP-32.
<br />In summary those unused pins are all to VCC exept one of them wich is A17, and is unused on 128k cards. Just remove the solder into them (bendindg up pins will work as well, but I'd avoid it for long-term mechanical issues). This don't affect much the way you must rewire the EPROM. You have to cut A17 line anyway, and to port it to the real A17 pin is needed only if your EPROM is 256k.
