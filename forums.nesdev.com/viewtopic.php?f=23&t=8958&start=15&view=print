Thought I could do with maps that fit into 64x64 sections or really tall maps. In the end, that was a bad call. (who saw that one coming!?) So I spent part of the weekend shoving it back in there. Doesn't support coins yet but it'll do so again soon. <br /><br />I originally took it out because it was slow and complicated, but I've got some ideas of how to make it faster and still support large maps with coins.<br /><br />Also fixed a long standing issue where the code didn't support maps taller than 64 tiles. It only supported long maps. <br /><br />So the video shows a large 256x128 map with enemies and blocks.

Notice that they're used to help the player navigate the level by providing hints about the terrain. <br />- New status bar. While not as nice as the floating UI icons from the previous versions, it takes much less CPU to compute. I might revisit this.

Added it to the background plane, which screwed up the colors of the normal background tiles, but oh well. It's just a test.<br /><br />Some of the tiles are screwed up because I probably didn't use PyxelEdit correctly. It can remove duplicate tiles, including ones that are rotated but that doesn't work on Genesis hardware, which only does horizontal and vertical flipping of tiles. <br /><br />Next steps are to reduce the number of unique tiles (there are many 1 or 2 pixel tiles), export them better, create sprites out of the moveable/animated parts (which will also reduce the number of duplicate tiles), and see if I can combine palettes.

I hadn't yet encountered, (or thought of) that. I guess I'll make a comment to the developer about it. That could make one lose tiles and not realize it until it's too late.

But from what I gather HuC has problems (of which I don't know the extent) and has pretty much been abandoned.
