<br />Sorry but I just couldn't help but laugh. Especially since the person made such a long post. After just the first line, I thought 'nooooooo, don't write any more'. You've gotta admit though, you'd have thought that they would have read up a little about sprites first.

People familiar with modern graphics systems don't expect odd things like this. Say you put four sprites at y=0, the next four at y=7, then move an eighth from y=0 to y=16. It will have a slice missing at line 7, which is pretty odd.

<br />Depends. Some languages have a verb inflection called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjunctive_mood" class="postlink">subjunctive mood</a>. The modern English realization of subjunctive is to use the infinitive form in present and third-person plural in past for all persons. Not all languages have the same rules, and even dialects of English are inconsistent.
<br />
<br />Does expression of tolerance make me a "grammar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" class="postlink">Ally</a>"?

I mean, every crappy NES document I have ever read has mentioned that small fact. I still think that it was hilarious, though.
