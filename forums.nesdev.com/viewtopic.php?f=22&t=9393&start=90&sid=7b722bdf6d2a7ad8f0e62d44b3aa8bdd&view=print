I think I mentioned it awhile back, but I will do whatever I have to do to ensure that contributors do have the opportunity to buy one.  So even if there were some sort of issue I'd crank out a few more to ensure contributors could have a copy.  The current plan is to sell them on my site.  Once they are all ready to go, we'll announce the time the item will go live for purchase.  Probably a Friday/Saturday that's more likely to be convenient for people.<br /><br />If something happens to where they're all bought up in the first couple mins and there are a large number of people who didn't have the opportunity to buy them we'll come up with a plan to make more.  There are a lot of variables and things to consider in this event, I figure we'll cross that bridge and discuss the plan when the time comes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Any news?</div><br /><br />Yeah sorry about not being so great on the updates, I've been holding back hoping to make one big saying I'm done with the official release date.  Here's where I'm at right now:<br /><br />I'm getting to the nitty gritty right now on the assembly.  They are all done asside from soldering the jumpers and caps on the bottom side.  I'm expecting to have that done this weekend.  Additionally I have all the labels and have about half of them cut out by hand so far.  I think it's reasonable acheiveable for me to be ready to go in two weeks. <br /><br />There is only one minor item I just realized I'm missing the other day.  The cases I got from Retrousb don't appear to have the screws included...  I should open every last bag/case to verify they didn't shove them all in one case, but I couldn't find them when I looked in obvious locations...<br /><br />So now is probably a good time to iron out the details on the release though.  I want to hold off on the exact date until they are all fully assembled and ready to go though.  Is there a desired time/day that we'd like to use for them to officially go on sale?  I'm thinking something like 9pm on a Saturday E.S.T ?  <br /><br />Additionally i'd like to try and set up a way for contributors to have priority access, what do you guys think about that?  I was originally thinking of setting up two separate items, one for check by contributors and another for general public.  But if the contributors don't all buy a cart it gets messy on when/how to list the left-overs for sale.  Perhaps I could just separate it by time.  Last time I counted ~14 direct contributors IIRC.  So maybe I could list up that limited qty and have a text feild entry for the contributors name/handle/game.  Should probably make an official list if we're going to go this route.  Thinking maybe contributors listed up for sale ~week prior, then general public the following week.  That would give some time to resolve any issues and allow the contributors a good chance to get a copy.<br /><br />As for the CIC's I got all the files needed from Jim's Cool, and should be able to support multi-region switching CIC that maintains last known good region.  eightbitdreams hooked me up with a PAL NES mobo so I can test that out just to verify.<br /><br />The only other detail is settling on a price.  I'm thinking $35 U.S.D. with $6 shipping U.S. priority mail and $10 shipping intl 1st class. <br /><br />I have all the BOM with my costs and will post them up with total expenses, but I don't have it on me at the moment.  It all came out pretty close to my original estimate:<br /><br />Assuming we sold all 50, after covering expenses prizes we'd have:<br />@$20 ~$175 earned<br />@$30 ~$675 earned<br />@$40 ~$1175 earned<br /><br />Please speak now, or forever hold your peace on the pricing matters <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  If no one chimes in I'll just go with $35.

Or we can go $35 for the contributors and $40 to others, although personally I don't really care one way or another.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I like thefox's idea for $35 for contributors and $40 for general public (their contribution can be the extra $5 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />If we're wanting to do another run immediately following this it's in our best interest to charge $40.  The total cost on the carts comes out to just under $12 with free assembly.  For the most part I should be able to maintain the $12 cost on parts for another run, the only thing I can't be certain of is cost of cases and labels.  We got ~$1 on cases and the labels were donated.  Additionally the time I have available for assembly is very limited these days so I'll have to get someone to assemble them for me completely to prevent delays like we're seeing right now.  If there's someone here who'd like to step up to the plate on that they're welcome to.  But I've got some family members who have picked up the assembly task for me on my other boards, and I can get them to take on a second run of these without much issue.  That'll cost us around $5-6 per cart including pcb assembly, casing/label, and handling of order to get it out the door.  So basically what I'm trying to conclude is that the cost of a second run will be around $18-20 per cart at most.  So another run of 50 will require another $900-1000 if assembly isn't free.<br /><br />Now using that info on figuring out how much we want to charge this time around $12x50 =$600 total cart cost this time around.  $175 prize payout for last compo starts us off at $775 in the hole.  Selling them at $35 each brings in $1750 leaving us with $975 earnings.  Upping the price to $40 would leave us with $1225 earned.  If we wanted to have $35 for contributors and $40 for general sales it only 'costs' us up to ~$70, so we'd earn at least $1150.  Personally I think we should take at least $200 of that and save it for next compo payout, which we could do and still have enough for another run of 50 carts.  $35 across the board would be just about enough for another run of carts, but not much to spare.<br /><br />Also I'd be interested to see what our plans are for another compo.  That's really what we're driving to here, so it might be a good idea to 'advertise' the next compo as we're announcing the cart release.  I think it'd be nice to offer some better prizes this time around, perhaps doubling the payout from the last compo.
