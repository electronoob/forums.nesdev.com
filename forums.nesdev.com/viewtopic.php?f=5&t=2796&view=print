This makes the SMS image perfectly fit the 4:3 ratio (i.e. it has square pixels) while the NES outputs images that are somewhat stretched.<br /><br />About the colors, this must be the biggest difference between them! Colors on the NES are defined in some sort of HSL variant, while the SMS uses 6-bit RGB values. Both can generate 64 colors, although not the same 64, and some of those are just black on the NES.<br /><br />Also, the NES has 8 palettes of 4 colors each, and each tile can use only 4 colors. The SMS has 2 palettes of 16 colors! Each tile can use up to 16 colors! This is a major advantage over the NES. It can produce much nicer graphics. I'm not saying it always does, but it can.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But which one is better than the other? <br /><br />Technically speaking, I have a feeling that it's SMS, but I'm not sure.</div><br />Technically, the SMS is clearly superior. The only disadvantges I can think of is that the SMS can't mirror sprites (although it can mirror background tiles). I guess that the lack of choice between VRAM and VROM could be a disadvantage too, but not a very big one.<br /><br />Also, since color depth is much better on the SMS, there is not enough room for all 512 tiles that could be addressed, I believe it only uses 448.<br /><br />However, the SMS allows you to decide how to use VRAM, and you have some control over where things like patterns and name tables are stored in VRAM, allowing for some nice tricks.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Anyway, when it comes to programming, NES just _have_ to be easier to program for. The Z80 is just a huge mess.<br /><br />But what's your opinion?</div>
<br />I never actually progammed the SMS, but I want to sometime soon. From what I've read, it doesn't sem any harder than programming the NES, just different.
<br />
<br />There are only a few memory mappers for the SMS so this is already much simpler than with the NES. I read that it's easier to set up scanline interrupts in it too.
<br />
<br />Graphically, I'd think it's easier to work with the background on the SMS. There is no need to work with complicated attribute tables (one of the biggest flaws on the NES, IMO). Also, the SMS seem to be able to work much faster with video. In games such as Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, it is able to draw huge "software sprites", meaning it can update a huge ammount of tiles in little time.
<br />
<br />I think the Z80 is a nice processor. Along with the 6502, they are the cooles processors I've ever studied! =)
<br />
<br />I like both system, a lot, but I have to say that the SMS is technically superior. The problem is that it doesn't have that many good games, the NES library is much bigger and better. I think there were legal issues at the time, that didn't allow companies that made games for Nintendo to make them for Sega too. And having to choose, of course they pick the most popular system. I think that's what killed the SMS.

And as long as you try to code 6502-styled programs with it, it will still feel that way. But once you get used to how it's supposed to work, it is a very powerful processor.<br /><br />It has instructions for looping, a second set of registers and other things that are supposed to make programming easier, and maybe it does. It has a lot of registers (when compared to the 6502), so you can have register-oriented logic, instead of memory-oriented like in the 6502.<br /><br />I think it is a nice processor, but you have to get used to it, as it's very different to the 6502 when it comes to programming style.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It may all come to sense if you learn to use it properly, but it seems quite strange to me :/</div><br />I'm much more fluent in 6502 (actually, not at all with the Z80) assembly, and I'm pretty sure I can't use the Z80 properly yet either.

<br />I'm not sure about that, but I know that in NTSC, the internal size of the "name table" (I don't think they call it that) is 256x224 pixels (32x28 tiles), but I don't know if you can display it all. Maybe you even can, but most games don't because of scrolling. I wouldn't know about PAL.

The background color is not shared among the two palettes.  You can also do raster effects to change the palette, Sonic 1 does this for a water-level in the Labyrinth Zone.
<br />
<br />As for graphics capabilities comparison, it's actually a mixed bag.  The NES's 2-bit graphics are clearly inferior to the SMS's 4-bit graphics, but 2-bit tiles take up far less space than 4-bit tiles.  So graphics for the SMS take up much more space in the ROM.  You also need to either do software sprite flipping, or store reversed versions of the tiles in rom.  Many SMS games also didn't take advantage of the large color depth, and only used very few colors per tile, but that's not the fault of the system.
<br />Since the chr memory can not be mapped into the cartridge slot, the SMS could never do tile animation to the extent seen in Gremlins 2 or Return of the Joker.
<br />Sound-wise, the NES wins by far.  The SMS can't select duty cycles for the square waves, and does not have a DMC channel.  SMS/GG games sound almost the same, except for maybe a different melody each game.  It's not like the NES where you can listen to the game music and immediately identify the company who made the game.
<br />
<br />Personally, I love the Z80 and can't stand the 6502.  But that tends to happen if you spend High School programming ASM games for your TI83.

<br />I meant 64 colors to pick from. I know it can have 32 in use at a time, but those can be chosen from a total of 64 colors, like on the NES. The Game Gear can pick from 4096, I think.

<br />Not really. It can scale the sprites, but only to twice their size. And you can't even apply this transformation to individual sprites, it's either all or none of them.
<br />
<br />This makes this scaling kinda useless. If you could apply that to individual sprites, you could make huge bosses or things like that. But as it is, if you try that you'll scale the player also, and then there is no point.

<br />Really ? I trough those TI calculators had a 6800 CPU in them ? At least I've the TI V200, but I've never programmed it unfortunately, because it has so much features and the manual is confusing. I just use it for standard algebra and all.
<br />
<br />I know nothing about the SMS, but it sems like Sega did everything to get their machine technically supperior to the NES, while maitaining useless features all the way along. One single sprite palette is stupid, because regardless of how many colors you get in it, that means that you have to keep that same palette all the game along, and that all object will look the same everywhere (or just limit your objects to 2 bits and code software decoding to 4-bit and palette-region swapping, supporting 5 palettes overall).
<br />Sprite strecthing sound ridiculous as Tokumaru stated it, being totally useless, unless for some cutscenes maybe if you're lazy and want to get pixelised stuff on screen.
<br />Sprite flipping is necessary to all platform games, wich was the dominant genre back then. Unless you make your game have so much detail that monsters aren't just mirrored from left to right, you could do flipping in software and dynamicly upload the pattern table if the console allow so (at least the NES don't, but maybe the SMS does).
<br />In that case VRAM is much more powerfull than VROM anyway, the only advantage VROM has in the NES is if you want to switch it fastly, and if you're just too lazy to make your own pattern-table writing code in quick NROM demos.

In determining this size, all that matters is how long each pixel lasts in the video signal; vertical resolution is irrelevant as a scanline is always a scanline, regardless of how many are black at the bottom of the screen. Likewise, the ratio of the width to height (in pixels) of the active video area has no relation to the ratio of the width to height of a single pixel.

<br />I have no idea what you're talking about here. I think both Sega systems have superior image quality when compared to the NES. I haven't played with my real SMS for a while though, but used the Genesis/Megadrive a couple of weeks ago. I can't see those artifacts you're talking about.
