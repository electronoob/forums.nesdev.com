		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've only played Rockman 1 and 2. If I have to rate these two I'll always take 1 over 2.<br />While I understand how most people consider the second game a huge improvement over the first I still think the original game pwned its sequels, because of the following (personal) reasons, in no particular order:<br /><br />1. Scores. I know that they actually did nothing but removing the whole system made me feel something was missing. The satisfaction of defeating any enemy was lost. Why shoot an enemy if there was no reward? Even though you might still enjoy advancing thru the game by defeating a boss, the absence of scores made defeating a boss just like any ordinary enemy. Also, in the absence of scores when you beat the game, you just... beat the game, and you couldn't, say, compete with your friends with like &quot;Hey! I completed the game with a much higher score than you did!&quot; (I've heard that the score system was heavily bugged in Rockman 2, so instead of fixing it they just remove this feature. This.is.very.unfortunate.)<br /><br />2. The pause trick. Yes, it was a game-breaking glitch but the Rockman games were just too horribly difficult and I was never that good a player. My life was just made easier by abusing the trick. This made me consider this a trick that provided advantages to players instead of a bug. After all, a player could choose whether to use it. No one forced you to use this trick to get past the game.<br /><br />3. Elemental effects. These were used to the fullest extent in the first game, and that's what made the game stand out from other action platformers. In the sequels, while the designs of the weapons and bosses might look more interesting(and more eye-candies in the stage decorations), they just <em>looked</em> different and are uninspiring. Bubbles? Ninjas? These are like jokes.<br /><br />4. Simplicity. Some of the additions in the latter games made things too complicated, like for example the <s>moving springboard</s> robot dog companion.<br /><br />5. Music. To me, the short tune that played after choosing a stage (the one that played when the boss jumped out) was one of the most memorable tunes in the whole series. In the original game, this tune was mixed with SE of scores adding up at the end. IMO this made the tune much richer and I already considered the SE an integrated part of the tune. In the sequel, because of point 1, the tune sounded like something was missing to me. The same happened to the jingle after you had beaten a boss. The musics in these two games actually are on par with each other but because of this I still take 1 over 2.

All together from hardest to easiest I'd say it goes 1,3,5,4,6,2. <br /><br />2. Definitely Mega Man 2 is the most popular. I think 4 and 6 might be the least popular of the bunch. I think 5 stood out a bit more than those two. But I think the first 3 are the most popular.<br /><br />3. That's really tough to say. I think they're all good games. Mega Man 2 is great for a quick play through because it's easy. The music is good too. Mega Man 3 has alot more game to play through though. I think 2, 3, and 5 contend for the best with 1, 4, and 6 being lower than those. <br /><br />That's my opinion.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1. Which one is the hardest? Mega Man 1. Two words... Yellow Devil. The Yellow Devil is hard enough, add in those moving shooting platforms above instant spike death... that's a hair pulling nightmare.<br />2. Which one was the most popular? Mega Man 2 for sure. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that once you get the metal blade, the game becomes a lot easier. <br />3. Which one is the best? Mega Man 3 personally. Something about 3 feels right to me. It's a good balance of new ideas, and old themes tied into one. The sound track for 3 is also very good. And I LOVE that the Mega Man 2 bosses make a come back.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hardest<br />I think all three first games are almost equally hard. 1 is hard at times but short, 2 is really only hard in some stages of the Wily Castle, and 3 would be the hardest of them (especially since you need to fight two Doc robots per stage later on) if it wouldn't be for the super easy Wily Castle stages. I haven't played enough of the other games to say for sure but they seem to be about medium hard. 7 is very hard at the end but I guess only NES games count.<br /><br />Most popular<br />Yeah 2 is definitely the most popular one. It was the first game for many people.<br /><br />Best<br />My personal favourite is 3. Cubeboy pretty much nails it. I like the slide move, Rush adapters, even though exploiting the Rush Jet almost feels like cheating, and Doc robots that uses old robots' programming. The music is great, but so is the music for 1 and 2. I would rank them 3, 1, 2, 6, 4/5. I'm not sure which is better of 4 and 5.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Am I the only one who thinks 4 is way harder than 1-2-3 together ?<br /><br />In most stages, the enemies needs to take a LOT of damage before they die, are you are supposed to use your mega buster, but doing so is slow and annoying. In 1-2-3 the enemies dies after one or two shots. There is those extremely annoying flying enemies everywhere and there is nothing comarable in 1-2-3.<br /><br />Most bosses of 4 can't be beaten without their weakness as their attacks are fast as lightning and impossible to avoid, so your only hope is to kamikaze and kill them before they kill you using their weakness. Except for some exceptions (such as Needle Man, Shadow Man or Elec Man), most bosses of 1-2-3 can be beaten with the Mega Buster if you're prepared enough.<br /><br />And the wily stages of 4 are even more hard than the normal stages, especially the bosses which are multi part and it's hard to find their weak point. The last battle is simply ridiculous, you only see Wily for 1 frame and he's invisible 99% of the time, and you can only hit him with one of the weapons. Without save states that one battle alone is plain I-M-P-O-S-S-I-B-L-E.<br /><br />I think 4 is definitely the hardest one, far harder than 7 which is already extremely hard in the Wily stages (but normally hard for the normal stages).<br />And it's true the yellow devil in 1 is insanely hard, but the rest of the game is relatively easy (except that part in Ice Man's stage where there is no ground), and you can overcome it easily with the pause trick.<br /><br />2 and 3 are definitely very easy, as you can have plenty of E-Tanks so if you're in trouble you can always refill health.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, it looks like 2 is generally regarded as the easiest and the most popular one.<br /><br />Why is the yellow devil in MM1 considered so hard? I haven't played against him myself yet, but as far as I see in the videos on YouTube, isn't this just about evading his body parts? I cannot imagine that <em>this</em> is the hardest thing of all MM1, 2 and 3.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would say the Yellow Devil requires patience. You need to memorize the pattern, and it's a long battle if you don't use the pause trick. If you can learn the pattern, and can keep up your concentration long enough to finish, I think it's a very easy fight.<br /><br />IMO, it's hard only if you are unwilling to memorize the pattern.
