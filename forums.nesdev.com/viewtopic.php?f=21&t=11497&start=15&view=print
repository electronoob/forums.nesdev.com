The window on the upper door would have to have sprites overlayed to be that color, but since there are no other sprites than the player in the village, that seemed feasable.

For the Wonderboy III mockup it would be enough to just change two colors in the palette after the statusbar to make a big difference (the dark gray to a slightly lighter gray, and the red to an even lighter gray), and with two more color changes for the sprite palettes the &quot;potion&quot; could be colorized aswell with two sprites - without having to sacrifice an entire palette that could be used for the player and enemies and all that stuff. <br /><br />Here's how it would look with those features:<br /><br /><img src="http://driar.se/pic/nes/wonderboy3_paletteswitch.png" alt="Image" />

This basically means it can only be used for bottom status bars.<br />It's <em>conceivable</em> that there are specific (mid-scanline) times when you could disable and re-enable rendering such that it would not damage sprites (during the time that OAMADDR is 0), but it would produce an irregular edges on the relevant scanline.

At the end of this blank scanline, fix the scroll using $2005/6 magic and enable background rendering. Based on this I believe you need 1 blank scanline for every 2 colors you need to change.</s><br /><br />The above is wrong, sorry. That HBlank window can be used to set the internal PPU address (for scrolling purposes), but you can't write data to the PPU because it's using the data bus to fetch sprite patterns. I guess my NESDEV skills are starting to get a little rusty! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

I might contribute some time in the future, but these screens are gorgeous.

For example SMB's status bar has 16 pixels of padding on top and 24 pixels on left and right.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know about the overscan, haven't really thought about it when doing any of my mockups though, but I'm gonna try and think about it for any future ones (because I want them to be as believable as possible, sort of how the game actually might have looked, had it been ported to the NES). Since most of the systems I'm using as inspiration has a lower vertical resolution than the NES, it never should be a problem really.  <br /><br />Does anyone have any idea if the Master System cuts off more or less of the picture than the NES horizontally? I was just thinking because Wonderboy III on the Master System has the hearts all the way to the left on it's statusbar, like I did it in the mockup. Then again, I think it's the leftmost column that get's hidden for scrolling so perhaps there actually is 8 pixels on both sides that are unused but didn't show in the picture I looked at.

Both the SMS VDP and the NES PPU use the TMS9918 dot clock rate, which is 3/2 of the NTSC colorburst rate. This means the width of active picture is the same for both platforms, but the side-to-side positioning may differ slightly for a couple trivial reasons.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Practically all Master System games that scroll horizontally mask the leftmost column (8 pixels) so take that into account. Note that the NES can do exactly the same though, so really just do the same thing and forget about it =P<br /><br />Also I was under the impression that the leftmost and rightmost <em>two</em> columns (i.e. 16 pixels each) were not safe. Then again, I'm going by Sega docs, but since the NES screen has the same width and resolution I assume it'd be the same.
