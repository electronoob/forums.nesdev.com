<br />
<br />
<br />so guys , since i used a Excitebike board which game i could put on this cart?
<br />
<br />I need to catch this part i recall there was a chart for each game which are familiar &amp; compatible
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I can't wait to try those out i will go buy a couple of mario bros Cart &amp;
<br />
<br />Other non valuable cart at my local pawn to try more.

<br />
<br />Your board is an NROM-128 though, so it will support games with only 16KB of PRG ROM. I believe you have to wire the highest address line (A14) of the chip to A14 on the cart connector.

<br />When soldering your socket in, make sure to bend up pin number 27, and solder a wire to it, and solder the other end of the wire to a place that makes contact with pin number 41 on the connector. I don't think these are connected on an NROM-128 board.
<br />
<br />This way you will be able to run ALL NROM games, 16KB or 32KB of PRG ROM. I'm saying this before you get frustrated because of the small ammount of games you'd be able to run without this mod.
<br />
<br />If you don't feel like going through the trouble of doing what I said above, just get a game with an NROM-256 board, such as SMB1.

Pin 27 on the chip is the second one, top to bottom on the right.<br /><br />The picture of the board you posted shows that the PRG chip is the one on the right, and the small identation found on top of the chips is also located on the right, meaning that the pin that goes into the second hole from right to left on the bottom row is the one you want.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">but when you say bend it is it  (on the eprom or the socket  like break the leg?)</div>
<br />Bend the socket, if you bent the chip you'd have a hard time reprogramming it! =)
<br />
<br />I'm sorry that I don't have any pics here, but it's really simple. Just bend the pin up, instead of inserting it into the hole like all others. Make sure the pin makes no contact with the board, and solder a wire to it. Then solder it to a place that makes contact with pin 41 on the connector, which,  in the picture you posted, is the 5th one from right to left, but on the other side of the board. You can follow the trace that comes out of that pin to look for the best place to solder the wire.
<br />
<br />Let me just say that I don't own an NROM-128 board, so I can't tell you I'm 100% sure of what I'm saying here. If I had this board I could quickly check if this mod would work or not, but I don't. So you better wait for someone to back me up on this! =)
<br />
<br />Ah, sice you are interested in devcarts, <a href="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/romlab/neslab.htm" class="postlink">this place</a> has a lot of info concerning them. Interesting reading material when you're learning. They have lots of pictures, and there's even has a part about programming the chips, with screenshots and all.

<br />ill get around quick ^_^
<br />Im getting over excited haha 
<br />
<br />
<br />So if i do the wire trick 
<br />
<br />
<br />what does that limit me to?
<br />
<br />Does Megaman 1 or 2 will work?
<br />
<br />or more game like SMB1 &amp; goonies.. (multi cart games) like those 100 in 1 cart  (which excitebike was on)

<br />Nope! As you guessed, NROM games are the simpler/older ones. Once you get the hang of making NROM devcarts, I suggest you make an UNROM devcart. There are many nice UNROM games, including Megaman 1, so you'll be able to run many interesting games. Plus, UNROM is pretty easy to make, it requires little rewiring and since it uses CHR-RAM, you only have to work on the PRG chip, you don't even touch the other one.
<br />
<br />What will make you able to run a great deal of games is a TxROM board. With a TKROM board you'll be able to run most MMC3 games, and the MMC3 is one of the most used mappers out there. You'd be able to run Magaman 3 and 5 with it.
<br />
<br />When you are comfortable with NROM and feel like facing some rewiring challenge, you can get some larger chips (you should really have bought some 512KB chips already!) and get to work! =)
<br />
<br />I recently got myself a TKROM board, and will soon try to make a devcart out of it. Now that I got my desoldering iron it will be much easier! =D

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This was originally in a PM to Hayabusa, but some others might be able to use this info to help split their ROM's with CajoNES (as I mentioned earlier in this thread):
<br />
<br />Here is what you do:
<br />
<br />1. Open CajoNES with the files you want to convert in the same folder.
<br />2. Type the name of the file at the prompt, like "mario.nes".
<br />3. You should see another menu with info on the rom.
<br />4. Hit F7 to export "Pasofami PRM/PRG/CHR" (the key might be different on your menu)
<br />5. Hit F9 to "Discard and Quit"
<br />
<br />That is it. You should have 3 files now, for example: mario.prm (not needed), mario.prg (for the PRG file on the cart), and mario.chr (for the CHR file on the cart).
<br />
<br />Now, depending on the file size, you may have to expand each file to fill the size of your chip (for example, let's say its 32k).
<br />
<br />If mario.chr is only 16k, then you would do the following (in DOS / from the Command Prompt):
<br />
<br />copy /b mario.chr+mario.chr mario_burn.chr
<br />
<br />That command will append binary (/b) files together into a new file. Do it as many times as needed to fill the size of the chip you're burning.
<br />
<br />Hope that helps!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think Megaman 1, 2, 4 and 6 use CHR-RAM, meaning you won't get any CHR files out of them.
<br />
<br />As I said before, when turing CHR-RAM carts into devcarts you only need to mess with one of the chips (the PRG one) and never even touch the CHR-RAM chip. That can make the whole devcart making experience less "intense", which is a good thing.
<br />
<br />But you should have told us from the start that you desire is to play Megaman 1 or 2... Did you at least buy large Flash ROMs? Such as 256KB or 512KB? If you want to play those games you really should have! =)
<br />
<br />Finding the carts to RUM those games shouldn't be hard, but you'd need to face some rewiring challenge!
<br />
<br />So, if you really plan to run those games, go buy a few carts with the same boards as the games you like (take a look at that list I posted) and order some 512KB chips. It doesn't matter if a chip is larger than the game you're putting on it, as long as all pins are wired correctly. So, with 512KB chips you can fit pretty much every NES game (using the boards you own, of course).
