<br />Seriously, though, make the correction on the thing yourself, and you'll see some interesting effects on the display, which got all messed up.  Some tiles are drawn diagonally.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />

<br />Like I said, that is an EMULATOR problem - if you want proper results, use a reliable accurate emulator.

<br />
<br />I considered that as well, but I was using FCEUXD, which runs SMB3 and Kirby's Adventure fine, but which does not seem to run this.  FCEU doesn't either.  Then again, your emulator loads it fine, as does Nesticle, LoopyNES, JNES, NNNesterJ, and I'm going to stop here.  Still, why is it not supported by FCEU and FCEUXD?  FCEUXD is based on FCEU and FCEU is well-renowned.
<br />
<br />The other comment, Disch mentioned that.  He recommended to have the interrupt start a little early.  Still, timing does seem complicated and I will eventually need to implement horizontal scrolling where I would want one part of the screen to stay put.  Any pointers on that?

<br />
<br />BTW, I have no idea how to time the $2006 writes to be within HBLANK.  Being a perfectionist, I would like to.

<br />
<br />Well, I did like two years ago.
<br />
<br />Anyway, the fact that this doesn't work on FCEU and FCEUXD makes me think there is still something wrong with the program.  Now, I wish to learn more about timing the PPU, which seems to be a thing that many here have difficulty with.
<br />
<br />I'm gonna leave in a few minutes and will be back in a few hours.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, it still doesn't work on FCEU and FCEUXD.  It shows a really messed up screen instead of showing the proper one.  SMB3 and Kirby's Adventure, which use the same IRQ's in the same mapper, run fine in the two programs.  Because of this, I am still perplexed.
