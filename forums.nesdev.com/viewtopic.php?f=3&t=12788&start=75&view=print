I'm not sure what kind of different colors you are expecting.<div class="quotetitle">r57shell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Regarding AGC. I wan't to know how I should exaclty scale voltages into IRE.]</div>There are two AGC methods used by TVs: adjust to sync, and adjust to burst. Adjust to sync is usually done for RF input, adjust to burst for baseband input. Adjust to sync means taking into account that sync tip to blanking is <em>defined</em> as 40 IRE, so measure and scale accordingly. (To be more precisely: since an RF signal is negative modulated, the sync tip will resemble the peak-to-peak amplitude.) Adjust to burst means that the color burst peak-to-peak amplitude is <em>defined</em> as 40 IRE, so measure and scale accordingly.<br />For the NES, adjusting gain according to sync will lead to a brighter than normalized picture, while adjusting to color burst will lead to a darker than normalized picture, &quot;normalized&quot; meaning you just define the NES' white level as 100 IRE (which is certainly not what any TV does, as the TV has no prior knowledge about what level is supposed to be &quot;white&quot;).<div class="quotetitle">r57shell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">How about not so old? in 1995 there was already tvs that had OSD for example.</div>Doesn't matter. Regardless of age, there is no reason for a TV to add a DC offset to <em>all three</em> R/G/B simultaneously just because one of them goes negative. Just clip negative to zero individually and be done with it.<div class="quotetitle">r57shell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I still don't get it though. Why we use linear transforms and equations for colors which are gamma precorrected. As far as I understand, they have 1/2.2 gamma, and so you have to correct them to linear first.</div>That might be correct in some abstract colorimetric sense, but NES/PAL systems are <em>defined</em> for gamma pre-corrected signals, not for some idealized signal, so transforming in linear space is wrong <em>for those</em> particular signals. (If you wanted to use abstract-idealized transformations, you would have to use different coefficients than 0.299/0.587/0.114 for current phosphor characteristics as well.)<br /><div class="quotetitle">r57shell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I thought it has only mario inside. I would like to check normal PAL TV recording.</div>I cannot seem to find the raw file of that Trappatoni picture at the moment. Attached is the only other raw PAL capture from normal TV programming that I have left. If you want, I can get out my setup and take some additional pictures.
