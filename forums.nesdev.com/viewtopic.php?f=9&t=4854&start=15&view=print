<br />
<br />Maybe the chip was never intended for other territories than Japan since it was targeting a specific sound functionality of the famicom and Nintendo had a tighter control on the american/european market?  
<br />
<br />Don't forget that in Japan they could manufacture their own carts/chips etc which was reducing the cost. But when they had to "port" the game oversea, they had to follow Nintendo policy and everything had to be produced by Nintendo (which must have increased the production cost a lot).

<br />
<br />Not necessarily, I've seen PCBs that were made by Konami and Acclaim, and I'm sure there's some examples of custom chips.  Probably it was just cheaper build it with MMC5.

<br />Like the Sunsoft chip in Batman: ROTJ.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah if Sunsoft convincted Nintendo to add the FME-7 to their official board, Konami could have convincted Nintendo to add the VRC6 as well. Extra sound would have been possible by adding a wire on the bottom expansion port, Nintendo could have been planning to sell an adaptator that would ship with some MMC5 games and plug below the NES because sound circuitry is present on NES MMC5 boards. The problem would have been that many people would sold the game used without the adaptator (when you find an used Rad Racer copy it's not likely it include glasses).
<br />
<br />Anyway I like the MMC5 version of CV3 as it is, and it's great that Konami ported the game overseas at all. They could have chosen the path they took for Gradius II, Mardara, etc... and not bother with non-japan territories.
