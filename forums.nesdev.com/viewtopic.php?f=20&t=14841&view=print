		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Doubtful.<br /><br />The board's so dense it's really hard to tell anything.<br /><br />Let's assume for the moment that the sanded-off ROM is actually a 1 MiB 'PROM instead of a 256 KiB one, and the pirates pre-expanded the fixed bank. (In the absence of two 74'08s or 74'00s, this seems likely). So there's actually 1.5 MiB of storage.<br /><br />There's a 74'574: that holds the bank. Plus a little; D6 and D7 are connected but clearly do something different. The 74'00 and 74'139 almost certainly decode some combination of address lines and the /WR strobe to make a single banking register...<br /><br />Pok√©mon Red used the <a href="http://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/MBC3" class="postlink">MBC3</a>. The pirates clearly didn't include an RTC here.<br /><br />Somehow they must have folded the 2 bits of RAM banking in with the 6 bits of ROM banking. But without any visible changes to the ROM as dumped, I have no idea how they did that. Maybe a re-dump that doesn't assume that $0000-$3FFF is fixed would cast light?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the Sanded TSOP is simply another 29LV004 chip.<br /><br />I looked at the two TSOPs more closely and they differ slightly.  Maybe chips out of different batches/revisions?  The dimensions are close but they don't appear to be exactly the same.  The legs are slightly different between the chips.  The circle that designates Pin 1 is also slightly larger and deeper on the Sanded TSOP.<br /><br />I corrected the stamp on the Sanded TSOP to &quot;Q D G F&quot;.<br /><br />The cart appears to be able to be configured in either 2M, 4M or 8M based on markings on the PCB.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my testing of the different chips appears to have corrupted the cart.  I no longer get good data when I dump it.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would have asked you to see if it responds to flash commands, like:<br />0x0555 &lt;- 0xAA<br />0x0AAA &lt;- 0x55<br />0x0555 &lt;- 0x90<br />And then reading address 0000 and 0001 and see if you get a manufacturer and device id code, as a confirmation that this cart might be reusable as a flash cart. At least the chip with the markings intact looks like a flash chip based on the marking.<br /><br />But after looking at the board, it seems that the /WR pin is pulled permanently high on the board, which means it can't see any writes. That's one of the pins in the fork like constellation next to the word 8M, and the corresponding traces on the next chip. It seems those traces are also extended below the chip to the other side to provide Vcc. If you really wanted to risk it, you could still lift the relevant pins and try it, but you would likely risk destroying at least those pins of the chip. Though I guess if you do, you still have a functioning pirate Pok√©mon cart.<br /><br />You can see the pinout in various datasheets of similar standard flash ROMs like Am29LV008B. The relevant pins to lift are WR# and RY/BY#. which you should connect to either /WR on the cart bus, or VIN on the cart. Second from the right. This is often used on flash carts to avoid letting the game access the flash chip for example for detection purposes. (When new games were still being released.) The other pin you're recommended to lift and just leave unconnected is RY/BY# which would go low during flash chip erase/write operations, which would short Vcc to ground, depending on the strength of the transistor used for that function. Not ideal.<br /><br />Note: The chip is what is listed as standard TSOP in the datasheet of Am29LV008B, not reverse TSOP and the chip is placed &quot;upside down&quot; when looking at the board as in the pictures.<br />Note 2: /WR and WR# mean the same thing. They just different notations for an active low signal.
