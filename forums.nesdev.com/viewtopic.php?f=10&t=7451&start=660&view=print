Patching code like that with fixes you don't know why they work instead of fixing it will make bad code quickly that's harder to manage.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Something I just thought of, (and I feel bad especially after harping so much to use temp RAM) is that you probably should not be using temp RAM in draw_sprite because that's run during your NMI. 
<br />
<br />If something that's not in your NMI uses those variables, and then the NMI interrupts and changes them before that something is done, bad things can happen.
<br />
<br />But, something big I haven't seen must be up for the A button press thing. I can't even think of a theory for that one.
<br />
<br />Edit: But I can say this. You've essentially got a check to make sure aFrame isn't an unsafe value. I can think of two things that aren't too great about how you're doing it. 
<br />
<br />One: You never fix aFrame if it's out of bounds!
<br />Two: It's probably better to check/fix aFrame near whatever code actually updates its value.
<br />
<br />I don't think doing so would fix your problem, but I do think it makes more sense.

<br />Now... I think I'll have to rewrite my scrolling code... when you rewrite code do you have to be prevented from thinking about the code you already wrote? I'm confused <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> ...and tired... to sleep. Good morning to yall. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />   Guh have to be up in 15 minutes... we'll be off to New Orleans.

<br />No. You can keep in mind what you think worked so the process goes faster. But as you reimplement each small part, verify it works exactly as expected before moving on. 
<br />
<br />When it doesn't, you'll generally have much fewer things it could be, because everything you wrote before should work. It was already checked.

This means whatever draw_sprite is writing will only appear during the <em>NEXT</em> vblank. <br /><br />Edit: Hmm...
