It's just so much better to use the compiler as a library instead. You can interface with the assembler through function calls instead of being forced to pipe stuff between processes for example. Not sure if CC65 even supports exporting the parse tree which is necessary to get the new features such as sentence completion and tool tip.

Great progress <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'd really like to use it more but for the last couple of projects I've done I've moved over to CC65 and I don't really have a desire to go back to ASM6 (I still do use it for quick tests as it's a little more ready-to-go than CC65).<br /><br />Is there not the possibility to throw the assembly out to the command line (in the background) so that you don't have to build ASM6 into the tool? I think this is the way modern IDE's work (Xcode on Mac definitely). That way you could practically have Nesicide use <em>any</em> assembler.<br /><br />If you want further proof, look at the "Assembler Of Choice" poll on here <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3896">neilbaldwin</a> — Fri Jan 28, 2011 1:21 am</p><hr />

I have updated <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nesicide.com">www.nesicide.com</a><!-- w --> with an installer (setup.msi) for NESICIDE in Windows.  I'm also going to work on a build/release for Linux.<br /><br />This is not an official release...I think if I ever get around to doing an official release the world just might come to an end!  I just wanted to pop back in and say "still here" to those of you that might have thought "that NESICIDE guy...whatever happened to him?"<br /><br /><a href="http://nesicide.com/?s=download" class="postlink">Get it here</a><br /><br />Notables in the "release":<br /><br />Code Editor:<br />The source code editors are completely integrated with the emulator and will soon be integrated with various debuggers.  Breakpoints and marker regions can be set in actual source code.  Source code can be stepped through.  ToolTips provide useful information such as instruction/addressing mode guidance, symbol locations and values (if a compile has taken place).  Sentence completion is provided for assembly mnemonics and symbols declared up to the last compile.  [I'll be working on a background-JIT-compiler to keep the sentence completion engine and ToolTip engine up-to-date with written code].  Sentence completion will soon include expression completion, suggesting expressions relevant to the addressing modes available for the assembly mnemonic preceeding the expression you started typing.<br /><br />Project complexity:<br />I have been able to construct a project that consists of several distinct source files and compile them together into a ROM that uses MMC1 mapper.  I've also been able to successfully compile and run SMB1 from the smbdis.asm and "borrowed" CHR-ROM data.  The compiler is an ASM6 remake, so ASM6 syntax *should* work.  I'd love to get bug reports <a href="http://mantis.nesicide.com" class="postlink">here</a> if you find problems!<br /><br />Debuggers:<br />There haven't been many additions here, I've been mainly focused on tool internal mechanics, project management, and code editing features.  I will say this, though, I'm itching to get back into "debugger" mode and bang out a few more useful debuggers and make the ones that are there already even more useful.<br /><br />Emulator:<br />I've amassed a whopping 160+ test ROMs in my GIT repository, of which I've managed to get 146 to pass so far.  I'm also itching to get back to making this part of the tool more accurate!  The installer also includes nesicide-emulator.exe which is just the emulator running by itself without all the IDE baggage.  [Yes, in the IDE the emulator's performance suffers a bit due to all the debugger interaction...]<br /><br />Here's a <a href="http://nesicide.com/nesicidedemo.zip" class="postlink">video</a> of me playing around a bit...forgot to show the sentence completion though!
