		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just received the AV Famicom I bought on eBay, and I'm loving it. It certainly is the best official NES/FC console ever released. The video quality is the best I've ever seen from composite video.<br /><br />The only downside is it doesn't take 72-pin cartridges, so I still need a decent solution for those. I do have a 72-&gt;60 pin  converter, but it's a cheap chinese bare PCB one that doesn't make me comfortable (carts are not steady enough, the PCB could ne too thick and damage the slot, whatever).<br /><br />Ideally, I'd mod my top-loader to have it output composite video, but there are so many different mods out there and there's always people complaining that none of them are perfect that it's hard to keep up with them.<br /><br />Can anyone tell me the current status of top-loader AV mods? Is there a particular mod known to make the video as good as that of an AV Famicom?<br /><br />I don't want to risk damaging my console testing different methods just to realize none of the mods are very good.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just anecdotal commentary, maybe a bit to make tokumaru feel better too:<br /><br />I own a Famicom AV, a top-loader NES, and a front-loader NES.  I've also owned many original Famicoms over the years.<br /><br />The Famicom AV is the best of the bunch, hands down.  The picture looks wonderful (for composite), and has none of the issues that the top-loader NES has.  I wouldn't mod my Famicom AV if someone paid me to -- it's just fine how it is.  It's what I mainly use for 60-pin carts.<br /><br />My top-loader NES (RF-only of course) has <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=601" class="postlink">the infamous &quot;vertical jailbars&quot; problem</a> and there isn't a single post in that thread that provide a full, definitive explanation for the problem -- or a definitive fix.  All I see in that thread are a lot of people &quot;screwing around&quot; with some success, while others try the same technique and it doesn't work for them.  Because the top-loader NES tends to cost a lot of money, I don't want to mod the thing unless I have an absolute 100% definitive way of fixing the &quot;jailbar&quot; problem.  So this unit mainly sits in storage for me.  The best thing that came with it was the dogbone controller, honestly.  Shame on Nintendo for getting rid of the composite video + RCA audio jacks.  I really do wish I could send the thing back to them and have them replace it with an updated PCB that fixes the jailbars (there are rumours of that floating around the web + this forum, I think).  :/<br /><br />My front-loader NES (using composite) has no visual problems whatsoever, and it's what I mainly use for 72-pin carts.  The only downside is, of course, the shoddy cartridge slot (it has a new contact connector on it, but as has been determined, the replacements are often *too* tight, and result in problems -- I can attest to this fact).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't <em>know</em> the &quot;right&quot; way to do it, but I would start with:<br />Re-implement the frontloader's video pathway, using dedicated wires (from the regulator) for power supply rails, bypass capacitors, and coaxial cable. If there's still PPU noise coupled in, maybe give the PPU a dedicated power rail and/or regulator.<br /><br />The reverse-engineered Electronix corp schematic seems to indicate it's just a pair of PNP and NPN common-emitter current buffers, but.

Cartridges can't be inserted all the way in one of them, which isn't a problem for regular cartridges, but it's enough to prevent me from locking down the PowerPak, which has a little bit of the CF card sticking out. Also, both of them are PAL-M, which probably wouldn't be a problem if the video was generated that way, but since it's converted from NTSC there appears to be some degradation. There was a third front loader, which I killed trying to convert to back NTSC.

If the mod you're referring to is what tokumaru tried -- because if it is, it sounds like it's not worth me doing,<br /><br />2. What capacitor you're referring to (give me the silkscreening label of it on the board, and a picture of the board + its location circled),<br /><br />3. What replacement capacitor you're referring to (&quot;beefier&quot; tells me nothing -- I want type (e.g. electrolytic vs. film vs. ceramic), specs (both microfarad and voltage), and if polarity matters),<br /><br />That's it.  Anything else I'm not willing to try, sorry to say.  I can solder and do general boardwork without issue, but it really has to be laid out clearly for me.  I'm not an EE guy, but I can do some simple EE &quot;things&quot; as long as they're documented clearly.

Or both, or how much of each of both.<br /><br />Btw, koitsu, did you ever get the translation you mentioned in the <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=119031#p119031" class="postlink">preceding post</a> ?

He does technical documentation as a career so his tech vocabulary is pretty vast.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I want to add a few things to this thread that might help someone make a decision if they stumble upon it in the future:<br /><br />1) the original toaster isn't perfect either.  I can see faint jailbars on my Sony HDTV when I connect to it via composite.  Those bars aren't there if I connect to CRT.<br /><br />2) NESRGB is hands down the best video one can get from a Nintendo system.  You don't have to go the RGB route.  So you can do composite, Svideo or component (using cheap RGB to component converters).  There are no faint jail bars and any other artifacts.  The only flaw with NESRGB is cost and availability.<br /><br />3) The root cause of the jail bars on the top loader is known.  It's the pin 21 traces being too close to other lines.
