		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />does the dma timer get reloaded with LUT[$4010 &amp; f] each time it becomes zero or only when a cycle is restarted when bits remaining becomes 0 ?  such that it would use the old value in $4010 till the end of the cycle when bits remaining becomes 0.
<br />
<br />i started writing some tests here, but not sure how useful they would be to anyone as they are very basic at the moment.  i could probably write a useful test but dont have any way of runnning it on the real hardware.  for now i compared to other emulators.  for example irq timing, assuming its exact and dma is 4 cycles.  i have a long segment of nop so i can watch the program counter.   i have read that sometimes dma is not 4 cycles.   i have read that does not seem to be instruction related and perhaps odd/even cycles.
<br />
<br />if a dmc dma occurs during a sprite dma, i assume that dmc interrupts sprite ?  i think that was tested and no audio problems.  if it does interrupt it, how many cycles does the total dma take ?  i think that might be easy to test.
<br />
<br />if the dmc is silenced, and some time later it is started, when will the first dma occer ?  immdiatly or N cycles later ?
<br />
<br />i dont expect all these to be answered yet; if they can not be then what can be doen to find out.  i had some ideas for testing, but would like others input first.
<br />
<br />also if something is not exact or unknown, then perhaps a test to verify an accepted range ?
<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The DMC's bit timer reloads every time it expires. Every 8 bits a new byte cycle is started, either the sample byte in the buffer, or silence if it's empty. The DMA unit merely runs whenever the sample byte buffer becomes empty.
<br />
<br />I've done conclusive tests and DMC DMA is 4 cycles if it interrupts a 6502 read cycle, 3 cycles if it interrupts a write cycle. The other timing details aren't known. The simplest way I have in mind is to write tests that require exact timing, then adjust an emulator until it passes, and examine what the emulator is doing. I probably won't work on this for a while though.
