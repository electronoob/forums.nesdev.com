<br />
<br />I know Martin (site owner + Famicom/NES collector) has made some similar labels in the past (mainly just images for the 'net though), so he might be able to shed some light on the matter.
<br />
<br />Admittedly, I don't see how this can be all that difficult.  Getting high-quality scans of some of the standardised crap (i.e. Nintendo's seal of approval) really isn't that hard.  Scan, apply a couple default Photoshop filters, clean up some of the borders/edges, adjust brightness/contrast to make up for scanner quality, and voila.

<br />That might get you in trouble with the law. The "Official Nintendo Seal" is a trademark. It'd be better for someone to design a custom nesdev seal that can be used on any program developed in the homebrew community that has been successfully tested on NES hardware.

<br />Somehow I doubt Nintendo is going to go after people re-creating NES cart labels, compared to people distributing ROM images.  Both "might" get you in trouble with the law, but Nintendo isn't likely going to chase after cart label makers (especially when it's not for commercial use) when they're more interested in ROM kiddies.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I personally made my own label for my FF2 card.
<br />It it of slightly lower quality than normal labels, however. I downloaded a picture of the FF2 label (from the wonderswan version), paste it in photoshop or whatever picture-editing too, and also pasted the seal of quality, Squaresoft logo and Nintendo logo (all of these are from the net), and manually added text "European Version" and "NES-FY-FRA" that would simulate the cartridge's ID code. (I show picture of the real label where the real code was something like SQU-FY or something).
<br />Then I printed it, and after several tries to have right dimensions, cutted it and pasted it on the card on the original Zelda label.
<br />But the labels on that site are way better than mine.
