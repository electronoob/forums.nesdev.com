Yep, that's something they addressed in Vista/7, although the bug itself is purely the result of some kind of off-by-one bug in GDI/GDI+ itself but only seems to affect *some* WM_PAINT bits.  &quot;Install East Asian languages&quot; in XP messes with some crazy stuff GDI-wise.</div><br /><br />The same bugs occurs in the Japanese build of Windows XP (since there is no single distribution like vista/7). I have been using winXP in Japanese for many years now and I didn't know that it was related to this! I thought it was a normal winXP bug. <br /><br />For now I will try to finish rebuilding by computer with XP/Lion/linux. I finally decided to try mint, got interested in it. I will try Cinnamon first then install XFCE.

Windows 7 shouldn't have any problem with Japanese file names at all. The only time I had an issue like you mentioned was more related with compressed file and the archiver or archive itself had issue.  There are many Japanese encoding which can cause some program to fail (JIS and its many variants, shift-jis, EUC-JP, unicode) and the fun thing is that there is no 100% way to detect which one it is programatically! (I had to deal with that problem once)

Awesome.  What a cluster.<br /><br />The only other thing I can think of is possibly if you install extra fonts on the system somehow, and one of them advertises a Unicode Japanese character set (I forget which code pages those are), when in fact it lacks one.  I've seen fonts like this before.

Furthermore, I'm inclined to think nobody is going to sit through a damn tutorial, given that Microsoft's tutorials in the past (the one on XP in particular) taught the user absolutely nothing about anything.  Finally, I imagine if there was a tutorial, that the author of the video would have taken the time to read it/follow it, or if not, at least mention it.<br /><br />All the points you make in your /. posts are completely legit; usability has gone down the shitter.  I absolutely refuse to believe Microsoft had &quot;over a million hours put in to usability testing&quot;.  Just absolute nonsense.  But then again, I also haven't purchased Windows 8, so I guess that nullifies my opinion completely.  Gotta spend money to have an opinion, thus increasing the &quot;Windows 8 sales percentage&quot; numbers.  Hmm, how about this instead: no thanks.  :D
