<br />Still looks awesome! (but I kinda miss the C64-like appearance of the earlier previews ;p)

<br />How does that get rendered fast enough?

<br />
<br />Anyway, about the latest mock-up, here's what it might look like through an NES PPU. Notice the jagged edges at the sides of the trees and the somewhat broken appearance of the empty hearts in the status bar.

<br />
<br />And about palette changes to reflect power-ups: Super Mario Bros. 3 shows the hero's tailed form by changing the shape with the same palette. Super Mario Land 2 and the Wario Land series show powerups as hats.

<br />
<br />The orange palette is too similar to the fire palette, so the overall impression is that you gave up on a lot of collors just for this effect. Also, because of the subtle difference, it will be hard to tell whether the orange dragon has the fire power-up or not.
<br />
<br />Another problem with this color scheme is that when both dragons have the same power-up it will be really hard to tell them apart, since they aren't that different from each other.

<br />I believe these are better options to indicate power-ups. Or icons in the status bar, like in <em>Kirby's Adventure</em>.

The green dragon would turn blue and use ice and the orange one would turn deep red to use fire.  They would be selectable at the start as to which one Player 1 would want to be.  If both are playing then, like LittleBigPlanet, there would be small areas that both players have to co-operate to gain access to and often do it by combining their abilities.  Such as setting fire to a particular obstacle and then using ice to put out the flames and clear the path.  So niether dragon would ever be the same color as each other.   And I didn't waste colors like you say, I needed a sort of orange range for sprites that could be 'woody' or 'rocky' but still needed the red/yellow for fire effects and to me they certainly look different enough to be clearly recognisible while being just similar enough that I can flicker between the two for the flames to give them a nice effect.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And about palette changes to reflect power-ups: Super Mario Bros. 3 shows the hero's tailed form by changing the shape with the same palette.

<br />
<br />I always found the hats to just look tacky and icons in the status panel is boring (in Kirby I only liked the power ups that gave him something fun to use such as the sword). As for 'changing the shape' there isn't much room in a 16x16 sprite to do a lot to it and I've no idea what fire or ice powers would do to a dragon's shape that could work in that small an area or make any sense.   
<br />
<br />I'll have to think about it but I'm pretty busy with training and rehearsals for the next week or two so won't be about much.  By the way that TV-like filtered image seems alright.  I prefer sharp clean pixels (with or without scanlines) but yeah it's nice to see how it might have looked on a real NES plugged into TV.
<br />
<br />Anyways seeya sometime <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Thanks for all the help.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just a lil post before I head off to say I've tinkered more with the Player 2 palette and after using light brown (which worked fine on wood but made the dragon look like a turd) I've gone a different route and used pink which seems fitting for a girl dragon and looks significantly different to the fire palette so she clearly upgrades.  Also it gives a bit more color to the levels too with the pink gems and flowers and enemies.
<br />
<br />Because of the new pink some of the things had to be removed from that palette such as the chicken but then it hit me that because of the use of black added from using those dark faraway trees I can swap more things from sprites to background tiles.  For example the chicken is now a tile using the wood/rock browns and has a solid black background which means I can put it anywhere which would be black or mostly black anyways.  Can do the same when I want to add lots of coins as background tiles.
<br />
<br />Ok I'm gone.  Seeya soon, folks <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

Super Mario Bros. 3 (MMC3) does this with its status bar, as do many RPGs. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />You can also change some palette colors, but AFAIK this can cause glitches if not done properly.

<br />
<br />In Super Mario 1, if Luigi gets a fire flower, he is indistinguishable from firey Mario.  I always thought that was annoying to no end.
<br />
<br />So if you are going to change which palette a character is using, I would suggest that you make it blink between their normal colors and the "I have fire" palette, so you can still tell which character is which.
