We are looking to develop at first a small test level of a game concept that we have planned out and then expand to build a full fledged game.<br /><br />After wandering through reddit and several other pages we stumbled this amazing forum full of talented people, we've been looking at it for a while and now decided to pose.<br /><br /><strong>A bit about the game :</strong><br />The game is asidescroller with simple Double Dragon like combat system and movement ( with some elements of River City Ranoms ) . All graphics have been and will be prepared by us we simply need the game programmed in 6502 and able to work in an NES cartridge / emulator.<br /><br />We're looking to hire a programmer who is capable of doing this on a contract.<br /><br />If you have any questions feel free to ask! We can be contacted here via PM , <em>admin (at) twocoins (dot ) net</em> , and through skype at<em> TwoCoinsEntertainment </em>.<br /><br /><img src="http://s23.postimg.org/a0qha0icn/Hero_Standing.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://s30.postimg.org/bxpysvmhp/Hero_Punch_Combo_Ghost_Poof_Centered_Gray_Animation.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://s22.postimg.org/mjipbsuox/School_Level_7_Revised_Guides_1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />If this is wrong section I apologize in advance!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just first things first, someone is going to point out that a lot of the graphics will have to be modified to respect attribute table restrictions, sprites per scanline limitations, number of colors per tile, and color choice (choosing from the NES's palette). If you haven't already, I would strongly familiarize yourself with the NES's restrictions and library of examples to make it easier to create art for it.<br /><br />I see six unique colors on your character. It is not impossible to create this using two sets of overlaid sprites (a la Mario is Missing for NES) but that will quickly eat into your sprite limit which is already a huge issue for beat-em-up games that have multiple characters on one line at a time. Plus, that's already two palettes used out of the four sprite ones available.

If there's anything so far that screams beyond capacity then I'm happy to adjust accordingly. I tried to familiarise myself as best as possible, I'll keep studying into it to make sure I'm on the right track while finding a programmer

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I played around with redrawing your sprite, optimized for NES. Specifically, reducing color usage, positioning color transitions to fit sprite palette limitations, and implementing a tiny bit of overlaid sprites for mario 2 - style eye whites. This is prioritized so the white overlaid parts would begin to flicker first, and the resulting image isn't too jarring (even if the eyes are totally hidden there are simpler eyes behind them to fall back on)<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/APe0L4F.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Let me know if you are interested in any audio or NES graphics work.

Also looking at that makes me wonder if it's really worth doing the overlaying, the face without overlay already looks pretty good in my opinion, and I bet the shirt could be easily adjusted if needed.

The second problem I see is that people who are trying to hire coders often underestimate the amount of work that goes into creating something for the NES, and probably give up when they realize how much it'd actually cost.<br /><br />I believe that for an arrangement like this to really work, the coder would have to be a little more involved with the project, so that some of the work would be done out of passion, rather than it being just about the money.

Makes sense when your palette has 15 colors, but when it only has 3 and few palettes it becomes an issue in my opinion.
