<br />The plastic shield is probably a safety precaution to prevent kids from removing the snap-cover and licking the EXP Port connector…
<br />
<br />In other news, I expect to have further updates next week. I have been catching up on customer orders now that I am mostly recovered from my injuries.

<br />Oh right, yeah, that makes sense. It's always good to childproof toys. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

<br />Of course it will have a use. On #nesdev yesterday, we were talking about development for <a href="http://playpower.org/" class="postlink">Playpower Foundation's famiclone</a>. The conversation went roughly like this:
<br />
<br />&lt;someone&gt; you should target authentic Nintendo hardware and not NOAC famiclones
<br />&lt;someone2&gt; famiclones are still manufactured; NES isn't
<br />&lt;someone&gt; anyone serious about playing NES games will buy a used NES and a 72-pin connector on eBay
<br />&lt;someone2&gt; this famiclone has a keyboard and can run Family Basic; NES doesn't and can't
<br />&lt;someone&gt; then buy a Famicom keyboard on eBay and buy Xious's expansion port adapter

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you are going to quote me, please be accurate. I said that I had ideas of my own and would be making expansion devices, plus selling the connectors. I did not say what they were, but a DA-15 expansion is one of them, as you may piece together by my asking for DA-15 port sources. 
<br />
<br />The hardest part of the DA-15 EXP connector is casing. I have to decide if I want a cable with a female port, of an under-shell, which will magnify the cost. 
<br />
<br />Another idea is a special sound expansion card, and another project for which I will need the help of others. I need some good VERILOG programmers… Is Loopy still around, or Brian/Bunnyboy?
<br />
<br />The latter project is confidential, but if it materializes, will be amazing.
<br />
<br />What I asked is if anybody has good ideas for expansion devices, as I can't think of everything and I value useful input. 
<br />
<br />As of this week, I am waiting for a second set of samples. The gal that is working with me to produce the connectors was on vacation all of last week, and this is taking longer than I expected, but things arte definitely progressing.
<br />
<br />The first batch of connectors didn’t fit because I mis-measured the thickness of the edge connector on the EXP port. They have the right outer size and pin configuration, but the gutter is too tight. 
<br />I modified one to make it fit, but it's ugly and I want them to be perfect.
