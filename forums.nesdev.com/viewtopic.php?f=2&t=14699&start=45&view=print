I am working on a new database driven system for the main domain and will replace that static page when it is ready. a couple lines of CSS will make it more table like for bigger screens and similar to how it currently is on smaller screens.

I personally did not want to try out the ads or donations and felt strange in doing so... but it has worked out well. the new parts should start arriving tomorrow and i should have the new server built Wednesday night. hopefully i can get it in place either this Friday or the following Monday.

Other stuff on the page should also be given its own ID in case the user wishes to hide or move (or resize) them, such as the style buttons when writing a message, colours when writing a message, etc. (If you want, you could give them a new ID each time a new donation campaign starts, so that the user will see each one at least once. If you want it both ways (hide it permanently, and hide it only per campaign), assign it both a class and a ID!)
