		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hello anyone,
<br />      o.k. Ive prepped my demo with cajones.  i burned my .prg and .chr files to (2) AT29c256 chips im using.  
<br />
<br />Nothing Just a grey screen:(
<br />
<br />I then took out the chips from an xevious cart and put them my Ex-Kung Fu Proto Cart Sockets to check if it was my soldering job, but Xevious runs just fine.
<br />
<br />The Chips Burn Just fine on my Williem Programmer.  I read somewhere that  i need to copy my, for example, my PRG file.  over and over until it fills all the 256 space im using.  is this true????  any ideas???
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />el
<br />
<br />P.S. Ive cut pin 4 of the CIC in the NES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Remember that the numbers that are part of the chip's names indicate it's size in Kbits, not KBytes. This means that the AT29C256 can hold 32 KBytes. If your data is smaller than that, yes, it is a good idea to replicate it to fill the whole space.
<br />
<br />This isn't actually necessary when you wire all the pins correctly (the higher address lines in particular), but you're better safe than sorry.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Have you tried burning a commercial game in those chips? If that works, you can rule out issues with the programmer, and start looking for issues with your demo.

<br />
<br />I have no options for shorting pins though... But does that even matter in your case? The chips you are using have 28 pins, right? Is pin 32 of the socket even used?

<br />
<br />
<br />i found out that my ZIF32 Pin error im getting has to do with the pinouts.  it when i select my chip 29c256 there is already one with a 32 pin template.  there an section on the wlliem programmer that lets you check of which pins you want to use.    any ideas???  
<br />
<br />p.s.  no its not the programmer.  i shelled out another 60 buck to buy the most recent one (  4.5)  with still no results. 
<br />
<br />thanks

<br />
<br />I've programmed 29C256's with my Willem without any problems... I don't understand what you're saying about "32 pin template"... Is that because the Willem has a 32-pin ZIF socket and the chip has only 28 pins and you don't know exactly where to place it? I really can't remember if you have to align it to the top or to the bottom of the socket, but doesn't the software tell you that?

<br />
<br />However, I remember seeing that screen and I didn't have to do anything with it. Some tabs present you some complex things to setup, but normally you don't have to do anything, just selecting the type of the chip does the job. Just set the switches on the board as indicated in the software, fill the buffer with the file you want to put in the chip and tell it to program. That's how I have always done it.
<br />
<br />A separate paper sheet came with my programmer though, and it described a couple of jumper settings for the different AT29C chips. I remember having to move the jumpers around when I switched between 29C256 and 29C040 chips. Did you get one of those paper sheets? I think there was also a PDF file in the CD with the same information.
