		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have decided to use packbits for my nametable compression.  I have learned the basics about scrolling and I'm really glad to see that it isn't as difficult as I thought.<br /><br />I am working on a basic horizontal scrolling game (one way).<br /><br />The thing is, I had an idea of what to do for updating the name-tables as you scrolled.  I imagine you would switch the bit that changes writes to $2007 from 1-byte to 32-bytes.  With a standard nametable structure - as in 1 byte per 8x8 tile - I could easily run my updates based on the ratio of scrolling times.<br /><br />However, using packbits makes this more complicated.  I was hoping someone could explain how and when to perform updates to the nametables as scrolling occurs.  Are there any standard coding examples for this?<br /><br />I have so much work to do with sprites, music, ai, collision detection, etc.  I don't want to get bogged down with scrolling if I don't have to. <br /><br />Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Put your decompressed next nametable piece to a buffer in a piece of RAM at $100 (You can use other places, but PLA STA is great for a little unrolling). Then decompress the next update to the screen outside of vblank into the buffer. It's not too bad at all. Honestly, that compression is simple enough you can probably do it in VBlank completely if you don't want to/can't use a buffer. I'd say it's worth buffering, though. Here's a decompressor to the PPU with the format (MMMM.RRRR) where M is the metatile number and R is the repeat count for it. You'll need to add a bit to it and it probably doesn't work as I JUST wrote it, but it may help others see how they can do it/what needs to happen.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">MetatileataArrayFormat: UPPER RIGHT TILE,BOTTOM RIGHT TILE,UPPER LEFT TILE, BOTTOM LEFT TILE. ;16 times for 16 tiles.<br /><br />ZPNTData: 2 bytes zeropage ;Zeropage pointer to nametable stream.

I've never wrote a game that scrolls during playing, but I've messed with scrolling regs a ton. If anyone else (preferably who have written a scrolling game) got any comments on this decompressor, please speak up. I'd love to know where I can improve my programming. (Despite, in this case, I'd probably use a buffer instead of doing the code above in vblank.)
