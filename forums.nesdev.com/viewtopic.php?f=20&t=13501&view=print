		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got an urge to check out what's going on in the gameboy homebrew world today and, it looks like a lot of things are somewhat falling by the wayside or not updated as much as in the NES world---or I just don't know where to look, yet. Is there anything as interesting as a full-size platformer game or RPG going on in the gameboy world? Is there anybody who can produce cart plastics and boards for the system? I'd like to see that happen some day. I'm not sure when or if I'd do it myself, but, the game boy is amongst the systems I hold very dear from my childhood..it certainly deserves a homebrew scene as vibrant as the NES's.<br /><br />The only things I've found are:<br />-a variety of very old emulators<br />-gambatte emulator (seems more up to date, in use on mobile devices these days)<br />-gbdk (old)<br />-rgbasm (somewhat more up to date?)<br />-everdrive gb<br />-a few random tutorials from more than 10 years ago (asmschool, gdbk's examples, and game boy devrs...which seems to have some updates from this year, but all the code there is from 15 years ago or so in most cases)<br /><br />...so now I find myself obsessively mirroring any information I can find about GB dev locally in case its all gone by the time I have the motivation to build a game for it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I'm currently working on a DMG demo for the 20th anniversary of Pokemon (in the US at least, already 20 in Japan). Depending on how comfortable I get with GB development, I might want to jump into homebrew.<br /><br />I'm interested in a Golden Sun-type RPG for the GBC (lots of animation during battle) but who knows if/when I'll get the time...<br /><br />I'm very interested in making physical carts, at least for limited runs. Making a manual + box would be great too. I can fogure out that part (used to work in a print shop, still got connections) but I have no idea where to go about the carts themselves.

My creative strong-point is writing stories (and code), not music, but I can wring some decent tunes every now and then. The problem is time for me. I'm busy getting into DS emulation, a sci-fi novel, and this demo project. There'd be nothing &quot;little&quot; about trying to make an RPG <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> It'd be a huge time-sink to say the least, but that's what dreams are for, or something like that.<br /><br />It'd be cool if I could get just a portion done, just to give people a taste of &quot;what could be&quot;. Kind of like how some games start <em>in media res</em>, giving you a cast of leveled up characters at the start (like the 1st Lufia on the SNES) and having you fight some enemies, then a boss before the game really &quot;begins&quot;. That much would be doable and fun.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I spent the evening reading through those old &quot;asmschool&quot; tutorials, at least what was ever completed of them. Nice little intro. It seems like there's a lot of things somewhat similar to the NES, just arranged differently. I liked that the video ram was mapped directly to the cpu rather than having to indirectly talk to a ppu through a few registers as on the NES. I imagine that makes certain things a bit easier...! There actually seems to be quite a wealth of info out there and even a debugging emulator. So it seems like there's no shortage of tools or information to get started. Probably not quite as hand holding as the NES scene has become (that is not a bad thing), but...I think I can work with it, at this point. It also appears there's a common music player called blackbox that one could leverage.

Looks like I have some work to do!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />...I mean there are things you can compose with that work on the GB itself, but...for game dev, I'd want something super convenient like FamiTracker, and a corresponding driver suitable for games. This always seems to be the first big hurdle for homebrew game dev.

Looks like it may have a pretty steep learning curve. FamiTracker is so great because you can start using it even if you know jack squat---I did back in 2008 when I got into NES coding...now I feel like I can write halfway decent music with it. But with this thing...I'm poring over the instructions...got it to make a sound, but now it won't play my song <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Maybe someday I'll make something like FT for gameboy. Really makes you feel an ultra sense of gratitude for all the hard work that went into making NES arguably one of the most inviting retro consoles to make games for!

It appears to have a nice ui that works with the keyboard and mouse. True gameboy sound preview. MIDI input, which is a must for me (I like to use my nanokey2!). And finally, they provide a detailed file format for their module format and instrument format. That proably gets me 80% of the way there, now I need to learn the gameboy sound hardware and write a nice little lite sound engine for games <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
