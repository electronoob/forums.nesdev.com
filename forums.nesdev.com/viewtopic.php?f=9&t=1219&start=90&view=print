<br />Currently, we believe the SRAM to be x4bit, and therefore we're looking for a 4bit MCU.  I don't know what the C80C means, but I have looked at chips that I KNOW what they are ... and they often have letters/numbers displayed prominently that I can't figure out what they are for.   So it may mean nothing of use for us.  But who knows?
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Searching for "4-bit MCU" I found this:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.winbond-usa.com/products/winbond_products/pdfs/4-bit/W541C20X.pdf">http://www.winbond-usa.com/products/win ... 41C20X.pdf</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I've never seen a feature like this before:
<br />"2048 x 16 bit program ROM (including 2K x 4 bit look-up table)"
<br />
<br />Which seems to suggest that the instructions are 12bit and an extra 4 bits are tacked on as a separate table (ie. no need for an extra set of row selects on the chip). The diagrams in the PDF seem to support this, but I didn't see anything that explicitly said one way or the other.
<br />
<br />If this feature is not rare, then maybe the Tengen device has 8-bit opcodes with 4-bit data table on it.  Or, maybe there is no data table ... and the Winbond product may "match up" as a 4-bit MCU with 12-bit.

It is two separate considerations "What core suits us best?" and "What company can make this for us cheapest?".   I don't know much about how such decisions are made in the industry now, let alone back in 1989.  But it may be foolish to limit ourselves to Motorola CPU cores.
<br />
<br />If anyone works with IC design, or has friends that do ... could you ask your contacts about the likelyhood of it being a Motorola core?
<br />
<br />
<br />Until then, everyone, please point out any 4-bit cores with 12bit instruction words.  I recently found this one:

<br />
<br />I guess it comes down to: 
<br />1] Would it be necessary / worth the hassle, effort, time, and money to make their own core? 
<br />2] Did Tengen have someone on staff that had the skills necessary to design their own core?
<br />
<br />I don't think we have enough inside info to answer such questions.  But it worries me that we are even asking them now.   
<br />
<br />How do you suggest we continue?  Is there some way we can verify or eliminate this as an option?
<br />
<br />We really need to get ahold of someone that used to work for Tengen.  I don't know how to track them down though.

<br />I have never seen one of these in a cart.  How are the pins connected?  There seem to be many more used pins on the IC than necessary.

<br />
<br />-------------
<br />Center logic:
<br />
<br />I'm not convinced this is the ALU.  Notice that the ROM output ONLY goes to the center logic.  I'm guessing this is part of the operation decoding, and that the upper logic is the ALU.
<br />
<br />But then the SRAM lines also go only to the center logic ... so I don't know.  It doesn't make sense to me yet.
<br />
<br />------------
<br />"RC" circuits:
<br />
<br />Yeh, I noticed those three things that look kind of like RC circuits.  Notice that the resistor is actually in the diffusion layer... an interesting way to make a resistor.  Also notice that the capacitor seems to be between the polysilicon and the diffusion layer... I guess that is where the oxide layer is thinnest, so it makes sense.
<br />
<br />I have trouble believing those are for oscillator circuits though.  The CIC is supplied with a clock.  I think it is more likely to be for making a Schmitt trigger for the reset logic or something.  But then I don't know why you'd need a capacitor for that.  Or maybe it is for rejecting "glitch" pulses on some of the input lines.  I don't know ... until I can trace this out better, it just doesn't make much sense.
<br />
<br />Here's a schematic for a CMOS Schmitt trigger:

<br />I've never seen the base left unconnected for an FET in a diagram before.  What exactly does that mean for those four transistors?
<br />
<br />
<br />----------
<br />
<br />I'm not sure where to start in reverse engineering this thing.  How about we try to figure out the pin connections on the silicon?  That should hopefully be simple enough.

<br />It is encoded in the diffusion layer.  If they don't run the n-type up to the polysilicon row line, then as a "transistor" it can't ever be turned on.
<br />
<br />
<br />For example: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/tengen2/tengen2_030.jpg">http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/tengen2/tengen2_030.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />In this picture, the outer eight row lines (polysilicon) here can never "switch on" the connection between those "squares" (the bit line connection points) and ground. 
<br />
<br />Whereas in this example: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/tengen2/tengen2_031.jpg">http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/tengen2/tengen2_031.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />You can see many places where the n-type diffusion layer does butt up against the polysilicon line, so it can act as a transistor.
<br />
<br />Does that help some?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since I often get messages asking what the pictures mean, this is probably a good place to pause to explain how to read the pictures.  (Kevtris, I'll return to your question in a bit.  I kind of got sidetracked.)
<br />
<br />
<br />All the devices we will be looking at are silicon CMOS devices.  This means all the transistors will be FETs.  It is not necessary to understand all the details of how the transistor works to be able to "read" these pictures.  Here are the basics:
<br />
<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Doped Semiconductors</span></strong>
<br />Pure silicon is not a good conductor, but by putting very small amounts of "impurities" (dopants) in it, it can be made to conduct much better.  The amount needed is amazingly small (the number of dopant atoms per silicon atoms can be numbered as parts per billion!).
<br />
<br />The silicon can be doped with elements that can donate a free electron or accept/bind an electron.  Donor dopants add free electrons to the material which can now drift through it (in the usual terminology: the majority carriers are electrons); this is called n-type silicon because the majority carriers are negative.  Acceptor dopants can be thought of as taking an electron from the surrounding material and thus adding an "absence" of an electron (called holes) which can drift through the material (in the usual terminology: the majority carriers are holes); this is called p-type silicon because the majority carriers are positive.
<br />
<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">A simple rectifying junction (diode)</span></strong>
<br />If a p-type material is placed next to an n-type material, current can flow fairly easily from p-type to n-type, but for all practical purposes, it can not flow in the other direction.  
<br />
<br />Remember: The direction of current is defined as the flow of net positive charge.  Thus holes can flow from p-type into n-type, and electrons can flow from n-type into p-type.  But the reverse processes can be considered non-existent here.  
<br />
<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Making a circuit on silicon</span></strong>
<br />A circuit is made by starting with a silicon wafer that is cut from a large single crystal.  The crystal is usually grown with some dopants purposely included.  For circuits, it is usually lightly p-type.
<br />
<br />The surface of the wafer is then patterned with different regions of p or n-type by adding more dopants (diffused or bombarded into the bulk from the surface).  I will refer to the actual silicon surface as the "diffusion layer".
<br />
<br />Then a pattern of heavily doped polysilicon lines are laid down.  These act as interconnects and also as the "gate" for transistors (they control whether the transistor "switches" on or off).  I will refer to this as the "polysilicon layer".
<br />
<br />The final layer is a metal layer.  These act solely as interconnects between the different parts of the circuit.  More advanced IC chips have more layers of metal (in analogy to multilayer printed circuit boards).
<br />
<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">An FET (Field Effect Transistor)</span></strong>
<br />First, here is what a cross section of a transistor looks like:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lateral_mosfet.svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lateral_mosfet.svg</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Notice that the gate is electrically insulated from the silicon surface of the transistor.  It is only the electric field from the gate that does the switching (hence the name "Field Effect" transistor).
<br />
<br />In that picture, there is n-type material, then p-type (under the gate), and then n-type.  If the gate is much more positive than the bulk under the gate, it will pull electrons to the surface.  When the surface has excess free electrons, it is effectively an n-type "channel" between the source and drain, so current can flow across.  For this reason this transistor is called an n-channel FET (nMOS).
<br />
<br />Similarly, we can build an FET with p-type material, then n-type material (under the gate), then p-type material.  Now, if the gate is much more negative than the bulk under the gate, it will pull "holes" to the surface.  When the surface has excess free holes, it is effectively a p-type "channel" between the source and drain, so current can flow across.  For this reason, this transistor is called a p-channel FET (pMOS).
<br />
<br />So, an nMOS should have the bulk at GND, and if the gate is at GND (+0V) the transistor is off, and if the gate is at Vcc (+5V), the transistor switches on.  In the opposite case, a pMOS should have the "bulk" at Vcc, and if the gate is at Vcc the transistor is off, and if the gate is at GND, the transistor switches on.

<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Making logic circuits with FETs</span></strong>
<br />Let us look first at the simplest logic gate: an inverter.

<br />
<br />To read these diagrams, the transistor with the bubble on the gate is pMOS.  No bubble on the gate is nMOS.
<br />
<br />So let's think it through.  Put an input signal of logic 0 (+0V/GND), the pMOS will turn on and the nMOS will turn off.  So our output will be connected to logic 1 (+5V/Vcc).
<br />
<br />If instead we put an input signal of logic 1 (+5V/Vcc), the pMOS will turn off and the nMOS will turn on.  So our output will be connected to logic 0 (+0V/GND).
<br />
<br />So if we put in logic 0 the output is logic 1, and if we put in logic 1 the output is logic 0.  This is an inverter.
<br />
<br />All logic is an expansion upon these ideas. Here is a nice article:

<br />
<br />Note in particular the NAND gate, and also look at the physical layer layout that they show as well.
<br />
<br />
<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Now for an example with real pictures</span></strong>
<br />
<br />If I follow the Clock line, the first thing it does is go to some circuitry to the right of ROM.
<br />Here are the raw pictures I grabbed this example from:

<br />
<br />I'll focus on the circuitry the clock signal goes through here.
<br />Here is the circuit with all layers intact:

<br />-------------------
<br />Here is the circuit with the metal (and cover oxide) removed:
<br /><img src="http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/tutorial/bottom.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />------
<br />Using those two pictures, here is a cartoon version of the bottom layers.
<br /><img src="http://www.neviksti.com/CIC/tutorial/bottom_commented.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />The light red (pink) is the p-type "bulk". The light blue is an n-type "tub like" region that pMOS transistors are put in.  For this reason, I often call it the n-well.  (Similarly, you could think of the p-type bulk as a p-well.)  The dark blue and dark red regions are the more heavily doped source and drain for transistors.  The green is polysilicon, and where it crosses the dark blue / dark red are the gate regions.  You will also notice dark red squares in pink regions, and dark blue squares in light blue regions.  This is done to allow better contact to the metal layer to attach the p-bulk to GND and the n-well to Vcc.  
<br />
<br />The black dots are where contacts have been made between layers (to the metal layer above in this case).  These were highlighted to help people notice what the connections between layers look like in the pictures.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Follow the circuit carefully and you will see that the clock signal is inverted once, then this signal is inverter again (and this final signal is output).  So this circuit block is a buffer.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps more people understand the pictures.
