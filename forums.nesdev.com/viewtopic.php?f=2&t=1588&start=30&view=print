<br />
<br />That's when I got reminded that I can't access <a href="http://nesdevwiki.ath.cx/" class="postlink">http://nesdevwiki.ath.cx/</a>.  I should also mention that I can't access Quietust's Nintendulator site (which shares the domain ath.cx).  It has been this way as long as I can remember, so it's probably a widespread issue (ie. ath.cx is inaccessible for many, if not all, users in China).  Perhaps someone can find a different host for it, or a temporary mirror.
<br />
<br />Edit: I've noticed now that <a href="http://nesdev.com/" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/</a> has a lot of nice links and actual documents online.  No faq or wiki there though.  Upon trying to find out what ath.cx is, it seems it's a dynamic dns service.. which may not be good anyway because it tends to be one of the least accessible kinds of things (in terms of workplaces, schools, etc.).

<br />I'm living in China, will graduate this year, and will be a professional online-game programmer soon. To develop emulators is my great interest, I have developed a NES (it's called FC in China) emulator and a GB/GBC emulator(both without sound <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> ).
<br />In my opinion, most of those programmers who speak English as their mother tongue are great.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" />  The best computer books are written in English.  Since I like programming, I read a lot of English books in college == studying English hard.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  By the way, love to see American movies.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> 
<br />
<br />This is my website about my emulator project :
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ershu.3q5.com">http://ershu.3q5.com</a><!-- m --> 
<br />It's a Chinese version.  Later I will put an English version. Recently, I'm stduying <em>The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing</em> in my spare time for adding sound support to my emulators.  Hope to make some friends here.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm really surprised how popular the NESdev China board is frequented, and how many chineese people are using it right after it was founded. I know that  a lot of reverse-engineering has been done in China and Taiwan, but I didn't know they still care about the NES/Famicom today. Looks like it had been a good idea to open the board.
<br />For some reason everything that have to do with reverse-engineering, emulation, piracy, is all about China and/or Taiwan. I'm unsure why, since I know nothing about those countries. I've heard that they are just full of people working incredibly hard since the age of 8 for an incredibly low salary, wich is kind of sad. Almost all electronics are made in the industry in those countries, just because it is cheaper. Again, I do fell like knowing nothing about China, so exange more knowlege on the net can only be good.

<br />1. Even today still have some manufacturers localizing NES games for commercial in China.
<br />
<br />2. Most of Chinese people's salary is much lower than Americian's. But our price is much lower too. Can you buy half a kilogramme of beef with less than 1$ in America ???  In China, you can. Low salary, low price. Your imagination about China was totally misunderstood. If you come to China, you will know how beautiful it is.
<br />
<br />3. Taiwan is not a country!! It's a part of China. OK ?!!

Strange things happen in language sometimes.  It's human nature.  If we try to force ourselves to use different words, it feels unnatural and we laugh.  Many of us have already been lectured about Taiwan several times by visiting Chinese students, even though we understand it very well in a nuanced way.  People who go into politics begin using their government's recommended terminology quickly, but other people just want to be natural and have friendly conversations.

<br />Maybe. But I'm not american, but european (I think it is similar to you, but not for us). I've no doubt China is an interesting country, but the economic situation isn't fair for both yours and ours :
<br />If anyone want to try its chance and create a new small entreprise here, it will have to put incredibly high prices because there is no other way, and it will run down and crash unless your entreprise is doing something very particular or of a very high quality, because products of big international companies that do all the building in chineese industry will be cheaper. So the only way to get a good job here is to go to high scool or university to work in reshearch and developpement, and work in big entreprises. But by doing so, you do nothing but enlarge the difference between the big entreprises and small ones, make technology progress, exploit more the chineese constructors and polluting more the planet. This is an horrible vicious circle, and should absolutely be stopped.
<br />
<br />You can also work in wood industry or something that have less changes over years, but for some reason I'm myself interested in computers and electronics, and unfortunately this kind of industry has big problems.

Are there not many RPGs for the FC in China? I can't imagine they have many. Maybe I'm just assuming too much, I don't really know anything about chinese. I'm learning japanese though, and I've learned a little about chinese through learning about japanese.

<br />When you have a mapper that's essentially an expanded TQROM, pattern table space isn't an issue. Take a typical NES game with 256 KiB PRG ROM and 128 KiB CHR ROM. Add an 8 KiB CHR RAM and double the PRG size. Then whenever a character speaks, the engine can copy kanji glyphs from PRG ROM into CHR RAM.

<br />
<br />PS : I really don't know how you guy could be so interesed about japanese and chinese languages. Learn an language that only use latin letters is really hard enough, I wouldn't assume to learn one wich has totally different and unreconisable letters.
