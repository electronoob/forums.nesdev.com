Is it fair to say that you want a unique identifier for each hardware configuration (mapper chip plus wiring plus whatever else?).  Other than memory size, which is represented already.<br /><br />Mapper numbers were supposed to be this unique identifier, but it sounds like there are a handful of mapper numbers that were used for multiple different configurations.<br /><br />Regardless of how we got in that situation, you don't want to re-map the conflicting ROMs to unique mapper numbers.  (a) that breaks backward compatibility, and (b) there will always be old ROMs floating around out there.<br /><br />So the idea is to add a sub-mapper number and use it to disambiguate those cases, which sounds pretty sensible to me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=330">mozz</a> — Mon Sep 18, 2006 6:47 am</p><hr />

I second this idea of storing mapper revision information. The problem is, how do we determine the revision? When I was testing other boards a while back, I found two MMC3B chips manufactured just weeks apart that behaved differently. I didn't check the boards thoroughly for an external explanation, but it is still a possibility.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sun Sep 17, 2006 1:42 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, even if no MMC1 card has ever had 32kb SRAM for example, it would be perfectly possible to build a card to handle that using the CHR selection line to select the SRAM banks. Bandits King of Ancient China does this with two 8kb SRAM chips, but one could have up to 32kb or even 64kb using the same trick. So if no submaper with that availability has been defined, the person who wants to devlop a MMC1 game that use a lot of SRAM will never be able to test his programm other than having a plugin for an existing emulator or to put all this together on a real cartridge.<br /></div><br />How would an emulator know how you wired up your 64KB RAM?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Sep 16, 2006 4:04 pm</p><hr />

It lists every single implemented mapper number, where it can be found, and what it is composed of.    Everything on it has been tested and revised, since it was produced when I made the FPGA NES.<br /></div><br /><br />Annnnnnnny chance of you releasing that any time soon? I don't mind if it is not finished, and I think that it will help us all discuss a new format.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=191">WedNESday</a> — Sat Sep 16, 2006 3:19 pm</p><hr />
