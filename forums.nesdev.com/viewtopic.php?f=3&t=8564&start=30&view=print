<br />ETA: Tried the any.deb, it says Wrong architecture 'any'. But if you make any "amd64" it should work, or at least let me attempt to install it. Although, I still think it does need a special compile too, but eh, worth a shot too maybe? But shouldn't your compiler have a 64-bit option even if 32-bit? Hmm...

<br />Yes I get that here also.  It isn't related to the welcome page -- at least here on my system it happens even when that page isn't set to show at start-up.  A related bug that I'm looking into has crept in because of recent changes to support multiple targets [NES and C=64 at present].  When a project is opened or closed there's a flurry of activity creating or destroying appropriate UI elements for the target being emulated in the project being opened or closed.  However, the delay you mention has been there on project closing even before this new change.

<br />I was able to reproduce the Project Properties problem easily here so have fixed it.  I'm still weeding through problems introduced in the IDE framework from the recent addition of support for C=64 target debugging [via remote monitor port connection to VICE emulator].  This was one of those.  I've committed to my local Git but won't be able to push to the repositories on gitorious until later this evening.  Meanwhile I'll go and look at the rest.
<br />
<br />Thanks very much for the reports and the help!

<br />About the slow-down, maybe you can use gcov to narrow down the problematic line.

<br />I'm using Arch Linux, so I can rather prepare PKGBUILDs (for cc65-svn c64-emulator-lib-git  nes-emulator-lib-git  nesicide-git  nesicide-emulator-git) and post them here (I can't promise they'll get into AUR though). Would it be okay?

<br />lol <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />Let me try to save the trouble for you.
<br />In case you are familiar with Gentoo ebuilds (I saw a it mentioned in the About Nesicide window), Arch Linux's PKGBUILD is something similar (but more primitive) to them. It's like a script that will fetch the sources from the upstream, compile and install, but just specific to Arch Linux.
<br />They are not the part of the official repos though, it's just another mechanism for people to install packages that doesn't exists in the official repos, and also serving as a tool for building from sources.
<br />
<br />In fact, there are already several (orphan) PKGBUILDs
<br />nesicide-git: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=48433">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=48433</a><!-- m -->
<br />nesicide-emulator-lib-git: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=48434">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=48434</a><!-- m -->
<br />which I belive used to work with Nesicide 1. They require minimal changes, but there's a catch; the repos don't seem to be independent. I could have the packages
<br />nesicide-c64-emulator-lib-git  nesicide-emulator-lib-git  nesicide-git  nesicide-emulator-git
<br />but it seems nes-emulator-lib requires nesicide sources. Which makes me consider: should I instead have single, monolithic package that will pull in everything. What do you think?
<br />
<br />(edit: nesicide-emulator-git or nes-emulator-git?)

What do you think?</div><br />Yes.  I am intending to merge all four repositories into one repository as soon as I can figure out how to do so in git without losing history.  If I can't figure it out I might just create a new "fresh start" master repo and put everything in it as if I'm starting from scratch, at which point the four existing repos will be obsoleted.  Then I'll push the big red "history eraser" button.<br /><br />So, having a single monolithic package is probably a good idea.  Maybe we should take this into PM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">torrasque wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">but there's a catch; the repos don't seem to be independent</div>
<br />
<br />This is true because of my hatred of repeating code fragments.  Unfortunately there's some code that's required on both sides of the fence [the IDE framework or the emulator libraries].
