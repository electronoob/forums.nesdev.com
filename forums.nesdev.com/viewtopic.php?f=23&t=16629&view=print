Do any games actually rearrange the levels to the levels to fit on a smaller screen?<br /><br />The only time I remember this being used is Kirby's Super Star using 24x24 tiles to recreate Kirby's Dreamland's 16x16 tiles on the Game Boy.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Early LCD Tetris games had a 6-cell-wide matrix (Nintendo TÉ›tris watch) or an 8-cell-wide matrix (Tetris Jr. keychain) instead of the standard 10. Tetris for Game Boy was cut down from 10x20 to 10x18 instead of using line interrupts and the scroll register to cut off the bottom scanline of each block. The <a href="http://crappy-games.wikia.com/wiki/Pro_200" class="postlink">Pro 200</a> had the full 10x20 matrix, but The Tetris Company had imports of games based on the Pro 200's MCU seized at the border.<br /><br />Dr. Mario for Game Boy was cut from an 8x16 matrix to 8x15, while Tetris Attack/Pokemon Puzzle Challenge was cut from 6x12 to 6x9. The matrix in Dr. Mario for GBA is even smaller, at 8x13, though the Puzzle League port on the same Game Pak has the standard 6x12 matrix.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Game Boy Bubble Bobble seems to be identical to the arcade game level-wise but it has added boss levels, cut-scenes and a different story as it's a one player only game. The game has all-directional scrolling to fit in the levels on the small screen. OK so this one actually has added content, I guess that wasn't what you where looking for.<br /><br />The Rockman World series are basically Game Boy ports of the NES series and mostly reuses the NES bosses, but it has totally redesigned levels and mixes bosses from usually two different NES games. Physics are also slowed down to work well on the small screen.<br />It's technically its own (apparently non-canon) series, but the earlier games was designed more like pared down ports.

It has the same story, and more or less the same level progression and bosses, mostly the same music.<br /><br />Aside from the levels there's a bunch of arbitrary changes, like no G'n'G style map between levels, characters renamed, etc. It's really bizarre to me... the only explanation I could think of is that they had a mandate to make the game longer, which meant making new levels anyway? (Personally I found the Ape Spit levels pretty boring by comparison.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I remembered hearing that the <em>Playstation 2</em> version of Ys III had nearly every scene shrunk/cut-into-sections so that there was almost no scrolling, for whatever reasons. That version was considered inferior in every single aspect compared to the 8/16-bit counterparts anyway.
