They can actually go in any direction, not just down.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FAaFIDF.png" alt="Image" /><br />I made a few levels for world 5, which takes on an art style similar to Double Action Blaster Guys. I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adffz6WS5Jc" class="postlink">a video</a> showing gameplay, and also showing one of the world 4 bosses.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vwzLaXx.png" alt="Image" /><br />You can fight Forehead Block Guy! He's the new World 2 boss. He walks at you while continuing to throw blocks.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oX3KuKE.png" alt="Image" /><br />The first world 4 boss is my old Fighter Maker 2 character, and he has three attack phases, where he first attempts to kick you, and then attempts to bodyslam you, and then does this trickier attack where he flies into the sky and stomps. You hurt him a few times to get him to move onto the next phase.<br /><br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I3fy9rO.png" alt="Image" /><br />The second World 4 boss is on the background layer, so I think the boss fight will end up involving platforms made of sprites. Not sure past that.<br /><br />I think I'm actually on track to finish this game this year, probably in June. I only have a few more levels and bosses to make, and I've gotta apply the rest of the polish I wanted to have as well as put the soundtrack in.

It's being done by za909 on this forum, though he no longer uses that name. He's already composed a bunch and there isn't a lot to go until the soundtrack's done and I put all of it in.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Very good! My only complaint is that I'm having difficulties reading pixelated monospace text with huge spacings. I'd rather prefer some SMB3-ish font which is more like Courier New, but that's a nitpick.<br /><br />About the gameplay, it's kinda fun, but very slippery. It's fast which is fun, but it's also tantalizing because if I run too fast, I can &quot;DIE!&quot; (as your sound effect says). Could you maybe add something like a glide option or a jetpack powerup which gives you the ability to extend your jump or to increase your Y speed upwards while in mid air?<br /><br />I like it how there's a level editor at the ending. I'm assuming that Nova figures out it's all a game and tries to do her best to save the day by hacking it and using some level editor tools to finally defeat the final boss. It's a very interesting concept to have a level editor as an unlockable thing near the ending of the game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tried to fix some of the slipperiness by making the speed and acceleration configurable, though maybe those options aren't enough? You can buy auto balloons from the shop (once you've unlocked it) to automatically rise up out of any pits you fall into. I'm not sure exactly which traits I should change to make it feel better. I don't think it's really recommended to run most of the time though, especially since you can't see super far ahead.<br /><br />The level editor is separate from the plot, and mostly because all of my previous NES releases, even the original Forehead Block Guy have one. &quot;You beat all the levels, go ahead and make some of your own&quot;, etc.
