<br />
<br />Lookup is simple:
<br />
<br />(y * width) + x
<br />
<br />If the width is a power of 2 value, you can shift the y value left and ORA the x value to accomplish the same task.

<br />This formula apply to write the column to the right of the screen, but basically, just by changing signs, you can do the same to write a column on the left, and a row on the top or on the bottom of the screen.
<br />
<br />To read the bytes, do it with the formula dish showed, and be carefull with 16-bit additions, indirect adressing, etc... If you do everything right, this would cause no problem (be sure to have a valid map reading routine before having a scrooling routine !!)
<br />
<br />Then just write those metatiles at correct PPU adress (that wouldn't be too much complicated, the adress increase by one when scrooling right, increase by 32 when scrooling down, etc... just beware of wrap-arround).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Celius, let me ask you a question: you know how to draw tiles to the NES screen, don't you? If you understand that there is no reason for you not to understand how a 2D map is represented in memory.
<br />
<br />The NES screen is just a 1D representation of a 2D space, just like the game maps. in the screen there are 32 columns. Tile number 0 is the first and number 31 is the last. then, in the next row, the first tile is number 32. The PPU memory is 1D, just like all memories in the world. Yet, you understand that and manages to use the screen just fine.
<br />
<br />Unless you don't really understand how the screen works, and manages to get your graphics on the screen by pure luck. Maybe you use a "screen arranger" and never actually got to calculate an address to write to an specifc point in the screen.
<br />
<br />Of course you can just go and use the formula we gave you a couple of times already, but this is a very important concept to master.
<br />
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">PLEASE</span>, follow this carefully:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">map/screen &#40;whatever&#41; array:<br /><br />&#40;row 00&#41; 000 001 002 003 004 005 006 ... 028 029 030 031<br />&#40;row 01&#41; 032 033 034 035 036 037 038 ... 060 061 062 063<br />&#40;row 02&#41; 064 065 066 067 068 069 070 ... 092 093 094 095<br />...<br />&#40;row 28&#41; 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 ... 924 925 926 927<br />&#40;row 29&#41; 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 ... 956 957 958 959</div>
<br />
<br />This is a representation of a 2D map that's 32x30 in size (the NES screen, for example). Each number is an address (offset, actually) for that particular location in the array. We see it arranged like this, in 2D, but in memory it's all just a long 1D run of values.
<br />
<br />The formula we gave you - (y * width) + x - is what you use to find the address of a particular location. In the example above, if we want the 3rd tile in the 3rd row, it would go like this:
<br />(y * width) + x = 2 * 32 + 2 = 66 -&gt; if you look in the grid above, number 066 is indeed the 3rd tile in the 3rd row.
<br />*keep in mind that the 3rd location has an index of 2, as 0 is the first*
<br />
<br />The rows are stored one after the other. So, if you want to to read (or write!) something from the 2nd row, you have to skip the first. That's what (y * width) does. "width" is the size of one row, so multiplying it by "y" will skip "y" rows. After that, we already know the address of the row of our interest, now we need to find the specifc element in this row that interests us. We just add "x" now, since each row is linear.
<br />
<br />I hope you understand it a little better now.

That's very unreliable. I don't know about this bg code though. You don't want to see my version of this code running in Nintendulator. It looks like a frickin hurricane. And virtuaNES puts all the tiles in the wrong place. NESticle and Jnes do the Junkdemo right, and Jnes does my code, but not NESticle. I was wondering how the heck you could get a C program to output that hibber jibber you see when you open a .nam file in Notepad? If I knew how to output reliable code for the NES to output on the screen, I would just stop this whole thing and make my own level editor, which I would like to do, but I'm afraid i wouldn't know how to put it in my code. That didn't make much sense. Well, i'm going to go. bye.</div>
<br />
<br />Well, i tried to Compile\Assemble it on X816, And it will not compile,
<br />I am making my own clone of SMB out of this code, With Turn
<br />Blocks from SMW and P-switches and stuff! but i still could NOT
<br />assemble it! is there something wrong with the Assembler or the
<br />ASM file itself, or If you have a working MOS\NES assembler that
<br />handles the source code. then email me at: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:JAJJMM@MSN.COM">JAJJMM@MSN.COM</a><!-- e -->
<br />
<br />Thank you for the source code!
