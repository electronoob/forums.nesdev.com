		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay I'm doing some experimentation with the starfox 1.0 american rom.  I want to add this line of hex code to the rom:<br /><br />&quot;A9 A0 8D 37 30&quot;<br /><br />This should tell the gsu series superfx chips to enable a mode that'll make it run smoother.  Obviously you need a gsu 1 / 2 instead of the mario chip to make use of it.  Anyway I need help getting the game rom to run this line of code once (during initialization) so it sets the gsu chip to high speed multiplier mode.  Any help is greatly appreciated.

Find some ROM space in the same bank you can overwrite (e.g. lots of FF bytes in a row). Put your code there, as well as the instruction that writes to $2100. Replace original $2100 write with JSR to your code. End your code with RTS.<br /><br />BTW, nifty idea.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, I already know this will work.  After poking around the starfox 2 rom I discovered that starfox 2 doesn't have high speed multiplier mode enabled for some reason.  Since I needed to disable double clock speed mode in the game to allow it to overclock faster, I just re-wrote that register write to enable high speed multiplier mode.  Now starfox 2 has way less slowdown.  Also in the same register write by accident I set the &quot;IRQ Interrupt Mask&quot; to &quot;disabled irq&quot; which allowed the game to overclock all the way up to the top speed of the superfx chip (53/54 mhz range).  Before doing this when I overclocked past 48 mhz the screen would flicker constantly.  For fun I edited the doom rom to have high speed multiplier mode disabled, burned the rom, man does doom run like a slug with that mode disabled, having high speed multiplier mode enabled really helps with slowdown.<br /><br />Also when you say &quot;writes to 2100&quot; would it look something like &quot;A9 xx 8D 00 21&quot; ?

But my experiment worked, setting high speed multiplier mode and disabling the &quot;IRQ Interrupt Mask&quot; make the game able to run at astronomical speeds.  I cleared the entire game at 60 mhz, it's too fast at 60 mhz it becomes unplayable so I'm going to try 57 mhz.

I did just that I figured out how to get the breakpoints working found where it writes only once to 2100 and just replaced it with my register write and now starfox 1 runs at 57 mhz.<br /><br />What's interesting is in the config register (3037) if I set the &quot;IRQ Interrupt Mask&quot; to disable irq both starfox 1 and starfox 2 are capable of overclocking much faster.  I wonder why this is.  Stunt race fx it seems to make no difference, same with doom.  Also good to know that starfox 2 does set the mode, I guess the speed boost is just from me disabling irq in the config.
