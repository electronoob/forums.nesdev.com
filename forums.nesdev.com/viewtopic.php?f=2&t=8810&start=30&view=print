		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In Chapter 8, are you planning on covering background collision detection, as well?  Or just sprite to sprite collision?  I'm guessing the latter.  It would probably be best to cover just basic collision in Chapter 8 assuming a non-scrolling game and then come back and re-cover it in Chapter 0D when you talk about scrolling.  (BTW, I LOVE that you're using hex values for the chapter numbers!)
<br />
<br />Scrolling does add some more complication to sprite and background collision.  And the things you'll probably cover in Chapter 9 will be useful in scrolling collision.  (e.g. using 16 bit numbers, high byte for screen number, low byte for xScroll, carry flag to inc or dec which screen the camera/objects are on once xScroll or their x coords wrap from 255 to 0 or vice versa.)
<br />
<br />Also, are you planning on covering background compression and de-compression in your Scrolling chapter?  That may be confusing to beginners, but it's essential to building a scrolling game -- unless it's a two-screen sports game or the shortest scrolling platformer you've ever played.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" />  There are also infinite methods to handle background compression, so we'd probably better discuss which would be the easiest to understand for a newb who's read up through Chapter 0D, even if it's not the most efficient.  We can always explain that the reader is free to explore more efficient yet harder to understand compression methods once they are done with the book.

<br />Seriously, though, tepples' example projects [and a few others like Shiru's full-blown Alter Ego written in C] make for wonderful tutorial projects.  I'm hoping to include parts of them as template projects for starting users.  Specifically, the parts such as linker configuration that everyone [myself included, sometimes] whines about as being the roadblock-to-entry for using the CC65 toolchain.

However, cutting costs will be taught as a core principle of good coding rather than an advanced programmer's trick. I've heard far too many gray-haired hackers complain that the younger generation has no conception of the cost an instruction. They're correct. Counting cycles is an essential skill that reflects a practical knowledge of the targeted hardware.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Would such work environment perhaps include an IDE?</div><br /><br />At first, the only tools will be a text editor, an assembler, and a brain. I don't want the reader to use a time saving tool at the expense of a clear understanding of the concept being learned. I think that this is particularly the case will tile editors. However, once core concepts have been covered then other tools will certainly be introduced to save time and ease development. And, if the time is right, then a certain IDE might be a likely candidate for inclusion <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />. All tools will need to be stable, accurate, and platform agnostic. In the appendix on tools I will include platform specific tools so that no worthy contenders get neglected, but I won't be able to recommend a tool in the main body of the text that not everyone can use (of course, this poses no problem for nesicide!).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">bigjt_2 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In Chapter 8, are you planning on covering background collision detection, as well?

Background collision will be reserved for the actual game, and a more dynamic background. Like tepples' NROM template, chapter 08 will probably just use a horizontal plane and two boundary blocks for collision detection.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, are you planning on covering background compression and de-compression in your Scrolling chapter?</div><br /><br />Yes, compression is too ubiquitous, and too useful, to be ignored.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">cpow wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Specifically, the parts such as linker configuration that everyone [myself included, sometimes] whines about as being the roadblock-to-entry for using the CC65 toolchain.</div><br /><br />CC65 linker configuration will be covered at length in some chapter; this is a very handy tool!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">B00daW wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Not sure if you will find use in adding little bubble hints or tips; but it might be useful to cater to more advanced coders who may want to include some DPCM samples and reference the DPCM and controller glitch or other glitches that the hardware has.</div>
<br />
<br />As far as advanced tips go, I will probably mimic the style of old Osborne microcomputer guides, i.e. heavily-weighted text for essential topics and regular weight for deeper discussion of those topics. I will cover every every hardware "glitch" that I'm aware of (or that any kind person makes me aware of!) in the NES hardware appendix, and probably the main text as well.

<br />Agreed. After introducing the basic concepts (sprites, maps, collision, physics, etc.) you could have sections for specific game types, detailing how those concepts would be applied in each case.

<br />
<br />Sorry, was being facetious.  Sometimes joking around doesn't translate well via text.
<br />
<br />I was being serious about starting with a higher level language to ease the beginner in.  I've seen enough ASM programming tutorials for ASM programmers written by ASM programmers.  While people may have some familiarity with ASM when the NES came out C and other higher level languages are now the norm.
<br />
<br />It sounds like he's too far along to change gears.  Regardless, the more tutorials on NES development the better I say.

<br />Too far along?  There's nothing but the README on github.
<br />
<br />I too was being facetious and poking fun at the broken promise [daily updates].  I am very much looking forward to reading/helping--hell, I'd even volunteer to take over the project if it has truly been abandoned [though, taking over isn't the right term since I'd be inheriting a set of principles, not a partially completed product].  So part of my facetiousness was jumping in only five days after the promise was made to point out that it had already been broken.  I know perfectly well from my own experience that we all have busy lives...so it was meant as a joke/prod.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
