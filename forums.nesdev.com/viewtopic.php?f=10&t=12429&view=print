		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Are there actually two of these? This is my confusion.<br /><br />I thought these samples were only allowed within $C000-$FFFF. But, when searching for the cheering dpcm during the intro to Mike Tysons Punch Out, its located within a bank that is used with $A000-$BFFF. I was able to have that sample, within the Capcom 6c80 sound engine I'm using for a new project.<br /><br />So do I have the right info? Are there dpcm and pcm?<br /><br />Thanks for reading!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is only one audio channel on the NES for &quot;digital output&quot; (i.e. raw digital samples).  It's been called many different things over the years: DPCM, PCM, DMC.  There is no consistency, sorry to say.  Technically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation" class="postlink">PCM</a> is technically the &quot;sample format&quot; of the data, although to be more precise it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_modulation" class="postlink">DPCM</a> (delta pulse code modulation).<br /><br />I certainly expect a sperglord to show up and pee all over the above information.  *braces self*<br /><br />The <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU#DMC_.28.244010-4013.29" class="postlink">APU DMC</a> can only read sample data from $C000-FFFF.  It cannot read data from any other location.  So I do not see how it would be possible for the game to be playing digital audio from content that is located in $A000-BFFF; the APU DMC cannot do this.<br /><br />Punch Out! uses <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC2" class="postlink">MMC2</a>, where the last 3 PRG banks are hard-wired to $A000-FFFF; only $8000-9FFF is &quot;changeable&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Banks can be loaded into multiple slots, so something that's visible at $A000-$BFFF can also be loaded at $C000-$FFFF.<br /><br />As for the DPCM vs. PCM thing, I always thought that DPCM was what we called the 1-bit per sample audio format that the NES is able to play automatically, while PCM were the 7-bit samples you can manually write to the APU.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, technically the DMC <em>can</em> read samples outside of $C000-$FFFF, but only when exploiting address overflows. It cannot start a sample outside $C000-$FFFF, but if the DMC reads a sample and it's going past $FFFF, <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_DMC#Memory_reader" class="postlink">then the address will oddly wrap at $8000</a>. This can be done e.g. by starting a sample at $FFC0 and configuring a sample to be more than $40 samples i.e. writing $FF to $4012 and writing &gt;$03 to $4013.<br /><br />...but that's a corner case, and that's not that useful to know here <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />. I don't know that game but the sample must be located at run time somewhere in $C000-$FFFF, maybe you're wrongly interpreting the address where you've found the sample? Punch-Out!! has 128KB PRG-ROM, the sample must be located in the last 16K of it, so in the .nes file, the offset in byte should be between 0x0001C010 and 0x00020010.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Punch Out uses raw PCM (timed writes to $4011) to output the cheering sound, that's why it can be located anywhere in the CPU memory space. This works out because there's nothing else going on while the sound plays.

If it's not 1-bit delta values, it's not DPCM, but some other format the game program will decode itself and manually write to the APU.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for all that information guys!<br /><br />Just a quick response regarding the cheering sample. I have this 'dpcm' working within my mmc5 rom, and having it being read within my $A000-$BFFF bank, I have the cheer coexisting with my sound engine AND an irq split screen at the same time. So I guess the comment earlier, about writes to $4010 is the trick to load samples in other address ranges rather than $C000-$FFFF.<br /><br />Again thanks for the clarifications on dpcm, so now I know its only 1 of 'em.<br /><br />Btw, to those curious on the mmc5 pcm, the cheering sample worked on the mmc5's pcm, when I changed the $4010 to $5010, (I think that's the mmc5 register, thinking off the top of my head atm)
