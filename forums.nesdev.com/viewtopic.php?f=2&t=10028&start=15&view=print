Like said, you have to write program in C or assembly, and run it through the right programs (CC65/ASM6) for it to look at the program and process it to a .NES ROM with the program you wrote in the file. Even if this happens, you have to write the code 100% right to get any results even with the right compiler/assembler. You should read on different assemblers/compilers to understand how they work, as it seems you don't even understand what tool you need, let alone how to use it! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />AFAIK, ConTEXT is a context sensitive text editor, that helps you with writing your codes. Having just an editor won't make you eligible in writing stuff for a specific system immediately and you still need to learn how to code for it (which I suppose those youtube videos are for). Getting the (C-) source codes to that particular text editor wouldn't help either, unless you need to compile the <em>editor</em> yourself, or do you want to compile ConTEXT into a NES rom? But why?<br /><br />If you just want to make games just follow those tutorials people suggested. People normally enter codes with text editors and any text editors will do, then parse the source text files with compilers or assemblers to get executables or roms. ConTEXT is just one of these text editors, and it has syntax highlighting that helps you with coding. That's it.<br /><br /><strong>edit:</strong> Ninja'd by 3gengames.

The popular ones are ASM6, NESASM3, and CA65. They all work in different ways, they all will have information on the features they have in documentation on the site. That's basically ALL there is to it, it's YOUR job to figure everything else out, basically. Most of those will be command line tools, which we showed ya how, but if not then go to Nintendoage and download a nerdy nights file and look at the .bat to see how command line tools are run from a batch file.<br /><br />And google for YY-Chr 0.98 Beta 2. I believe it's the last one until they went to a MS-generic library and made it into complete trash excuse for a graphics editor.

The language is &quot;assembly language&quot;; the program that turns it into object code is an &quot;assembler&quot;. The popular assemblers here are &quot;asm6&quot; and &quot;ca65&quot;. A lot of people find asm6 easier to set up for the first time, but ca65 might be better for large projects once your skills pass a certain point.<br /><br />Apart from YY-CHR, the other way to draw graphics is to make a BMP or PNG file in GIMP and then use a program to convert that to the CHR format that the NES expects.
