<br />
<br />So you tried another PCB with a <em>different</em> game? How do you know that it wasn't the other game that was the cause? This is what I meant about sloppy testing. By varying the PCB <em>and</em> the game tried, you made it more difficult to determine the cause, so we're left guessing, is it the game, or is it the PCB, or soldering job? This is the kind of thing that makes me less-enthusiastic about offering help, BTW, seeing that it's just hacking around without a lot of careful attention.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, wait a minute <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />I tried a different game, it's true. Because desoldering the other (zelda outlands) i accidentaly broke a pin on a chip.
<br />I will try again to determinate if it was caused by the rom when i get another pcb availabe <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />I can't remeber if i did that but do you think that if i tried without a diode the battery could have damaged something? like, i don't know, the mmc1 chip? or the sram?
<br />I have to say it was probably a bad soldering problem because with the multimeter i spotted some point that now (in the working one, faria) doesn't have any voltage passing through them; in the zelda one there was current passing there... I don't know if this is clear <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />Anyway now that i made a working one i know where to solder the battery!
<br />If anybody need that:
<br /><strong>Positive (+) goes, watching the rear of the pcb having the battery spot in the up/right corner, on the soldering square on the left. The negative (-) goes on the MIDDLE one.</strong>

<br />
<br />
<br />So the one on the left was positive. Booyah. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I want one of these boards now. XD

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />sorry for the delay... i was really busy:) anyway the problem was not the rom. It was just the battery, since i din't know how to do it, i soldered it in the wrong way. Tested with the "battery knowledge thing" it all went good:) thanks to everyone:)
