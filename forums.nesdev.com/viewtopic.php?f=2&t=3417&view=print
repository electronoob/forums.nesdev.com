		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As you know, this is really NES related stuff, Can you convert **GB Roms
<br />(Z80) to NES roms? (6502). I know, There is a Codemasters version, But I want a way to convert it by a Windows/Dos executable!
<br />
<br />Is it possible? If so, please create the program (I do not care how much time it takes to program the binary!)
<br />
<br />This is because of 3 advantages: Colorizing **Gameboy games, porting games and it should be useful
<br />
<br />** Only for the Original (and possibly Super) GameBoy Games, No GBC
<br />(Unless you add external support, Which requires some to ASM hack or something like that.)
<br />
<br />Good luck on creating the program 
<br />
<br />This thread is only for people who know (At least Advanced) Z80 AND 6502 ASM, especially Chris Covell, He should know everything of these assembly languages.

Even targeting one specific game would be really hard (and might as well port it the old-fashioned way at that point).
<br />
<br />I'm sure I could do it if you wouldn't mind it running in super-slow-motion, but I wouldn't want to do it just for the fun of it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Someone did the opposite once (turning NES ROMs into GBC ROMs), but they ran slow as hell. And I imagine it's harder for a 6502 to emulate a Z80 than the opposite, so I think that GB games converted to the NES would run even slower.
<br />
<br />I also think that there are so many different things between the 2 systems (like video and sound hardware, memory mapping, ammount of memory and so on) that would make a direct conversion pretty much impossible...
<br />
<br />If the conversion handled only B&amp;W games, the differences in video hardware could be ignored if this "emulator" was pixel-based (and rendered individual pixels to CHR-RAM), but that would only make it all even slower! And that would kill the option of coloring games.

I coded a converter-program that disassembled a ROM and converted opcode by opcode to a 68000 version. However I gave up since I noticed that the converted code wouldn't be as fast as I hoped it should.
<br />
<br />A screenshot of the tool I created can be viewed here (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://safir.amigaos.se/bildgalleri/users/2375.png">http://safir.amigaos.se/bildgalleri/users/2375.png</a><!-- m -->) if anyone's interested.

<br />
<br />Making hacks for HKW was pretty tough, because for almost every variable in the game, the code does this:
<br />
<br />load A with the variable from whatever RAM location
<br />save it to $20-$2x in ZP
<br />modify it in ZP
<br />load it into A then save it back to whatever RAM location.
<br />
<br />That always struck me as very Z-80-like.

But the CPU and PPU (having what basically is a second BG layer for example) are quite different, and iirc the gameboy also has a timer and a scanline counter etc. Perhaps it would be an interesting project to try to do this, but I doubt you'd get any decent results out of it.

<br />If you want to see what happens when you try to run a GBC game on a GB, run Drymouth in GB mode.  It lacks the check.  You will notice that the tilemap is quickly replaced by the attribute table, making the game unplayable.

<br />I don't think the Super Gameboy can display as many colors as the GBC either. I'm not sure, but I think the coloring scheme is very different between those two.
