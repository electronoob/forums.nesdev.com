		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While browsing d4s filedump's picture, I stumbled on what seem to be a new SNES flash cart that can load from SD like the Powerpak or the Everdrive and is much cheaper.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://ramfactory.com/products.php?64SZ-UF&amp;osCsid=029mimuahi17timt03eh0afqq4" class="postlink">http://ramfactory.com/products.php?64SZ-UF&amp;osCsid=029mimuahi17timt03eh0afqq4</a>
<br />
<br />This cart seem to support Capcom's CX4 chip and is pretty cheap (65.10$ for 64 MBit / 71.30$ for 128 MBit) and support game up to 48 MBit, not sure why the 128MBit version is for though. I checked the manual and it's pretty intense and full of technical info that I supposed will be of some use for people that can understand it. I almost impulsively bought one but then realize that the menu showing on the youtube video is in russian and not sure if there's a way to switch to english yet even tough I'm pretty sure there 's a way.
<br />
<br />Anyone heard of it before? I was pretty surprised to see that it support CX4. Wonder if they would be able to add more special chip support with an upgrade. Who are those guy anyway?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Right, the Cx4 is emulated. Given how well it's understood now it's not surprising. And it's not as complex or demanding as say the Super FX or SA-1. I hope the sd2snes is able to support Super FX. That would make for a very impressive flash cart. I'm sure Star Fox 2 would have nothing to do with the large demand for sd2snes then.

<br />
<br />I know the uncompressed Star Ocean is 96Mbit, but they say the maximum rom size supported is 48Mbit on the website so I was wondering what was the 128Mbits for...
<br />
<br />And I agree it does look an awful lot like sd2snes, specially that sd2snes also have CX4 support.
