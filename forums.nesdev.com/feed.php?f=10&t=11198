If you have no need for video out (although I don't know why you wouldn't need it), you can in fact use the PPU address bus to control peripheral devices, without adding much extra logic to control them.<br /><br />You can use the audio out to generate square waves of varying duty and frequency, although it is important to know that these are analog signals so you should connect to something that is using such a signal (normally, it is the speaker in a TV set).<br /><br />What is it that you are trying to make anyways?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4734">zzo38</a> — Fri May 09, 2014 11:31 pm</p><hr />

The exact timing is detailed <a href="http://nesdev.com/6502_cpu.txt" class="postlink">here</a>, amongst other places. Also Visual6502 and Visual2A03 are good references.<br />To TL;DR that:<br />6502 has a clock called φ2. The address bus from the 6502 is stable while φ2 is high, as are writes on the data bus. Data for reads must have arrived by the falling edge of φ2. Any given instruction consists of one to three bytes, which are the first bytes read from memory for any given instruction. Additional bus activity might happen afterwards.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />3.

Instead, the hardware designer chooses a specific set of addresses to map to certain functions. For example, the NES's RAM is mapped from $0000-$1FFF, and the PPU is available from $2000-$3FFF. The NES's sound registers are mapped from only $4000-$4015. An extra IC such as a 74'138 would allow you to decode a smaller subset of the 64KiB address range the 2A03 can address. If you combine that with a latch, such as a 74'74, you can make a region of memory (say $6000-$67FF) which will store the number your program wrote.<br /><br />Additionally, there is no constraint that your registers not overlap your program data. Many NES games took advantage of this. The 74'161 was used in a large number of NES games to extend the total amount of memory (either program or graphic) that the game could address.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Mon Apr 28, 2014 2:27 pm</p><hr />
