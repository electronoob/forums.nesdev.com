I open the NED, and see that there's another track at the end. I delete, save, and press enter, and make the NSF. I listen again, and it's still there! I open the NED, It's still there! It's another bug! WHY!? IT'S SO STUPID! AND I CAN'T FIX IT! WHY!??? I've come to a conclusion. NT2 is a very low class program! But very useful... Any idea what's wrong and how to fix it?

<br />YES! I didn't think I would ever hear anyone say that! I have hear an NSF with 7 songs on it, and 1 sound effect for the Cure 2 spell. And I also have made some graphics if you'd like to see:

Sorry, due to stupid difficulties, you must copy and paste the url into a new tab or something... And please, tell me what you think! I know it needs some touching up, like the FFVII world map theme, at the end, it gliches, and there's a horrid fuzz out sound on one of the notes.

<br />I suspected that scince months (with your problems loading a FFVII title screen). I think that you had a good idea, so you decided to learn programming, right ? If so that's not bad at all, but you probably shouldn't hoping do it alone. I think it would be better to get some allies to get things faster and better. It's up to you to determinate anyway.
<br />Definitely, NT2 should NOT be used in a such project. If you were juse making FFVII music to entertain, it would be okay, but if you plan to actually programm a NES version of FFVII you would have a lot of trouble incorporing NT2 engine in it and to make it working with sound effects, etc... It would just be a shame. I think you or someone else should write a better engine to handle high-quality sound and SFX, so the game won't be disgraded.
<br />Your links you posed are unusable, I didn't get the ' thing. Please post a valid filename, I would be interessed to see how it looks.
<br />I hope for you that your project won't be shutted down by Square-Enix, Sony nor Ninendo and that you won't go in prison for violating intellectual propritety.
<br />Finally, you should put more effort to make light-and-shadow effects on Cloud's face. That would look better. On the NES you can use a combination of BG and sprites to reach such graphics, this is perfectly doable in the menu, I guess.

It wouldn't let me do a whole url of that, so I just said to copy and paste it into another tab on firefox, or whatever browser you have. Okay, about the portraits. Since the NES can only use 4 sprite palletes, it's hard to do portraits. I am proud of the result of them. I plan to use the same method FF2 did to load the portraits. Load them as sprites intead of BG tiles. And since you can only have 3 characters at a time in your party, you'd be able to pull off using 3 palletes for the portraits, and 1 pallete for the hand, and icons, and such. And when you have to have all portraits on the screen while changing party members, you'd just use the hand pallete for characters that aren't in your party, so their portraits would be in grayscale. It's kind of confusing if you don't look at the chr file, so you can see what I mean if you look at it. I've been really selfish about this project in the past, but I was going to ask you, would you like to work on this with me? You're pretty much the only hardcore FF fan that knows NESdev, that I know of. So I'd really like for you to work on this with me. Do you accept?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Of course.
<br />I successed loading the files and watched the graphics, that looks pretty good, especially the faces, but that could be better, if you see what I mean. It is very important than luminosity does 90% of graphics and color does 10%
<br />However, portraits needs a bunch of colorness to be cool. I think you should make some sprites overlaps some others to have more color, or simply comine background and sprites. For example, Megaman is made of five colors, black, dark blue, light blue, yellow and white. How's that possible, the nes only have 3 ? There is the "armor" sprite, that's black, blue and light bluw, and the "face" sprite, that is black, yellow and white.
<br />I'd really like to work on the music. Because I LOVED write the only (simple) NES sound engine I wrote, and I'm pretty much inspired to write a more advanced one. I happened to convert more than a half of FF7 music to MIDI format, just by listening the CD, step by step, and rewrite all notes. That was my best plasure, before I was dealing with programming, heh. I think I really should write a sound engine and input all data in it for music. I did already a half of the work with MIDIs, and actually I havent trough that I was doing that for any use before. If my work could be used, that would be cool.
<br />Just tell me what mapper and what size you have in mind for the total project. If I do that, I would need bankswitching, so I would need how bankswitched the game is. You're most probably gonna to use save games, so I think MMC1 would be just fine. (SNROM, SKROM (in function of if you want CHROM or CHRAM, this doesn't affect music in any way anyway (hehe, english can be fun sometimes) ), or SOROM to have more SRAM or SUROM to have more PRG). Or do you plan to use MMC5 with ultra-powerfull graphics ? In that case I can dispose of more advanced bankswitching, and even have RAM in PRG space. I think MMC1 would be enough to make a powerfull sound engine, it's up to you the main programmer to determine.
<br />I'm ready to help you in anyother domain, but you'll probably need more people to do a such project. I've suspended my RPG simply because I haven't enough programming skills, and because I needed friends and other people to work with me. But, to say it so, I had to already have done something, else nobody would belive it when I say "hey, do you want to join me to make a NES RPG ?". So I began my simpler action/adventure game I'm working right now.

Yeah, and I'd like to use CHR-RAM, but I've never really used it, so I should probably get familiar with using CHR-RAM. And I was thinking about making a good IDE that would have a map editor, and a text editor, and stuff. Though what it would to is it would have multiple tabs on it, like this:
<br />
<br />_________________________
<br />|Map Editor| Text Editor| Battle Editor|
<br />
<br />and instead of making binary hibber jibberish, it would encode data into an asm file as you kept editing, and then you could assemble it to make your game! Do you think the IDE sounds good? And I'd like to hear a sample of your FFVII NES music. Perhaps you could make a ROM that plays a song from FFVII for me, and please make it not the prelude, if you do. With this IDE, I think it would be SO much faster, and alot less confusing. What do you think?

<br />I also need to know wich assembler I should use. I'm now pretty much familiar with WLA-DX, but I think the whole project should be done with the same assembler. NESHLA maybe ?
<br />Else, you could still incbin my file in your, and I will make a pratical vectors, so you just have to call $8000 to init and $8003 to play, and it's up to me with my separate assembler to do it.
<br />Okay, I'll make a MMC1-bankswitched sound engine. I'll include fair pitch control (vibrato, detune, slide, portamento) and fair volume control (ADSR or something, with possible fade in and out, and master volume control for each track). Overall, a sample should be ready in several weeks. I will decide wich tunes I'll do this night (sleeping is good to take ideas). I think the rufus welcoming ceremony is cool and pretty easy to do.
<br />I'll try to make my engine pretty efficiant in RAM and ROM, etc... Of course, I'll make sound effect playback possible, and easy to use for the main programmer. I think it's better to work on more than one people on a project. I really want to deal with the sound <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />

I'm not exactly sure how I'll go about doing the opening sequence. It will be hard in 2 dimensions. I think I have an idea though. I don't know which assembler we should use. Neshla may be good, but I HATE setting things up. I've never really used Wla-DX too much. It was really confusing. To be honest, my current assembler is Nesasm. I was <span style="text-decoration: underline">NOT</span> planning on using it for FFVII, though. I'm not sure how to convert Nesasm to Wladx code. But I think we should use Wla-dx. But what do you think of my idea for the IDE? I think it could be good, but may be hard to make. I suck at C/C++, though, but I'm getting better. But yeah, before I make the IDE, I'll have to write the engine, and you can write the sound engine.

<br />Having separate code for field, battle and menu would be a fair stating point. In your VBlank, you may check a flag to know if you are in battle, on field or in menu, and then jump to a different adress in function of that. Or maybe doing a RAM vector and use jmp (indirect) in your NMI, or use jump tables. Scince you have to update field tiles, and text box tiles on field, you'll probably need more advanced text box buffers in menu, and in battle, you'll have to upload stuff like monster and status bar.
<br />About the oppening sequence, I think you'll need to make it much simpler than on the original game. Making a horizontal scrooling train with a town background (I mean changin the horizontal scroll value midframe), then make it stopping and make Cloud and Barret jump out of it would be the NES equivalent of what you see on the Play Station.
<br />The bombing mission is my favorite, so I'll do it along with several simpler tunes.... However, scince the NES has 3 channels + noise for drums, it needs to be remixed a lot.

Megaman games can show the palettes of 8 different "mens" with the same palettes, why wouldn't the same be applicable for FF7 party members ?

I think I'll be using about 1, and that will leave me with three blank palletes for the bg. I am using materia as sprites, you can see in the chr file I gave you. thankfully you'll only see 1 pallete on screen for the portrait when materia is visible. In the materia changing screen the sprite palletes will be like this:
<br />$??,$??,$??   
<br />$29,$05,$28  
<br />$03,$22,$FF   
<br />$00,$10,$20
<br />
<br />the question marks are whatever colors the character's portrait are colored with, and the middle ones are materia, and the last one is the pallete for the hand/icons. I know the BG pallete I'm going to use:
<br />$3F,$01,$10,$30
<br />
<br />so yeah, I could make it so there are 8 colors per portrait! if I have three left. What would I use the other palletes for? Okay. My IDE, I think I didn't explain well. It would have a map,battle,text etc. editor, but it wouldn't make a binary file to incbin in your code. It would make a binary file to get the current state of how all the maps look and stuff, but it wouldn't really have anything to do with the game itself. There would be a tap that says "asm file", and it would be the tab you click on to look at your asm file, of course. but what the IDE would do, is as you go along, it encodes data into your asm file. Like say there was a pallete editor, and you clicked on the tab that likewise, said pallete editor. there would be a screen with all the colors on it , and you click on which ones you want. Say I clicked on $3F,$30,$26, and $24. I would go back to my asm file tab, and there would be a segment that says:
<br />
<br />pallete:
<br />         .db $3F,$30,$26,$24
<br />
<br />Sound good? do you understand? it writes asm code for you, as you keep editing. and it would make a binary file that keeps your map/text etc. info, so when you open the IDE, your still at your current place, if you know what I mean. I'm sorry, I need to learn how to talk. Well, I hope you understand that, because I think that's what I'm going to use. I would of course write the engine to the game first, and then the data that's encoded into the asm file would be engine friendly, and work well with the engine. Tell me what you think.
