		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're right. That's a picture from a MiWi console I've got from a canadian web page (dunno which was, but I remember that it had a pink rabbit as his icon)
<br />
<br />I were interested in the pinout, because I have two portable NOACs with LCD and the same glob-top'd ROM chip, so I wanted to replace them with better games. Thus, all I had to do was to find the pinout of a Onebus cart
<br />
<br />Then, with that pinout, buy that MiWi, open the game cart, and trace the pins from the cart edge to the small ROM board, to discover its pinout

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have uploaded some pics of my Power Joy Supermax cartridges <a href="http://imgur.com/a/QxmzO" class="postlink">here</a>. The PCBs of my carts and your one seem almost identical (same XD AB2187R1.2 text), but they are not.
<br />
<br />On your cartridge, follow the trace from pin 46 of the cart connector. (On a normal Famicom cart with no sound hardware, pin 46 is connected to pin 45.) It looks like the trace ends at a pair of solder pads which, if they were bridged, would tie the audio in line to Vcc. (It's not clear from the pic whether or not the solder pads -- if that's what they are -- are bridged or not. Also note the solder blob on your board which connects a via to the adjacent Vcc line.)
<br />
<br />With my cart board, pin 46 is not obviously tied to Vcc, but the trace goes to two vias in the PCB, so I'd need to use a multimeter to find exactly where it connects to.
<br />
<br />So it looks like some one-bus Famicom clones must change their behaviour somehow when the audio in line is tied to Vcc.

<br />It's exactly as yours, just this detail is different.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah okay. So wherever that via leads to, it's tied to Vcc by the solder blob (instead of being connected to the console audio in line). The audio in line still leads <em>somewhere</em> though. Hmm...
<br />
<br />Another thing about the Supermax cart board... cart pin 57 (normally CHR D7 but ROM D15 for one-bus systems) isn't connected to anything. Strange. And also, notice there is a pair of solder pads which would allow pins 48 &amp; 49 to be connected (as they are in most Famicom carts).
<br />
<br />Edit: Looking at the MiWi cart board pics I posted, there are two pairs of solder pads labelled A0 and VD7. The VD7 pads are connected on the PCB. But if the other pair were connected instead, A0 instead of VD7 would be routed to wherever the PCB trace leads. The Supermax cart boards might be hard-wired to have A0 connecting to the equivalent place, since their VD7 pin is not connected to anything.
