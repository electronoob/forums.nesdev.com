<br />I think that is the best description of the picture in the link.  From my understanding, the GBA cart is only being used as memory.  Obviously it would be much better for consumers if a NES flash cart used an industry standard flash card.  Also, I'd prefer a NES flash cart that was tested on a real NES as opposed to some crappy Famiclone.
<br />
<br />If NES hardware and emulator developers don't test against original NES and Famicom hardware, over many years things could drift to the point where new NES carts don't even work on a real NES!  Imagine if the NEO NES cart only worked on a Famiclone.  Sadly, many of the kiddies would suck it down.

And I seriously hope it is not an attempt to copy the powerpak. Even though it's undoutably going to suck compared to the PowerPak, I'd hate for people to buy their trash.

<br />Ugh...I almost got stung by a knockoff SNES controller once, probably made by Yobo (<a href="http://reviews.ebay.com/Selecting-a-SNES-controller_W0QQugidZ10000000001246027" class="postlink">more info</a>). There's a very small local chain of game stores that stocks a ton of these, along with many other (thankfully) obviously unlicensed accessories. I kept telling the guy running the store that they're fakes, pointing out the cheap plastic, incredibly stiff buttons, <em>misplaced sticker</em> around the 4 face buttons, and the laughably cheap cardboard box...but he kept telling me "no, they're real, they have the Nintendo logo on them" and claiming he got them from an authorized distributor, who makes them under license from Nintendo. Uh huh. I have to wonder if he was lying, or was just swindled himself when he bought them. F*ckin' shady bastards...
<br />
<br />(I did walk out with an unlicensed controller, but this one was more solidly built, cost less, and didn't try to pass itself off as an official accessory <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />)

<br />NES and GBA both use <a href="http://www.pineight.com/ds/block/" class="postlink">byte-addressable storage, as opposed to block devices such as CF and SD</a>. What is the industry-standard NOR card, other than a GBA flash cart?

<br />Hopefully the NES Powerpak has another production run, because I'd rather see it become the defacto standard flash cart for NES systems.
