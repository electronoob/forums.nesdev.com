I though you meant you were gonna make the characters 8x16 pixels big, not that they were going to be made of multiple 8x16 sprites. In this case, yes, I totally agree with you.

Many games that use mappers with 1KB or 2KB CHR bankswitching do have the main character's graphics spread across several banks, but the actual animation is not a direct consequence of the switch. In most cases, the OAM (memory that defines where the sprites are and what colors and tiles they use) is completely wiped and rewritten every frame. Each game implements its own solution, but I assume most have some sort of animation scripting system, with pointers to metasprites (the values that will be processed according to the positions of the objects they represent to generate OAM data) and timing information (how long each animation frame should be displayed).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The technique is more common on Genesis, Super NES, and Game Boy Advance, all of which have hardware-assisted copying to VRAM.<br /></div><br />But also on the Master System and B/W Game Boy, which don't have any hardware assistance (on the Master System this is almost mandatory, since it doesn't have sprite flipping), even if sometimes they have to use double buffering to avoid displaying partially updated sprites. There's one NES game I can think of, The Smurfs, which does take longer than a frame to update player patterns and doesn't do anything to hide it. The problem is clearly visible in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=mZ_2Ck1gBjQ#t=90" class="postlink">this level</a>, because of the bird's wings.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />aprox 80-90% of games : Static sprite pages that are only re-loaded / bankswitched when changing the levels (if at all)<br /></div><br />I think it's a bit less.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />aprox 10-15% of games : CHR-ROM, reserve a whole page for the main character and switch it depending on the animation frame<br /></div><br />I think it's a bit more.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />aprox 1% of games : CHR-RAM is updated as the character is animated.

With a little more effort we can probably list at least 20 games or so, which would be more than 1% of all NES games.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Jan 24, 2014 9:36 pm</p><hr />

@Okk : It's always like this, if 95% of games handles something a simple way and that 5% of them are doing it an &quot;improved&quot; way for which the hardware was not originally designed for, and requires some kind of &quot;trickery&quot;, you can bet that all Nesdev regulars (including myself) are only talking about those rare/complex cases because they're more interesting and push the system closer to its limit.<br /><br />So sprite animation is done like this :<br />aprox 80-90% of games : Static sprite pages that are only re-loaded / bankswitched when changing the levels (if at all)<br />aprox 10-15% of games : CHR-ROM, reserve a whole page for the main character and switch it depending on the animation frame<br />aprox 1% of games : CHR-RAM is updated as the character is animated. I can only think of a great total of 3 games (there's probably more) : Solstice, Battletoads and Prince of Persia.<br /><br />So tepples and tokumaru were talking as if only the two last alternatives are possible, when in fact the first one is sufficient for the vast majority of cases, but is of course less interesting on the technical plan.<br /><br />Also please note that I MADE THOSE NUMBERS UP I didn't collect them scientifically, but it is to show the idea.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Jan 24, 2014 4:59 pm</p><hr />

In general, one 32-byte update packet can update one row of nametable, one column of nametable, the entire palette, or two tiles in CHR RAM. Battletoads is an example of a game that animates the player character by updating whole frames of animation to CHR RAM, but then it also keeps rendering turned off for the top 16 or so scanlines so that it has time for a larger update. The technique is more common on Genesis, Super NES, and Game Boy Advance, all of which have hardware-assisted copying to VRAM.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Jan 24, 2014 3:09 pm</p><hr />

I mean, even if you use all 64 sprites in one frame you will only be using 128 tiles out of the 256 that are available for sprites. If you use CHR-RAM and have a dynamic pattern system that's constantly changing the tiles, the blank tiles will hardly be a problem (and they even compress to nearly nothing, which means almost no PRG-ROM wasted either). With CHR-ROM they'll certainly waste more memory, and you'll need fine bankswitching minimize the impact too, but in some cases I think they're still worth it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu Jan 23, 2014 6:42 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The advantage of designing the characters yourself is that you can more easily distribute the colors in ways that are more friendly towards the limitations of the NES (i.e. make a character wearing a blue jumpsuit and an orange helmet, so you can easily use different palettes for the body and the head).<br /></div><br />I don't know how I missed this, but this is just SO TRUE. It really helps a lot to be at the same time designer and programmer.<br />Also the nice thing with NES is that even if you're a shitty artist (I am) you still have chances to make decent use of the hardware's possibilities, something that wouldn't be possible even for SNES for example.<br /><br />Back on topic, there's no point in using 8x16 sprites if you're only making use of 8x8 inside them. With 16x16 characters, it's a reasonable choice to go with both 8x8 and 8x16 sprites. With like 16x24 characters you have to use 8x8 if you don't want to waste tiles, and if you use 16x32 or bigger you can also do with both but 8x16 would probably be more sensible, as it uses less sprites for huge objects.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Jan 23, 2014 6:08 am</p><hr />

I always draw my graphics in monochrome, and decide which palette to apply to them at a later point. Well maybe not always but almost always. You get my point.<br />Luminosity is more important than hue and saturation. When encoding an image in JPEG, they throw more bits at luminosity than colour information.<br /><br />If you see a green man you'll still recognize it's a man, but if you see a light skin coloured glue of pixels it won't look like a person even with the right colour.<br /><br />As for games showing 32 16x16 guys there is Fire Emblem (though they're not sprites), and for a lot of bullets you should look into Gradius/Life Force games.<br /><br />The limit get reached pretty quickly if you want to draw big things with sprites (as the # of sprites is proportional to the square of the object's dimensions). Look at the huge pink robot from Mega Man 5 for example, or the trax driving mettaur in Mega Man 3. They are almost eating all sprites on their own.<br /><br />Final Fantasy games are a not a good example of how palettes were handled if you ask me. Most of the time you'll have a fighter in your front row, wasting 1 palette as they are both the same. Most of the towns and dungeon uses the same palettes for 2&amp;3 as well. Result : It's as if only 2 sprite palettes were available.<br />They could at least have provided a way to have NPCs &quot;choose&quot; beteen palette 2, palette 3, or a mix of both instead of hardwiring them to having palette 2 for top and palette 3 for bottom.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jan 22, 2014 3:14 pm</p><hr />

I think the later NES Mega Man games have some pretty stunning background art, which is mostly composed of monochrome objects and given shape with shading and highlights. It also allows them to maintain strong contrast between the terrain and the background, which I think is pretty important, especially in a precision platformer. Of course, stacking sprites would give more colors, and more colors naturally means more options for graphics. Final Fantasy 1 does that bit with characters and townsfolk, where the top half uses a different palette than the bottom half. If a game uses 8x16 sprites, though, this would have the same sprite weight as stacking, at least for 16x16 objects.<br /><br />And I am leaning towards considering my sprites to be 8x16, the main selling point being more stuff within the 64 sprite limit. Now that I think about it, though, I don't recall seeing many NES games that push the sprite limit through the sheer number of objects onscreen. That is, I don't think I've seen many games that have 32 16x16 guys running around, or that have 40 or 50 bullets flying around at a time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6308">Okk</a> — Wed Jan 22, 2014 2:57 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Okk wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I think I've managed to capture the aesthetic of some early era titles, but when compared to later games, it doesn't hold up.<br /></div><br />Early games had very flat graphics, there were hardly any textures or shading. Newer games avoided big flat areas, and abused shadows and highlights, even if that meant using colors in unconventional ways. For example, look at how Blaster Master used the same gray to highlight both the grass and the dirt (looks better on a TV, because of how colors blend). You can often shade/highlight with different hues, which allows you to reuse colors more often than you'd think at first.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Maybe I should take a cue from later Mega Man titles and work with more monochrome objects.<br /></div><br />That works great if you combine sprites using different palettes in the same object, otherwise it may look too dull.<br /><br />Older characters/objects were almost as flat as the backgrounds. Newer ones are usually outlined and/or have more volume (i.e. shadows + highlights). A common trick is to use different palettes in the same object, which makes them look more colorful than is typically expected from the NES. Ideally you'll find ways to do this without overlaps (for example, the bottom and top halves use different palettes, like in Contra) but some degree of overlapping is acceptable as long as you pay attention to the sprite limit (for example, Mega Man's face is an overlap, but it's just one sprite). The advantage of designing the characters yourself is that you can more easily distribute the colors in ways that are more friendly towards the limitations of the NES (i.e. make a character wearing a blue jumpsuit and an orange helmet, so you can easily use different palettes for the body and the head).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Jan 22, 2014 11:33 am</p><hr />
