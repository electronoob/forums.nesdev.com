		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is my first post on this forum so I apologize if this is in the wrong place. I am writing a dissertation and one of the chapters looks briefly at the Atari Games Vs. NOA case involving the CIC. I have been told that Loopy reverse-engineered the CIC although I haven't had luck finding any threads here which references that. (I did find threads about reverse-engineering the Tengen Rabbit.) I am looking for an image of the NES CIC die to get a sense of what the Atari analysts were wrestling with in the 1980s trying to reverse engineer it. (I know they ended up cheating by going to the patent office but they also tried to look directly at the CIC with a microscope.) Is there a good image of the CIC die out there?

But afterwards they shrugged and used the Nintendo code to finish the job.
