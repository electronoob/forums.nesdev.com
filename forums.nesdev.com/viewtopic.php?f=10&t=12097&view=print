Fact is that NESASM does have a few shortcomings (yes, you can still make decent programs/games with it despite them, but you can't deny that the shortcomings do exist), and now, with your work, people have the option of getting started with a more versatile assembler. Thanks for that.<br /><br />Not that ASM6 is perfect, I know it has its own set of shortcomings, but it doesn't impose as much bullshit, doesn't have such a buggy history, is versatile enough to facilitate things like bankswitching and can easily be used to code for other 6502 machines.

I personally think it makes things more clear, specially if the address is a label: LDA &lt;local1. It makes it faster for scanning and reading through the source code. It also has the advantage of giving you full control, where as ASM6 forces all addresses of $0000-00ff to ZP. There are cases where you might not want ZP addressing. One could say just use a macro instruction instead (using .db xx xx), but asm6 is lacking in the macro department. <br /><br /> If I were to pick asm6 over nesasm, it be for its other options (data defines and related stuff). Not something as minor as this.

Indirection with [] wouldn't bother me as much if there wasn't a well defined standard in use for years in 6502 assembly, which is ().<br /><br />The reason I find <s>ASM6</s> NESASM bad is because it's a rehashed tool for another platform (meaning that things that are completely irrelevant to the NES were carried over, such as banks starting every 8KB) and because of its buggy history. Countless times people have had trouble assembling with NESASM because it would often produce corrupt binaries without any sort of warning under various circumstances (such as unrecognized addressing modes - it would silently pick another addressing mode -, code spilling out of banks, and so on), and when it did warn you about any errors, it was often very vague and didn't actually say what the problem was (such as .db statements with too many values in one row). Many of these problems were reported fixed in newer versions, but with such a history I could never trust a tool like this without a complete overhaul.<br /><br />EDIT: D'oh! Thanks tepples.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's been a long time, but IIRC both NESASM and PCEAS were based on Hudsons assembler for both systems, which is also why it distributed as a pair. I have no idea of the source was taken from that, but a PCE dev kit with NES/PCE assembler stuff (and source IIRC) was floating around in private circles, when this was released. Not sure if that has anything to do with the 8k bank thing or not. Anyway, I'm pretty sure that's where the [] usage came from, and other syntax stuffs.<br /><br /> That aside, if NESASM was as popular as people say, then why didn't the NES community simply <em>fix </em>the issues? Why create a whole new macro assembler? I'm not the most experienced with C/C++, but I was easily able to make changes to nesasm/pceas. The source was easy to follow and understand. This boggles my mind, because there are so many brilliant people in the NES community. Was the source <em>that </em>bad, that starting over was easier?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Something based on Hudson Soft code may draw takedowns from Konami, the current owner of Hudson Soft. And the architecture of NESASM differs so much from that of an assembler designed for use with a linker that starting ca65 fresh was as easy as if not easier than starting from NESASM. Besides, Ullrich von Bassewitz, the original author of ca65 and ld65, may not have even known about NESASM.

[/quote]<br /><br />I was thinking that too.  I just didn't want to wear out my pinkies and slow my coding down typing &gt;.  I haven't even really tried it yet, but I also saw it the other way arround.  I'm pretty sure it would confuse new coders already trying to put $ and #$ in the right place, and that that's why it wasn't mentioned in the nerdy nights.  But I think that also means there's some bloated homebrews out there.  But that doesn't matter.<br /><br />As for macros,  I haven't seen nesasm3 macros on these forums but have seen other assemblers' macros.<br /><br />Thanks for the disscusion anyways guys.  I'll give nesasm3 another shot probably, and maybe make a vi bind to insert &gt; quickly.  But I'll also check out the other assemblers again.<br /><br />edit.

Dsb 4 is less typing than Db 0,0,0,0 to take four. I was trying to do db 4.<br />The value to db is probably for asigning values at a more advanced point in the program than just variable assigning at the start.<br />Also, the readme sais enum supresses assembler.
