		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, about 6 months~a year ago, I soft modded my XBOX with Krayzie's 1.1 and put Unleash X as the user interface.  It works fine, but I was so eager to try stuff out that I just put all kinds of emulators/roms/programs/etc. on there in a haphazard way.  Now, I want to start fresh and install complete ROM sets rather than a few ROMs here and there as well as start fresh with the music and other applications.  To do this, I want to delete anything and everything that isn't critical, which is where the problem comes in.  I'm worried that I might delete a critical file and brick my XBOX.  Is this possible?  Are critical boot/runtime files blocked from deletion?  Is it possible to re-install the soft mod and erase the drive at the same time?  I'm not really worried about game saves or anything, so if anyone knows a program to do this or can confirm one way or another about the ability to delete critical files, I would appreciate it.  Also, as a side note, I don't need any smart ass replies that don't even address the question, if you don't know, just don't say anything.  I already posted this question at xboxscene, but they don't seem to know anything about it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You can erace everything on every partition if your so inclined and yes the xbox will stop working when you tern it off then back on if you do so.  I would just use a slayer disk to set your hdd back to its orginaal state then resoftmod it. At this point I would then make a backup on the xbox in this state so I could easally start over again if I feel like it. This is easer than trying to figure out what files not to erace.

<br />Personally I dont mess with soft mods since soldering in the $13 doller modchip is easyer for me, but I have done it once.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hmmm, indeed.  Well, under further evaluation, I see most of the stuff is kept in seperate partitions, so as long as I stay out of partitions I have no business snooping in, I should be OK.  
<br />
<br />As for hardware modchips, would that allow me to swap hard drives without any flashing,etc. necessary to the hard disk?  If I could just toss in a 250 GB hard drive, that would be fantastic.
