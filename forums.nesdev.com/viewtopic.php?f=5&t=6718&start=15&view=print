<br />Which explains your interest in Sonic because the Sonic games I've played don't have anything as <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=4706" class="postlink">destructible</a> as SMB's 1-2 <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />

<br />Have you played the SMS/GG games? The rings in those are defined as special blocks in the level map, so technically when you collect them you are "destroying" parts of the level map.
<br />
<br />The SMS/GG games work like that because they use a very different level format from the MD/Genesis games: it's just a 2D array of 32x32-pixel blocks uncompressed in RAM, so it's easily modifiable. This makes the levels shorter though.

<br />I'm broke, and thus unable to do it on my own.  Otherwise, I would.

<br />I think that would make the program more likely to crash though... With RTS you have a good enough chance that there's a valid address at the top of the stack, but JMP would take you to more random places.

<br />Hopefully I'll get more replies than my previous vid on here, haha.
<br />
<br />Also, I've started using a much higher quality encode, so this should be the best looking video yet, quality wise. Doesn't get much better than uploading lossless! Hah!
<br />
<br />Also, I'm going back to my regular game list after this. Next game to get corrupted will be Burai Fighter.
