The problem is that it behaves similar to a controller - send a signal to latch the status of all keyboard keys at once.  On the other hand, the USB keyboard reading routine outputs data in ASCII.  That output would need to be mapped to a 9 byte array in the CPLD that would mimic the Famicom keyboard input.  Also, implementing this would prevent the use of compatibility mode reads.  You would have to have a cart capable of sending R/W and /CE signals down EXP7 and EXP8 in order to talk to the ethernet adapter.  Then again, it may be better off going that route anyway.  Good news is that the CPLD can be updated by the user.<br /><br />No, unfortunately a CF card will not physically fit in the design.  The CPU board is designed to fit in a <a href="http://www.hammondmfg.com/pdf/1593K.pdf" class="postlink">Hammond 1593K enclosure</a>, available at Mouser for ~$3.  Plus the SD card is cheaper.  The CPU board will not cost more than $60, so I have to keep costs down where possible.<br /><br />If someone wants to add a gopher client, implement IPv6 support or use it to attach their NES to a potato gun, more power to them.  I'm a network architect during the day and my wife and I have 5 kids, a dog and a guinea pig to take care of in the evening.  What little time I do have is spent on implementing the necessary functions to make this thing work.  The release version of the firmware will support IPv4 and include the functions necessary for the NES to interact with IP hosts as well as the USB keyboard and SD card.  Not trying to sound like a jerk or anything; I just have to stay focused on the requirements to get it finished in a timely manner.  Otherwise it will never get done.<br /><br />That being said, yes, I do plan on releasing the PIC32 and CPLD source code when it's ready.  I imagine there are a number of people with the time and development skills necessary to turn this into something better.  Also, I think it would be very poor form to keep it closed.  I may be the one who took the time to design and build it, but I certainly could not have done it without the technical knowledge and ideas provided by the Nesdev community.

Currently there are no hardware flash carts that fully support any of these games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Can it be used with 60-pins cartridges as well as 72-pins cartridges? Also, if it is simpler to do so, disable the ethernet when Famicom keyboard mode is selected (so that the ethernet can only be used with ASCII keyboard mode). It could be selected by keys on the keyboard (such as scroll lock key and light, since they have nothing to do with ASCII), by a physical switch, by protocol detection, by using some command which the NES/Famicom must send to enable ASCII mode (so that Famicom mode is the default), or if it is possible to support both protocols simultaneously, whichever work better. Ensure that if Famicom keyboard emulation is used, all of the Famicom's keys are mapped whether or not you have Japanese keyboard layout on the USB keyboard.
