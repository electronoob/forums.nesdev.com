		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everyone...<br /><br />I am currently focused on the development of several homebrew game projects. The first of them is a Tetris clone (it's a project that for lack of time I have not been able to continue with its development until now) that I have called &quot;Tetris: The Soviet Mind Game&quot; in honor of the unlicensed game of the same title developed by TENGEN for NES.<br /><br />The game right now is in a very initial state however it is playable. As you can see in the following screenshots it consists of a first screen of presentation to which I would like to see some more and a menu screen in which the user can select the level of difficulty and see a screen that is accessed to a list of records.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

		<br />
	</div><br /><br />The game still has no sound effects or music and is in fact one of the immediate tasks I want to undertake. After pressing the START button you can directly access the main game screen, which is divided into two zones.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br /><br />In this second section I would like to add a score marker and another marker that reflects the level of difficulty just below the table dedicated to visualize the next piece that is offered to the player.<br /><br />To choose the next piece that is offered to the player I use a modified version of the following (very-old) program that allows to generate random numbers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhCHgO2Kaqg" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhCHgO2Kaqg</a><br /><br /><strong><span style="color: #00FF00">OLD - Random Number Generator Source Code</span></strong><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">#include &lt;gb/gb.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;rand.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;gb/console.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;gb/drawing.h&gt;<br /><br />#include &quot;pc18966_2.h&quot;<br /><br />unsigned int r,seed,key;<br /><br />void clscr();<br />void main_loop();<br />void print_title();<br />void print_marquee();<br />void print_solid_marquee();<br />void print_message_INTRO();<br />void print_message_usage();<br />void print_messageAtXY(int x, int y, char *c);<br />void plot_intro_image(unsigned char *tile_data, unsigned char *map_data);<br /><br />void main(){<br />&nbsp;

	</div><br /><br />On the other hand, apart from the typical pieces that are part of the classic Tetris game I would like to add more rare pieces like those that can be seen in some portable Tetris machines made in China. So if you have any idea of a Tetris piece design that meets these characteristics, please indicate how they are to be added to the final set. Since the game is still under development so any idea or contribution is allowed.<br /><br />I put the link to a video that shows the current state of the game: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUUcIghRsts" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUUcIghRsts</a>

I like a Tetris game with 1 cell a frame delayed auto shift.<br /><br />I press right. The piece moves one cell to the right. If I continue to hold right for say... 6 to 12 frames, the piece begins shifting right at one cell a frame.<br /><br />The slowest auto shift I can stand is Tetris DX which seems to be one cell every three frames. If you do nothing else, please consider fast delayed auto shift.<br /><br />In case you're <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoU0DQh7zdU" class="postlink">willing to go nuts with modern mechanics</a>, I recommend reading about <a href="https://tetris.wiki/ARS" class="postlink">TGM rotation</a> (specifically its wallkicks which are for the most part intuitive and fair, while not allowing silly things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPPEXMM25lA" class="postlink">other wall kicks</a><br /><br />Also about an <a href="https://tetris.wiki/IRS#IRS" class="postlink">initial rotation system</a>. Even if you don't plan to <a href="https://youtu.be/96Bw_HI1Uvw" class="postlink">max the speed of the game</a>, all of these quality of life things are pretty nice. I really miss the stuff once it's not there, coming from Tetris Grand Master. <br /><br />I make this humble post because so many people close Tetris not realizing how much more one can do than Game Boy Tetris.

More than a few of the same piece in a row will feel wrong even if it's perfectly viable. More importantly though, it just isn't fun to deal with. <br /><br />The NES version of Tetris is more &quot;fair&quot; than pure random, but only to a certain extend - You still have absolutely no way to guess what the next piece will be after the current preview. The GB version is very similar, but the RNG method is extremely bad, and it's always biased in favor of some pieces over others.<br />The TGM series takes the reroll to a much larger degree, rerolling multiple times and remembering the last four pieces instead of just the last one. The result is a Tetris game that's much easier to deal with on low gravity, but the game amps up the difficulty in other areas instead.<br /><br />There's a TON of really deep theory behind a simple seeming game like Tetris. A lot of minor things matter a lot to people who play Tetris on a high level. Stuff like how long it waits before spawning a piece after a previous one locks, how the pieces rotate, how fast the pieces move when you hold down left or right, or how long it needs to &quot;charge&quot; before it starts repeating. Even minor differences tends to make a big impact on gameplay in a game like this, which is why people have very strong opinions on the various different implementations of Tetris.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You might want to call it &quot;the soviet mind game&quot; instead of the full title for legal reasons.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The thing about the field size and piece set is really up for debate and has indeed spawned many debates since that verdict - many people, myself included, would defend the fact that the playfield dimensions (10x20) and available pieces (literally every single possible shape you can make with a tetramino) are pretty much a mathematical requirement for the game concept to work - a concept which they do not own a patent for. As such, it seems like a gross mistake to consider these aspects a part of the Tetris copyright.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure, however, that The Tetris Company have never sued anyone who haven't tried to make money off the concept. Stuff like Cultris and Nullpomino still exists and never had a lot of issues as far as I'm aware.<br /><br /><br />And yeah, calling Tetris a &quot;sport&quot; while at the same time defending the exclusive rights to license anything playing like it, is just repulsive.

The GB version is very similar, but the RNG method is extremely bad, and it's always biased in favor of some pieces over others. The TGM series takes the reroll to a much larger degree, rerolling multiple times and remembering the last four pieces instead of just the last one. The result is a Tetris game that's much easier to deal with on low gravity, but the game amps up the difficulty in other areas instead.</strong></span><br /></div><br /><br />Okay. Thank you for providing such good information regarding the random generation of parts.

However today you can find repositories of source code with the implementation of Tetris made in languages such as Java or C / C ++. These Tetris clones use the same set of pieces as the original. In any case this makes me rethink things about the game.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For <em>RHDE</em>, whose build phase closely resembles that of <em>Rampart</em>, I decided to reverse engineer the rules by which the pieces in <em>Rampart</em> were chosen, so that they aren't considered quite as arbitrary of a set (and thus not as large of a creative effort). I ended up with &quot;pentominoes and smaller polyominoes that fit in a 3x3 box and don't contain the O tetromino&quot;. I imagine that Atari Games rejected the O because it produces an undesirable 2-cell-thick wall and rejected pieces that don't fit in 3x3 because it would complicate movement and rotation.<br /><br />Robert Pelloni made a <em>Tetris</em> clone for his RPG <em>Bob's Game</em> that used an 8x16 field (like <em>Dr. Mario</em>) and the six trikings instead of the seven tetrominoes. Polykings are like polyominoes except that blocks can also be connected diagonally.

And then, is not Tetris; it is a superset.

There's a perfect mathematical beauty to Tetris where everything matches up perfectly and ensures an incredible depth to the puzzle that makes up the game.<br />A lot of pople see Tetris as a fun casual game, but there's really a lot more to the game. Add or remove two cells from the width of the playfield and you have a completely different puzzle that might be fun to play for a while but in no way has the same absurd lastability as the classic Tetris recipe.<br /><br />The thing is - <strong>game mechanics can't be copyrighted</strong>. It might sound a bit absurd, but you can make a complete copy of an existing game as long as you don't use any recognizable assets that should be considered a part of the game's copyright. Of course, what constitutes a copyrightable asset is a grey area, but since the selection of pieces and the dimensions of the playfield are central to the game mechanics of Tetris, I think it's dead wrong to consider them as such, and the court that made the descision referenced by tepples failed to see this.<br />This robs any other developers the opportunity of creating a competing Tetris styled puzzle game that is better than the officially licensed games, and the reality of the situation is exactly that now we are stuck with official releases which are absolutely horrible for competitive single player gameplay due to a ridiculously stupid ruleset being enforced by The Tetris Company.<br />Yes, this is how much people care about Tetris.

One with the traditional pieces, another that exclusively uses the rare pieces and another way that tries to mix the two sets of pieces.<br /><br />I hope I can bring a DEMO with the progress soon.
