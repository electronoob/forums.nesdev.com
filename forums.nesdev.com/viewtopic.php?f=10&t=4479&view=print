		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, long time lurker, just not getting into things. I figured I'd start by making repros of games I wanted (Mini Putt, Rockman Exile and Earthbound Zero to start) before delving into programming. However I've hit a snag.
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm used to soldering and have all the burning tools needed and whatnot but a few questions that I can't find answers to but I'm sure are easy.
<br />
<br />1) I have a pure-USB willem programmer - however do I still need an AC adapter to burn the flash/eproms properly or does the USB power do the job itself? Remember - pure usb not the parallel based ones.
<br />
<br />If I need one, where is a good place to get it?
<br />
<br />
<br />2) The soldering act itself is quite easy for me, I'm a veteran of region modding saturns and psx's and whatnot. However the following directions seem to stump me:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Solder pin 2 to hole 24 (A16)<br />Solder pin 24 to GND (OE)<br />Solder pin 30 to hole 1 (A17)</div>
<br />
<br />I can do the wiring and soldering. But here's what I can't seem to grasp.
<br />
<br />I know where the pins are but...
<br />
<br />where's hole 24/A16? - is one label easier than the other to find?
<br />how do I know where the GND spots are?
<br />same with hole 1/A17
<br />
<br />any help?
<br />
<br />-AB+

<br />
<br />Holes refer to the Hole the ROM leg/pin goes into I would think. You need a cartridge and/or ROM pinout to tell which pins of the ROM are which connection. They should be on the main NESDEV page.
<br />
<br />We have a bunch of members that have done this, I'm sure they can elaborate more on this.

<br />
<br />So... when you solder "pin x" to "Hole y" you're really soldering one pin to another? Oh wait... is that why you cut the traces too? If so, I think that fills in a gap in my soldering logic.
<br />
<br />This is always my problem, my brain gets steps 1, 2, 5 and 6... and 3 and 4 will make no sense to me, if that makes any sense to anyone else.

<br />
<br />I think the best thing is to solder the chip in there without bending any pins. Instead carefully cutting traces and rewiring the board is nicer I think. But you know whatever works for you. 
<br />
<br />As I said, there are experienced people here, hopefully one will reply with advice. I haven't built any reproduction carts.

<br />
<br />One of the reasons the instructions sometimes say Hole  rather than pin, is that for some boards you are putting a 32 pin eprom where a 28 pin one used to be (for me, I just get a 32 pin donor board).  I think some UNROM boards are like this.
<br />
<br />For Mini Putt you will be using SLROM.  You are probably using 256 KB chips (since they are cheapest)  even though the PRG and CHR are only 
<br />128 KB.  So remember to double up those pieces (in DOS you can do this like this:  copy /b theFile  /b theFile /b theDestFile  ).  Don't write 128 KB to a 256 KB chip.
<br />
<br />One thing you might consider doing is creating a dev cart and only having to re-wire the socket.  This is a good way to find out if you have burned the eproms correctly.   If you go that route, don't use the "tooled" sockets, just the cheaper "normal" ones.  the legs on the tooled ones cannot be bent without snapping them off.

<br />
<br />
<br />How would one make an all-around dev-cart though? Considering all the mappers... I was thinking of making a socketed version of each board revision (including alternates, I know there's a few revs of MMC1 and MMC3) but this may get kind of silly. Is an all around dev-cart even possible?
<br />
<br />For those with the USB version of the willem (where it's purely usb, no parallel connection) how would you up it to 12.5V, or would it happen naturally when you choose 27C256?

<br />Yes, it's called PowerPak.
<br />
<br />Other than that, no. But if you use a few different Nintendo-made boards you should be able to run most of the US games. There are tons of UNROM games, and a dev-cart is easy to make (you should also make a UOROM while you're at it). If you make another one out of a complete MMC3 board such as TKROM, most MMC3 games should work. Maybe a CHR-RAM MMC3 cart would be good too. Maybe you could do the same with 2 MMC1 boards. That should get you covered for a lot of games.

<br />I'm just curious about your comment.  What do you infer? The powerpak is maybe not suitable for dev purpose? Or he cannot produce them anymore?
<br />
<br />I'm still going to make my own dev cart once I can get back my soldering iron (left it abroad). Can't wait.

<br />Thanks. The whole scheme of a product only being available for 3 days every 90 without any sort of preorder just freaks <em>me</em> out, and it might remind some people of the alleged "engineered shortages" of the Wii console.
