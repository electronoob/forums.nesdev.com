There are different components of latency though; there's the driver latency which is (probably) unavoidable, and the viewing/capture program latency.<br /><br />Some viewing/capture programs (e.g. WinTV) add to the latency so are not very useful for interactive use. DScaler and the Microsoft amcap.exe don't seem to add much latency, so it's worth trying one of those.<br /><br />Also, capture devices with hardware compression are unsuitable for interactive use since they can add several seconds latency. And the image quality is degraded of course.<br /><br />With at least some devices, you may have better luck using Linux rather than Windows. For example, I have a Pinnacle Systems PCTV USB2. In Windows, the driver adds some latency. Maybe only half a second but that's still far too high. However using it in Linux with tvtime, there was no noticeable latency.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Wed Oct 26, 2011 4:11 am</p><hr />

Yep. :( And sadly I doubt Wine is good enough to run DScaler under Linux or whatever.<br /><br />What program have you been using to view video signals on your PC? I've tried tvtime in Linux and that doesn't reduce the frame rate.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Tue Oct 25, 2011 11:32 am</p><hr />

I have a PAL NES and a PAL SNES here.<br /><br />I've used different devices to get the NES video onto my computer and the results were always pretty bad.<br />First a USB device often called Logilink Video Grabber. I say "often called", because there is a variety of devices by different companies using the same hardware and driver. Some of you might know it under the name EasyCap Audio/Video Grabber.<br />This thing sucks!<br />It has really bad latency and colors are altered.(Suprisingly only when using an NES/SNES, PS2 looks fine).<br />Also sometimes there were weird color artifacts appearing in the picture. We all know the vertical lines of the NES 2. Imagine the same horizontally and with broader lines. It seems to happen on very light colors more often, than on darker ones.<br />Audio is awful. Most of the time, I can get it to work properly. If it does it's distorted.<br /><br />Now, I use a PCI TV-card (I think it was made by Typhoon, but it shows up as a Phillips device when I run lspci) which has an Audio-In(never got that to work, not even on Windows with the original driver) and a composite Video-In.<br />It's old, but it works okay. There is no (noticeable) latency, but the colors are somewhat of again, but not as bad as with the Logilink device.<br />Btw, I'm comparing the colors to what I see, whenever I get a chance to use my NES on a TV(I don't have...doesn't mean I never get to use one), not what can be seen in emulators.<br /><br />There is one catch though.<br />As far as I know, it does support both PAL and NTSC signal (as well as SECAM I think, but really I have only tried PAL).<br />The problem is, it only shows you half the frames of the input.<br />That means I only get 25 fps from my consoles and all intentional flicker effects or fast color changes are blurred out.<br />Prime example is Megaman 2. Whenever you get a new weapon after defeating a robot master, Megaman is shown on the screen rapidly changing his suit's color for a moment.<br />I only get to see him in a mixture of both colors.<br /><br /><br />Maybe I just should have spend more money on the devices and maybe I should have made sure that I get something of actual quality, but for me the TV-card does the job, until I can get a good TV and until I have the room for it.<br />However, If you have the chance to use a TV or you really want a quality picture and not all the hassle with the drivers/programs just to get bad video, then I'd say, don't go with this method unless you really know that what you're getting is top quality.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4824">Grumskiz</a> — Mon Oct 24, 2011 1:33 pm</p><hr />

PCI (Express) capture cards should give lower latency than USB capture devices, but some USB devices give a very acceptable result. You can buy them for a few dollars on eBay.<br /><br />Check out <a href="http://deinterlace.sourceforge.net/" class="postlink">DScaler</a>. DScaler's "Old Game" deinterlacer works pretty well for 240p sources. If you configure DScaler to use a 480p full-screen resolution and connect your PC to your display the result should be pretty good.<br /><br />I've been working on some improvements to DScaler but they're not quite ready for public consumption yet. (Example: variable brightness scanline effect, blend with previous field so flickering effects like the Batman intro show with no flickering, a "NES mode" for the temporal comb filter.)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=316">mark_k</a> — Mon Oct 24, 2011 12:27 pm</p><hr />

Also I can't find info on their site if it has composite input or only component.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">uestion #2, how difficult would it be to build a device like that from scratch? I should be able to get Altera DE2 FPGA board from school, could it be used for the signal conversion?

Does your TV have VGA input? If so the DE2 has everything you need.</div><br />Cool, thanks, I think I'll give it a go.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=80">thefox</a> — Tue Nov 30, 2010 4:35 am</p><hr />
