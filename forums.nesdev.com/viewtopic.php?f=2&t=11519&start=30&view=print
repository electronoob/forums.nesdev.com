This wiki is indeed a group effort. I'm going to see if I can find anything at all definitive with the unknown bytes besides the observations I've made. Even though they're accurate, I still am not 100% sure on anything concerning those bytes. Just that I *think* it's an ID. (Something crazy like the Nintendo employee who authenticated the game or something...Since so many random games share the exact same byte data with no correlation whatsoever. If that unlikely scenario is true, or something dealing with &quot;inside&quot; knowledge, then we may never know unless someone goes to Japan and asks an employee for info. That is, if the creator of the FDS is even still alive.)

The issue is whether they even still have those docs or not. The most optimistic bet would be to hope that one pops up for auction like on Yahoo Japan or something to that extent. I would say this is the best bet because we've received FDS betas/protos from people like this. The issue is, if such docs do indeed exist, who has them and what they would sell for.

On the Disk Writer machine, the images may have been similar to that format and the current FDS format as the gaps and crcs would be just constructed during writing. It's not like this information is important for the software. But having that data in the image file would make emulation more straight forward. When I started to add FDS support to one of my emulator projects I didn't have clear information on gaps and CRCs. I ended up HLEing the BIOS function call for LoadFiles(). <br /><br />It was less complex than putting together hacks for simulating gaps and avoiding any touching of the CRC.

They DO all start with 49... <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://brog.engrish.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/barcode-image2.jpg">http://brog.engrish.com/wp-content/uplo ... image2.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Maybe that's why that guy on the Japanese site drew that conclusion?<br /><br />But I still doubt that's even a country code for this reason. I own two brand new, sealed FDS disks. One of SMB1 and one of SMB2J. Here are their bar codes: SMb1 = T4902370500134 SMB2J = T4902370500356<br /><br />If that is indeed the header to a barcode BCD (those 5 unknown bytes following the $49, $61, $00, $00, $02 string) They don't add up to anything and do not follow the outline of points that I listed, earlier.<br /><br />These two games start with $49 and $02 in it, but where is the 61 in this case? Unless it's BCD for 1986 (25+61). The year FDS was published. So... that would mean first byte of barcode (area code or $49, then $61 [year FDS was publish in BCD], two $00, then the $02, the next byte following all FDS games in barcode after $49).

Good find! I wonder what hex number black disks were given? I may need to look up which games used black disks later.<br /><br />@Everyone<br /><br />I uploading a similar list to that of page 2 on this topic. This time I will use neater notes and only list games that are same in those 5 unknown bytes which have an obvious pattern or are consecutive with the 2nd and 4th bytes.<br /><br />Please take a minute to compare 2nd and 4th bytes, here. Reading the notes won't hurt, either.<br /><br />EDIT: These are NEWER, revised notes.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Shanem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Observations:<br /><br />This list is divided into like bytes of the 1st, 3rd and 5th, bytes:<br />1) The 1st byte in every set is always either $00 or $06.<br />2) The 2nd byte in every set appears to be in hex format, as it makes use of A-F (VERY heavily on Set3). The 2nd byte on all the sets except for 3, 7 and 8 are less than $80. All the 2nd bytes on Set3, Set7 and Set8 are greater than $80. So, judging from what we know that the 2nd byte in sets 3, 7 and 8 are ALL greater than $80 (%10000000), and the other sets are ALL less than $80 (so, $7F %01111111 or less). Is it safe to say that this is some sort of bit check? <br />3) The 3rd byte in every set has a value between $00-$06; it is never greater than $06.<br />4) The 4th byte in every set appears to represent something in decimal, as it never makes use of A-F. This byte doesn't care about being greater or less than anything.<br />5) The 5th byte in every set is never greater than $02. (The only games that make use of $02 for this byte are games which date 1988 or later. Every other set has $00 or $01 for the 5th byte. )</div><br /><br />Here are the similar/sequential/consecutive games from each set:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Shanem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Set1:<br />Moero Twinbee (Side A).........................$06 $05 $04 $00 $01<br />Exciting Billiard (side B).........................$06 $05 $04 $00 $01<br />Dr. Chaos: Jigoku no Tobira (side B)...........$06 $06 $04 $01 $01<br />Armana no Kiseki (side B).......................$06 $07 $04 $02 $01<br />Aspic: Majaou no Noroi (side B):……………......$06 $0b $04 $06 $01<br /><br />Yumi Koujou Doki Doki Panic (side A)......$06 $13 $04 $10 $01<br />Monty on the Run (Side A).....................$06 $16 $04 $13 $01<br />Armana no Kiseki (side A)......................$06 $18 $04 $15 $01<br />Adian no Tsue (Side A)..........................$06 $19 $04 $16 $01<br /><br />Youkai Yashiki (Side A)..........................$06 $21 $04 $20 $01<br />Exciting Baseball (side A).......................$06 $29 $04 $28 $01<br /><br />Aspic: Majaou no Noroi (side A):………………$06 $33 $04 $34 $01<br />Family Com.
