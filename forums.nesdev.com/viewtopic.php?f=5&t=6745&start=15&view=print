<br />Avast will make your PC feel like 10 year older PC. It even made my PC crash when it ran while an emulator was already running. In other words, wathever you do avoid avast at all cost - you'd rather want a virused PC than a PC with avast installed.
<br />
<br />I feel like security became much of a lobby - companies use hackers and virus to sell their programs. Just like people use illness to sell medicine - when in fact you recover the same no matter whether or not you take any medicine. The comparison between computer viruses and real life viruses couldn't be any closer.
<br />
<br />Now I don't deny that viruses and hackers DO exist and CAN be dangerous. I just point out that many people probably exaggerate the danger in order of magnitude to create a lobby.

<br />
<br />In my experience Mcafee really slowed down my machine and did not even offer very good protection but Norton dose not have a very large performance impact even on my old 1.5ghz and actually protects my computers.

Although <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/" class="postlink">Sandboxie</a> isn't free, it can be used indefinitely, it will at most show you a nag screen every once in a while. With that you can visit as many porn/RoMz/WaReZ sites as you want and never give a shit about any threats.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Norton dose not have a very large performance impact even on my old 1.5ghz</div><br />Or maybe you just don't see the difference because you never used the same computer without such bloatware.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">and actually protects my computers.</div>
<br />IMO, anti-virus programs are like just the Easter bunny or Santa Claus. They give a fake sense of security, because when shit gets real ugly they can never restore the previous stability of your system. They might even get rid of the viruses, but your system always gets crippled in some way. When damage is done, it's done.
<br />
<br />And the eternal race between new threats and definition updates is something really annoying to be caught in. I'd much rather not care about being infect at all and just wipe everything out in one go, like is possible with sandboxes, virtual machines and reboot-to-restore.

<br />
<br /> Nothing is perfect but decent virus scans can protect your computer from many of the threats that are out there with minimal effort on your part.
<br />
<br />personally I like having persistence in the changes I make intentionally and would not want everything reset every time I restart or have to remember to tell the computer to keep the changes I wanted to make.
<br />I would much rather use a virus scan and keep a backup of my OS in a state that is more of less how I want it in case its necessary.

<br />Unless you're running IE in what amounts to an emulator that isolates the browser from the rest of Windows. Such containers can be as light as Sandboxie or as heavy as VirtualBox.
<br />
<br />No virus scanner yet has found the 84 viruses in my copy of Dr. Mario.

Any program running inside it (that includes programs started from programs running inside it) can't affect the hard disk at all. All disk writes are redirected to images that can be discarded later, so it really is 100% safe to do anything while browsing the web if your browser is running in a sandbox.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">personally I like having persistence in the changes I make intentionally and would not want everything reset every time I restart or have to remember to tell the computer to keep the changes I wanted to make.</div><br />Except for files I download and documents I work on, I rarely want to keep anything from session to session, and for these cases you can always mark certain folders as permanent. I rarely install new programs, but even when I do I would like the first time to not be for real, so I can evaluate the program and be able to get rid of it without leaving any traces in case it wasn't what I was expecting.<br /><br />Honestly I wouldn't even care if things like browsing history were wiped every time I rebooted my computer. I could very well keep all my relevant links elsewhere and not have to rely on the browser trying to guess where I want to go.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I would much rather use a virus scan and keep a backup of my OS in a state that is more of less how I want it in case its necessary.</div>
<br />Then it's a good thing that both of us are happy with the different solutions we use.

<br />Ban "user" is a good idea after checking there ip and being reasonably sure they are not a real person, but this is already done. locking the topic could be done in a case by case basis.
<br />
<br />I think the policy of common sense the moderators here already follow covers these situation.

<br />
<br />What I hate to do is delete the first post in a thread.  If it's that bad I prefer to delete the whole thread, which also means in a few cases, some amusing joke replies to spammers have been nuked with it.  That's really the main approach I've used over the years to make the place seem spam-free.  And trying to get to it before there are replies.  But this one was sneakier than most.
