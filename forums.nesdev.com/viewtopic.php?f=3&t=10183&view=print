STOP doing this, for several reasons:<br />1) I don't like it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Personally I think it feels like &quot;cheating&quot; in some way..<br />2) It's bad for people doing homebrew/ROM-hacking (like myself). Try hacking VS-ROMs and play them in FCEUX and see what happens. Nothing, they won't work properly because checksums doesn't match the builtin database and you don't get correct VS-functionality.<br /><br />What do you guys think about this? Am I the only one upset about this stuff?

The only way is that you start a VS-Zapper game, inject your own code (copy'n' paste to RAM), or hack your own ROM to match a CRC-value already in the VS-Zapper database. <br />I think Nintendulator behave in a similar way..

That information includes the exact functioning specifications of every single mapper chip, plus how they're all connected, and more.  A real NES never has to guess what variety of mapper chip is on your particular board, or whether there's a resistor at R5.  It knows.  Why should emulators not be allowed to know the same things?<br /><br />As far as modified ROMs go, there have been some efforts made in Bizhawk to help out with those sorts of things.  If there's something in particular that you need help with for a particular project, I'll see what I can do.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />He specifically doesn't like using a checksum to ID a ROM image. Emulators ideally should be told about special cases in the header. The problem is that iNES has been around forever and expanded apon. Many people still have and distribute roms with bad or older headers. So it's up to the emulator to just fail or try to do additional checks to allow things to successfully load. <br /><br />iNES 2.0 probably nails a number of special cases but the problem is the games that need this info already exist with older iNES headers that don't mention the additional information. So unless the user updates their header, it won't work. In theory though if you are a hacker, you should update the header and then the checksum will pass for the older header roms, and your hacked rom will specifically tell the emulator what to do. So it all works if the emulator supports the newer iNES header and acts on it. <br /><br />There's also nothing wrong with a checksum/hash to detect certain games. However you'll have problems with hacks if you are hashing *everything*. Instead you could pick a portion of rom to hash that is unlikely to change in a hack, but still unique.

It's the cart itself that does all the magic, and since the cart (board, mapper, wiring, etc.) is missing from the emulator + ROM combination, the emulator has to get that information from somewhere in order to properly simulate the cart. Using the contents of the ROM to know what cart to simulate is a poor way of solving the problem, for the reasons oRBIT2002 mentioned.

You can usually tell what it is based on what the game tries to do (barring copy protections.)<br /><br />The bigger problem I faced was with things like save states and auto-rewind snapshots. Dynamically changing the amount of RAM the cartridge supports means you have to be extra careful when serializing and unserializing data. A bit heavy-handed to just always dump 128KB of &quot;any RAM&quot; into all save states ...

The emulated system, by which I mean the combination of the deck and the inserted cartridge, does not do any guessing, any heuristics, any fuzzy logic.  While it's true that the NES deck itself does not know anything about the internals of the cart, all relevant internals are exposed by the sequence of data reads from the PPU and CPU buses, as well as cart interrupt timing.  There's no uncertainty.<br /><br />While it's true that hashing doesn't match what the console does, hashing does mach certain facts of life:  Whenever a particular PRG ROM+CHR ROM combo was encountered on manufactured cartridges, it was always on a particular board (or one from a short list of particular board.)  The most correct solution would be to put information in the ROM header, I agree; but that's not done, so pointless to talk about it from the point of view of what emulators should implement.

Maybe everyone assumes 8KB PRG is enough for Galaxian, and then a 4KB PRG ROM is discovered later on. You never know.<br /><br />To me, the problem is trying to fit the whole game into a single file, and compressing all of this rich metadata about the PCB into this 16-byte header that has to work around a legacy mid-'90s header format.<br /><br />I'd rather separate the ROM and the description of the PCB itself. And then allow that description to be stored in an extensible format (JSON, XML, ...) so that when something new comes up, we can support it.<br /><br />From there, I'd probably keep a database of every commercial game internally, so that all commercial games can just load and play, regardless of whether there's an iNES 1.0 or 2.0 header, or not. And then require the external description to load homebrew. If it has to be one file, store the ROM and the description both inside a ZIP archive.<br /><br />But now you have another problem. All the Javascript emulators are going to want to use JSON. MESS is going to want to use its own proprietary XML format. Nestopia has its own XML format. I use BML myself.<br /><br />Even if we agreed to store external board descriptions in an extensible format, and even if we all agreed on a specific markup language, and even if we all somehow agreed on what tags to make and what to name them, we'd still run into issues where certain parsers had bugs, so a file that doesn't end in a line feed works on emulator A, but not emulator B.<br /><br />Nobody who has already made homebrew would go back to make this board layout, and few people making new homebrew would want to make layouts for the dozen different emulators.<br /><br />So I've pretty much come to the conclusion that there is no solution to this problem.<br /><br />Support iNES 1.0, support iNES 2.0, support as many external board markups as you can, support an internal database, cross your fingers and hope for the best.
