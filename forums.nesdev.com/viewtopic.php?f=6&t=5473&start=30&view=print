<br />I never made it.

This is actually from a tracker, and the pitches aren't exact, though the waveforms are.

<br />Did they really get it wrong like this when building the 2A07, or is the information on the wiki incorrect? If I had a PAL NES to test I'd verify it myself, but as I can't, can anyone else verify it for me?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Clocking an LFSR is equivalent to multiplying by <em>x</em> in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field" class="postlink">finite field</a>. Probably the most accessible description of how multiplication works in a finite field, the one I read when first trying to understand how Reed-Solomon error correction works, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic" class="postlink">"Finite field arithmetic" on Wikipedia</a>. It's not graduate math, but it might be undergraduate math. And if you do anything with RS codes, you'll have to wrap your head around it sooner rather than later.
<br />
<br />An 8-bit LFSR operates in the finite field GF(256). (Here, I use "integer" for an ordinary whole number and "bit pattern" for an element of a finite field.) What you're looking for is the number that when multiplied by 00000010 <em>n</em> times results in 00000001, so because 00000010 to the 255th power is 00000001, you'll want to take 00000010 to the power of (255 - <em>n</em>).
<br />
<br />Please let me know which sentence in this post was the first sentence that you failed to understand.
<br />
<br />There are ways of calculating the powers of 00000010. One is to build a lookup table from integers <em>n</em> to bit patterns 00000010^<em>n</em>. Building this table requires O(n) multiplications, but the resulting "log table" can be reused at O(1) each for multiple entries, such as the 32 entries in the length counter LUT or the 16 entries in the noise or DMC period LUT. The RS module in a typical QR barcode library generally uses this method for GF(256). The other, which is faster but may be hard to understand for people who don't know finite fields well, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring" class="postlink">exponentiation by squaring</a>. This requires only O(log n) multiplications per table entry that's actually used.

<br />There exist more than one primitive reducing polynomial for each field size, and some field sizes need more than two taps. That is, there exist more than one valid set of taps for each LFSR length. One can find tables of such polynomials for each order. But even though (say) QR and DataMatrix use different polynomials, people speak of "the" GF(256), or "the" finite field with 256 elements, because there's an isomorphism between any two fields of the same order with different polynomials.

<br />Sorry, what I meant was, "In the silicon, is each LUT one specific seed and one specific set of taps and entry N is contents of the LFSR when clocked N times?" You explained how to find the seed given the taps; is there an method for finding the taps?

<br />The taps depend on the length of the LFSR. A table of taps for each length can be found in any book on finite field theory, and there are <a href="http://theory.cs.uvic.ca/gen/poly.html" class="postlink">online tools to find them</a>. For most lengths, two or four taps are used. For example, the polynomial x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1 is primitive, and it leads to an 8-bit 4-tap LFSR. That polynomial corresponds to the entry 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 when you tell the tool to generate "Primitive polynomials over GF(2), n = 8".

<br />
<br />Well, why did they choose these notes? Well, C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C (speed 0-8) is the major C scale, and C-E-G-C is a major C chord (speed 12-15), but what about C-D-F-G-A-C (speed 8-12) ?
<br />
<br />First thing to note is that it's a kind of a scale, the <strong>pentatonic</strong> scale (F pentatonic scale to be more precise). The special thing about it is that it doesn't have any semitones or tritones, so it always sounds good. I noticed that the church's bells are C-D-F-G-A-C at the one near my girlfriend's parents, and it's never dissonant.
<br />
<br />More interesting aspect however, is that C-D-F-G-A-C is actually the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slendro" class="postlink">Slendro</a> scale used in some oriental music (indonesian gamelan music). That might be why these notes were used.
<br />
<br />EDIT: removed a non-intentional smiley.

<br />
<br />I don't think Slendro is a reasonable candidate, though. Its tuning is very different from 12-TET, and we've already determined that the DPCM frequencies are all tuned to A-440 12-TET. It only looks like the pentatonic scale when you approximate it in 12-TET.
