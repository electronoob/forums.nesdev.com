As I understand it, a mask ROM is a big fat decoder/mux/whatever to wires that are either connected or not connected. (The CIC reverse engineering thread tells more.) It would succumb to bit rot at the same rate that any other non-writable integrated circuit, such as the instruction decoder of a CPU, succumbs to bit rot.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Mar 14, 2010 8:30 am</p><hr />

Flash is the worst video player out there.

If more people used Windows Media Player plugin pointed to a FLV file, I'd be much happier.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Sat Mar 13, 2010 8:20 am</p><hr />

I see. Me I would say the opposite: to have good replacement for your original nes would be a lot more useful than some hardware that can play nes rom. Most clone are crap so a real replacement would be great.  By using real cart, you don't have to emulate any mappers at all and some mappers are not even emulated yet in the powerpak because of their complexity. <br /><br />If your goal is only to play rom, a computer emulator or a nes + powerpak does exactly that but that's my opinion.  I'm sure a lot more people would be grateful if it was a real clone that work like the real thing. Add the possibility to play famicom audio with famicom carts (meaning 1 slot for US-NES and one for famicom) and that' even better.  Of course, it should be a top loader, not that horrible idea that was the toaster nes.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Another point: if you can make a real clone and then make some real mappers with carts for homebrew then you just prolonged the nes life span even more.  I would like the see a clone that is well made and not some junk that feels like it will break in your hands the minute you will use it. I'm sure many people would be looking forward to that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sat Mar 13, 2010 3:44 am</p><hr />

I just want to confirm what exactly you're doing since I didn't read all the details on your blog.<br /><br />You're doing a nes emulator in hardware, right? But are you planing to make it like a machine that can play cartidges or just a machine that can run roms? From all you comments about "I need to make mappers work", I guess you're going for the later.  Why is that so?  Just curious.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Sat Mar 13, 2010 2:33 am</p><hr />

This latest one is in regards to my APU DMC module progress.
