<br />Ok thanks, i tried using it with the rom i burnt though and while it still froze the text wasn't all garbled like it was on my nes..... 
<br />
<br />Il try a few more roms and if no go then i will just play the good translation on an emu. Id rather use a emu than put up with the appalling proto translation on the actual hardware.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is a few patches on <a href="http://www.romhacking.net" class="postlink">http://www.romhacking.net</a> that will fix it I belive. (there was a thread about it some time ago so if you use search you might find the details about what went wrong when they coded the intro).
<br />
<br />If you want to play FF2, I seriously recommend you play the "Demonic Panemodium" patch from romhacking.net, because the original games really suffers from terrible flaws that makes it unplayable : At first the game is quite good but after a while there is HUGE gaps in strenght of enemies each time you make progress, the item inventory is VERY limited (and key-items quickly take a hell of the low space availalble), and you'll find youself having to go trough a dungeon of 8 floors with frequent battles with enemies who have a 1/2 change to poison/blind your party members, when you can only carry ~10 eyedrops/anditotes/potion ALLTOGETHER.
<br />
<br />Because of the huge gaps between enemies strenght, and the lack of a true EXP system, the "weak" enemies will never make your characters progress anymore (they might even REGRESS), and the "strong" enemies will wipe them out in an instant.
<br />
<br />Now seriously FF1 and FF3 are really THE games to play on NES. I don't quite like FF2, altough they were good ideas in it they were poorly executed. It's only pros is that it is one of the first games ever made that had a "true" storyline, but to be honest it's not that good. (WARNING PARTIAL SPOILERS FOLLOW) it's basically everyone dying until the 4 party members are the only humans still living in the world, and then they kick the big bad villain ass.
<br />All those problems were fixed in remakes, and I think the hack partially fixes them as well (but it won't give you an unlimited inventory for example).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, i had a crack at it yesterday. First i used kogami's plans....Blue garbled screen. 2nd used the other plans on the main site...worked perfectly but kept freezing after like 10seconds of turning it on.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> 
<br />
<br />I kept playing with it trying to get it to work and broke one of the nes's connectors  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> (I think because i  solderered the wire too far down pin 56)
<br />
<br />Ive ordered a new connector and hopefully it should work without further modification.
<br />
<br />Il post pics of the second one i make for you as this one has many unnecessary wires( from using 2 different sets of plans) and is very ugly and confusing to look at.

<br />
<br />Ive got the battery in a little round holder. Ive got gnd going staight to pin 14 and have the postive going to &gt;&gt;Diode&gt;&gt;Resistor&gt;&gt; pin 28.  I didn't bend up pin 28 and left it connected to the board. Was that my problem? Also the ring on the diode was facing towards pin 28 so im pretty sure the polarity is correct.
<br />
<br />Edit : Decently NOT lifting pin 28. I tried that and there is no sound and the graphics are all garbled

<br />
<br />I would post pics now but im pretty close to the end (Its a huuuuuge game for the nes) and it took me ages to get it working properly on my nes due to the crappy connector. If i took it out of the cart slot now id never get it working again.
<br />
<br />Im going to make a second one tommorow and il post some pics for you then
<br />
<br />Also, for those who have played it before, is it normal for there to be a bunch of garbled blue mess above the world map when you use the magic "sight"? Im thinking its because im playing it on a pal nes

<br />Doh! Oh well, good thing im making another one. Are there any other glitches other than that? The version im using had "not for sale" and "not for use in nesticle" right at the start.
