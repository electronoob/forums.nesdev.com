		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have quite a few devices that only have a parallel port. First and foremost my Super Wildcard DX2. Needless to say my macbook does not come with a parallel port ;-] There might be some usb&lt;-&gt;parallel-port-printer adapters but those most certainly will be completely useless for the bit banging required by the copier protocol. <br /><br />Are there any other ways anyone could think of ? Maybe some small microcontroller devboard with a USB port to connect to the PC and a parallel port to connect to SWC/whatever ? Is that feasible ? I can't be the only one who would like to resurrect some parallel-port only devices ?

Laptops, on the other hand...<br /><br />A microcontroller project is ambitious, because it will probably involve completely reimplementing the host-side software, or reverse engineering the original host software and splicing out the entire original communications protocol. Of course, if the host software is open source, that makes this task a lot easier.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The SWC DX2 supports hard disks, ZIP drives, and CDROMs through some particular manner (IDE, so I'm guessing IDE to LPT?) which I can't remember.  I have a working SWC DX2 as well, BTW, but I don't use Macs.<br /><br />You're correct about the USB-LPT adapters existing but causing complexities when it comes to the nature of some transfer software.  I wrote a SWC DX transfer program many years ago in Pascal + assembly for DOS on x86; it wasn't that complicated.  Most of the time is spent polling the LPT status port in a loop saying &quot;are you ready?&quot;<br /><br />The LPT communication protocol for the SWC series is documented here (&quot;PARALLEL I/O PROTOCOL&quot;): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/txt/swcteche.txt">http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/txt/swcteche.txt</a><!-- m --><br /><br />To be honest the most complicated part was getting support for 24 and 32mbit working.  I wasn't able to accomplish this until one day a colleague of mine (Royce from Damaged Cybernetics) told me to bitwise AND the raw data bytes with some special value -- and it worked.  I still to this day have no clue how/why.  And the uCON64 source is kind of an uncommented dump of a mess... :-)<br /><br />All in all, it's probably more effective to just find a flash cart for the SNES/SFC that uses CF or SD cards, and sell your DX2 on eBay or something (if you want to part with it, else keep it for nostalgia).

As a matter of fact I do have a SD2SNES and a quickdev16 but neither are as convenient as the swc used to be. It has decent transfer speeds and I could upload/patch ROM at runtime, reset to the SWC menu through the parallel port etc.<br /><br />Still I don't really fancy the idea of an extra PC just for the parallel port transfers. My house is to crowded as it is. That is unless I find something super small ;-]

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Old business laptops are pretty easy to find cheaply or even free, if you know anyone in corporate IT they probably have a closet full of them. I keep a Thinkpad T42 around just for DOS games and using a parallel port programmer. Doesn't take up too much space when I'm not using it and it runs the Windows 98 only software fine. I think the T43 is the last model with a hardware parallel port though.
