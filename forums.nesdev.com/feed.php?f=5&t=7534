I bet more than one person on here has had the same thought as me, but decided not to ask the question.<br /><br />I asked it due to the sterling reputation of the forums as a whole (aside from the obvious) and thought I could get my answer as a pre-cursor to finding out exactly about NesDev as a subject matter, and from what I've read, will still be an active member and try to contribute and try out the stuff thats on here.<br /><br />Someone mentioned EEPROMs n stuff, is it legal to copy your own rom if you own it? Isnt that worse than the box art?<br /><br />And when I said thank this time, I genuinely meant it guys, thanks, those answers helped, especially the DS one... I have a local blockbuster and I know a couple guys there, so i might get lucky (with the boxes, not the guys)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4727">duke2k7</a> — Thu Mar 03, 2011 4:07 pm</p><hr />

Guys, keep the replies helpful please.  Sure it is copyright infringement to reprint artwork, but if the one doing the printing has the original game, I don't see a problem with it (obviously not for reselling purposes, as the original poster already addressed).  It's just replacing a part of it that was presumably thrown away.  Hopefully it would be noted that it's a reproduction for collectors to know, but that's up to whoever does it.<br /><br />Seems sort of like having a cartridge where the EPROM dies, I wouldn't want anyone calling me a pirate if I desoldered it and burned it onto a new chip.  If you've got the cartridge, whoever originally made the artwork should have already been paid.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Mar 02, 2011 6:13 pm</p><hr />

Sounds like the exact opposite?<br /><br />Glad I know the truth. I don't appreciate the inference to be honest, I have simply amassed a huge amount of boxless games and I want them to be safer and more colourful on the shelf. I suppose to that same end the company who make the universal game cases are supporting piracy?<br /><br />Nice openminded view. I simply wanted advice on how to make my personal collection look more complete, I have no interest in selling them, not that I have to justify myself to anyone, let alone someone on a forum.<br /><br />Nintendo have already emailed me back about non-availability of back catalogue boxes so I had to investigate other options.<br /><br />Thankfully I joined another more helpful forum, where people read threads for what they are and not to splash pirate labels on them.<br /><br />Such a pity my first post got your attention.<br /><br />Mods, you can happily delete my membership if you would like as this obviously isn't the place for advice for self-confessed newbies like me, or should I say complete pirate according to 'others' on this forum.<br /><br />Jesus, what a waste of a registration, just cos u obviously feel better than someone who hasn't got the boxes to certain games whereas you have just brings u over as an unhelpful ass. Period.<br /><br /><br />And I was told there were helpful people on here.. You hadn't replied to theirs had you?<br /><br />Oh, thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4727">duke2k7</a> — Wed Mar 02, 2011 1:29 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm not a pirate, I'm a collector<br /></div><br />Sorry but to me it sounds the exact opposite. Making fake boxes would enter in the domain of copyright infringement and bootlegging. It will also hurts honest collectors, especially if you sell this back with a box as a real one.<br />A boxed game with a box in good condition can easily fetch 3 or 4 time the price of the loose game.<br /><br />However I agree it's horrible how many people sell used games loose because they just were stupid enough to throw the box away, but hell, buying a lot of used games I just had to get used to that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Mar 02, 2011 12:33 pm</p><hr />

Hi Guys,<br /><br />Hoping you can help.<br /><br />I have a number of Super NES / Super Famicom / Gameboy Original and Gameboy Advance games that I do not have boxes for, and I was wondering if anyone knew of a repository where I can print them on card?<br /><br />I know of the coverart project, but they only have sleeves for the Universal Game Case, I was looking to print them at home to complete my collection.<br /><br />I've looked but every search string comes to a dead end.<br /><br />Any ideas? Please don't flame for asking the question, I'm not a pirate, I'm a collector. Please don't flame me cos I'm new. If I have put this in the wrong section I apologise, but don't lame me to that either, as I genuinely appreciate any help that you can give me, as this site has provided me with loads of information prior to me registering.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /><br /><strong>[Subject Fairy was here --MOD]</strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4727">duke2k7</a> — Wed Mar 02, 2011 8:17 am</p><hr />
