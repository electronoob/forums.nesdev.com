To leave this in you need to supply a debugging build for people who want to use it OR change the #define to make a branch that slows down your emulation code even for people that don't care about debugging.<br /><br />This is just a simple example, but it's really easy to make very minimal but unusuable-to-others debugging tools for yourself when programming. Even though you need -something- that doesn't mean that something would be worthwhile to leave in for others. There's a huge amount of effort between a printf trace, or dumping binary logs, or saving a BMP of your nametable, and something like FCEUX's debugger.<br /><br />I've seen a few emulators that have a good debugger but require you to use a debug build (which is provided alongisde). I don't make the assumption that all emulators have worthwhile debugging tools in them that the users are just hiding from you for no reason. If someone bothers to make a good debugging tool, it's likely they have pride in it and will share it. If their emulator doesn't seem to have debug tools it's probably just because there is nothing worth showing.<br /><br />Actually, here's a question, does Nestopia have a debugger hiding in its code that you can enable by building it yourself?

I'm using something similar to that with a game I'm developing: it can write rendered frames as raw RGB24 to an output pipe, and the player can record a playthrough by piping that into FFmpeg. Likewise I seem to remember VisualBoyAdvance connecting to debuggers through GDB's protocol. Let the people who know emulation handle emulation, and let the people who know UI handle UI.

If debugging is handled by an external process, maintaining the interface to that process is theoretically less work for the emulator developer even if the UI developer has work to do.</div><br /><br />I've had experience with both models.  They both have problems.  <br /><br />NESICIDE is &quot;integrated&quot;, for example, with VICE's remote monitor to support debug step capability of C=64 programs running in VICE.  It works OK but I'm only in charge of my side of the interface.  I have to either a)live with the &quot;human debugger friendly, non-human debugger [my IDE], not so much&quot; problems with the interface, or b)join up with the VICE team to try to push my agenda.  I tried that and Spiro Trikaliotis was more than willing to help but then had to leave the community for some personal reason.<br /><br />And then there's my NES debuggers in NESICIDE.  I was pleasantly surprised that someone like Bananmos endorsed NESICIDE in a few recent thread posts.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  But in that model I face the challenge of a)not having as capable and optimized an emulator as other emulators, and b)not having that large of an audience that is interested in using something other than FCEUX or Nintendulator DX.  Not to mention that even though it's supposed to be buildable in Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX, I only have Windows readily available for testing.<br /><br />Oh...and an interface between an emulator and a debugger adds latency and processing time.  The VICE remote monitor port, for example, requires a UDP socket...to localhost...and is ASCII.

I find that very surprising. I guess I can see if people don't like their SAV files cluttering their ROM folder, but just sort by file type if you want to separate them.

Though I sometimes use it for that reason, especially with games where you can't save at all. I actually do use save states for debugging purposes. Rather than trying to recreate a certain set of circumstances over and over again when testing something, it's nice to just click &quot;Load State&quot; to get back to that point. Sometimes I need to test something a ton of times even using save states; it'd be a pain in the ass to have to get back to that point manually each time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">thefox wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">File -&gt; Auto-Run.<br /></div><br /><br />LOL

The thing that annoyed me was that I used to run the emulator (with pad unplugged) without needing any input, and the next time I plugged the pad the emulator had forgot the buttons. I think the problem with this particular emulator was that when it was initializing the button mappins, it'd look and clear the buttons if it didn't find the controller. I'd have preferred if it kept the mappings but showed that they were inactive. But now I can't even remember which emulator it was, so whatever.
