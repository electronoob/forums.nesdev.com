When a game fades to black (during scene changes), it typically does so by repeatedly subtracting $10 from each value in the color palette, setting the color to $0F when the subtraction goes negative.  If one of the colors is $2D, for example, that color would go $2D -&gt; $1D -&gt; $0D -&gt; $0F with this fading algorithm.<br /><br />Color $1D is not distinguishable from $xE / $xF with color emphasis off.  This has been confirmed.  With emphasis on, it is slightly darker, but I don't think it's enough to cause sync issues.  Colors $2D and $3D are unique AFAIK.  Nestopia's NTSC filter should show these colors as they really are.<br /><br />As I said before, I did once have an old TV that didn't like the Game Genie code entry screen.  That TV is no longer in my household, and the one I currently use with the NES has no problems with GG.  I suspect that very few TVs will have problems with color $0D, but such TVs definitely exist, so I'd stay away from $0D at all costs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Tue Aug 21, 2007 8:57 am</p><hr />

Even if they do hit the $0d voltage, I don't think it may be long enough to cause glitching on TVs; the $01-$0c colors don't seem to access the $0d voltage long enough to cause glitching.  Or are you saying that games would fade those colors to $0d?  In that case, those games could simply redirect the $xd to $0f or some other safe black when they are fading.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Tue Aug 21, 2007 8:20 am</p><hr />

That's why some games did this without too much problem.<br />Anyway, as already mentioned a hundred of times, no new game should use that color (nor $1d, $2d and $3d wich are pretty close to other exising colors anyways) no matter what (because they will fade to $0d).<br />I was told that $1d = $0f, $2d = $00 and $3d=$10 by someone some time ago, but I haven't verified on a NTSC TV, since I have none. I don't know how those colors look on a PAL screen neither.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Aug 21, 2007 1:23 am</p><hr />

I was wondering about the blacks in the NES:<ul>In NTSC PPUs, is $1d supposed to be the same as xE/xF?  According to the PPU voltage threads in this board, $1d is the same as xE/xF (black level) when color emphasis is off.  Some palettes including Nestopia's contradict this, where $1d and $3e are very dark grays brighter than xE/xF and $0D.  Does that mean they inaccurate, or do these colors vary with NTSC NES models or TVs? <br /><br />From kevtris's PPU Voltage thread, when color deemphasis is on, $1D gets darker.  It also says that xE/xF are always the black level, regardless of emphasis settings.  Does this mean that $1d is going to be darker than xE/xF when emphasis is on?<br /><br />Besides the Game Genie, has anyone here ever see TVs glitching because of other games that use color $0D?  Maniac Mansion (the American version, not the Japanese version), Skate or Die 2, and The Immortal use this color, so maybe those owning a PowerPak could test these games on their TVs, especially if those TVs glitch for Game Genie.</ul><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3329">strangenesfreak</a> — Mon Aug 20, 2007 2:51 pm</p><hr />
