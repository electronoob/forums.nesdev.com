The fact that it's the same opponent is only true because we know that story-wise it's supposed to be one and the same character. But from a gameplay point of view, this is the same as a game where there are multiple opponents of the same kind that periodically appear. Like those flying bugs that come out of a crater in &quot;Metroid&quot; where the game logic dictates that there won't be another one until the current one is out of screen.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBa0Ye74Z10" class="postlink">Nuts and Milk</a> perhaps?

Thanks.<br />By the way, you should really have a look at the specific video that you linked. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Snoopy's Magic Show: for the first half of the game, the only opponent is a ball that bounces around the stage, while you're collecting all 4 tokens to advance to the next stage. (In the second half, you replay all the stages again, but with Spike chasing you around in addition to the bouncing ball(s))<br /><br />Having only one opponent whose goal is to stop you from completing your task (something other than directly defeating the opponent) seems to be a concept that fits puzzle/strategy games, since these are the only kinds of games I can think of where this happens.<br /><br />Another hypothetical example may be some kind of racing game where your goal is simply to get to the finish line (with a quick time, but ultimately no time limit), but each course is a scripted stage where you have a single opponent (who doesn't play fair) trying to get in the way by setting up traps and harassing you instead of trying to outrace you.<br /><br />EDIT: I'M CLOSING MY BROWSER BEFORE I EDIT MY POST A 1001st TIME.
