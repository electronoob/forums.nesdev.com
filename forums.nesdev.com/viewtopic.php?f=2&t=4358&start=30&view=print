<br />Does the second write to $2006 reset bit 2 of YScroll ?
<br />
<br />If you can made a version of it using mapper 0 or 3 and with PAL timing I can test it for you, else I can't.
<br />
<br />PS : I've tried your method (with a XScroll of zero) and it works, but the first scanline is garbage, so you have to disable BG on it. But yeah it reduce the gap from 4 pixels to 1 pixel which is better.
<br />Also I've gotten weird glitches randomly, probably because of a bad connexion on the CHR side ? I've also gotten pink BG color sometimes.

Becuase of this you can actually write the high part of one and the low part of the other. E.g. write to 2006 once, and the write to 2005 right after is a write to the yscroll value. Then by writing 2005 to get x scroll, then 2006 to set the low part of the y address This way, I can prevent the 2006 write from overwriting bit 2 of the fine y scroll. <br /><br />I'm going to post this code to the nesdev site about this, but this seems to allow me to be able to do 8 way scrolling with a top bar without the bar/timed code to emulate the effect of bit 2. But I have no clue if it works on an actual NES.</div>
<br />This is what Tokumaru was talking about in the beginning of this thread.  Might want to go back and reread it, now that it's "clicked" <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Here's a few demos that use this technique..

<br />
<br />I _think_ the first write to 2006 resets bit 2 of y scroll, then the second write to 2005 sets it to the desired value.  The second write to 2006 is what updates the actual ppu address register.  The end of vblank is the other thing that updates the register from what I've read.
<br />
<br />I'll send you an example in a couple days once I have a chance to move more code out of vblank.  I'd need MMC3 and I think thats mapper 4?
<br />
<br />Seems like for PAL there is less time in VBLANK so I'll need to make sure my MMC interrupts get setup within the vblank sooner.  And there seems to be that accidental clocking of the scanline register with ppu writes, so I'll try and do all my ppu updates inside the vblank before setting the MMC interrupt
<br />
<br />This is a really interesting platform to work with.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I currently have no devcart for MMC3 (mapper 4), and for PAL there is more time in VBLank. In fact PAL VBlank is 105/32 (~3.28) times greater than NTSC VBlank (in CPU cycles), which is very significant).
<br />However, the PAL frame is 15/16 shorter (in CPU cycles) than the NTSC frame.
<br />Under most case, if you design your VBlank code so that it works on NTSC, it will work on PAL too. For raster effects, if you do calculation between each raster updates (which is a complex thing to do, but I've done it a couple of times like on my mode7 demo), you'll have to manage them so that they work on PAL first, and they can be portede to NTSC by adding a very small delay each scanline.
<br />
<br />If your code does work on Nintendulator and Nestopia it's almost certain it will work the same way on real hardware and if it's not it is certainly for a very stupid fixable detail.
