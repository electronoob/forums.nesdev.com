		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If I had to rate the various official NES and Famicom variants by picture quality without any modifications, I would rate the systems as follows :<br /><br />1  Famicom Titler - Supports S-Video, but uses RGB 2C03/2C05 CPU, leading to some incompatibilities.<br />2.  Famicom AV - Supports Composite Video output, no jailbars can be seen<br />3.  NES Front Loader, probably the Sharp NES/Famicom TVs, maybe the Twin Famicom - minor jailbars can be seen occasionally, if you know what to look for.<br />4.  NES Top Loader and probably original Famicom - RF only, prominent jailbars.<br /><br />Can anyone shed more light on the Japanese consoles (except for the Famicom AV)?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />One downside here is that the comparison of a top loader or original Famicom is affected by the RF output.  A basic AV mod will show prominent jailbars, but judging by the NES and the Twin Famicom, if Nintendo wanted AV output in these RF-only systems, it would have used a less noisy video path.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The strength of the jailbars seems to vary somewhat randomly from machine to machine, so far as I've seen with Famicom AV mods anyway. I don't know if a jailbar comparison is fair unless you're comparing several of each type.

There's already a Japanese website where a guy went to town redoing the A/V path on his Famicom to clean it up and got amazing results (I can dig up the links, but I've posted in threads here about them before).

The obvious stuff like the port differences aside, the chips are the same and their layout appears to be virtually the same.

The Square Button Famicom, which uses the HVC-CPU board up to and including revision 06.  The early boards formed the recall and tend not to be the most reliable.  They have the AV board connected to the main board via a ribbon cable.  The red bottom of the case has a glossy finish.  <br /><br />2.  The Round Button Famicom HVC, these have the HVC-CPU 05-08 revisions, and have the AV board connected to the main board via a ribbon cable.  The red bottom of the case usually has a matte finish.  There is overlap between the square and round button famicoms when it comes to the HVC-CPU-05 and 06 revisions.<br /><br />3. The Round Button Famicom GPM, these have the HVC-GPM boards, tend to be more reliable and have the AV board soldered to the main board via the shield.  They always have a matte finish to the bottom shell.  Apparently these will show less noticeable jailbars than the HVC boards after modding : <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://jpx72.detailne.sk/modd_files/fc/avmod.htm">http://jpx72.detailne.sk/modd_files/fc/avmod.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />4.  The Famicom AV<br /><br />Game-Tech has some pictures and a video of a Nintendo-fixed RF output NES Top Loader, as you can see, the internals are almost identical to a Famicom AV (but apparently still accepts AC input.)  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.game-tech.us/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Nes/NES-101Intro">http://www.game-tech.us/pmwiki/pmwiki.p ...

It's backplane refers to the power jack as DC IN where other Top Loaders say AC ADAPTER, but it has a bridge rectifier on it, so I believe it uses the standard NES-002 brick.
