It'll usually look ugly when you tile it, so go through and tweak it until it looks more uniform. From there, you can go straight to the shading, or you can expand your blobs so they touch, tweaking the shape where necessary, and add the shading to that. To convey the idea of rocks, keep your edges angular, rather than circular. A little rounding is ok, because rocks get weathered in real life which smoothes them out a bit.</div><br />Another excellent explanation; thank you very much. Have you considered writing a tutorial (or have you written one already)?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Marscaleb wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think the problem is that all you have that isn't something the player can touch are those two bushes.  If you had more background elements it could work a lot better.  If you had more foliage in the background, maybe some little houses or something...  Altogether if there was more background then it would work well to use the black outlines only on player-collidable objects.</div><br />I want to add more background elements - <em>many</em> more background elements - but I'm having a hard time learning to draw them all. Hopefully the bushes won't be so out-of-place when I have trees, mountains and buildings all over the place.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Marscaleb wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Mario 3 uses a couple things.<br />[...]</div><br />So visually I was on the right track: simple blocky shapes are interactive, complex curvy shapes are in the background. That's still not quite perfect though; look at the airships. It's a lot more complex than &quot;black outline means solid&quot;. I think the player can be trusted to infer that my two bushes are purely decorative, provided they're introduced in the right way.<br /><br />As far as teaching the player through gameplay goes, I read an entire essay on the design of the first two levels of SMB3 alone. They covered pretty much the same things you just did, plus stuff like animation cues and the sound the P-meter makes. If only modern games were so subtle...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm used to having more colors to work with to where the dark sides of the rocks could be a different color than the gaps in between.</div><br />I could arrange for a three-shade palette. I was hoping to try some sprite-based parallax tricks, which would require the sky as the background color, but that might be a bit much for a first try. And I could change the background color anyway if the two areas didn't share tiles to begin with, which might actually be practical for a cave tileset.

But if one tile uses the background color as the sky and another uses it for black, they can't appear together. EIther the three-shade rock palette must only appear in areas with no sky, or a seperate set of sky tiles must be created, which could be numerous if rounded corners and slopes are involved. If I want to fit in NROM, I need to recycle tiles, doubly so if I want to budget extra tiles for extra-nice rocks. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So how I'm imagining it is that there's a body of water between the waterfall and the foreground? (and you could possibly draw water in front of the foreground)</div><br />Yes. The gameplay layer is in and over a body of water, be it a lake, river or the sea, into which the waterfall flows. There are rock platforms jutting out of the water or 'hanging' off the background, and possibly wooden bridges between them.<br /><br />I'll see if I can post a mockup of the layout in another day or two, with flat gray for rocks if need be.

Have you considered writing a tutorial (or have you written one already)?</div><br />You're welcome. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I haven't written any tutorials because I'm not a professional and usually just figure stuff out as I go. Pixel art is almost identical to traditional art, and lots of techniques from there (such as painting, perspective, lighting, composition, palette selection) carry over to pixel art. When starting out, pixel art is often treated like sketching stuff on paper with a pencil, and then coloring it in with a marker later, and although that's a good technique, it's not the <em>only</em> technique available to you. The rock example is actually more like a painterly way to do rocks, rather than a sketch-and-color way.<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div>For another example, this tree was done similarly to the rocks, it started with a tree-shaped blob of the darkest green color, and on top of that went the medium green, drawn like brush strokes with the center of the tree mostly filled in, and then the lightest green went last using the same brush stroke idea as the medium green. In between each step was pixel-tweaking to break up large regions of color, refine the shape of the branches, etc. Grass can be done the exact same way, just all the lines point upwards. This is just one of thousands of ways you can draw this.<br /><br />Pixel tweaking is really the only thing unique to pixel art which distinguishes it from more traditional art. All stardard art lessons apply to pixel art otherwise, including how to draw trees and rocks. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

	</div><br />It probably still takes up way too many tiles though. Just comparing it to Drag's, I have to say I think mine is to bright for a black background. I could always fix it up if you want to actually use it. As for trying to learn to draw, I don't know how you do it, you just kind of do it. I don't really have any method to my drawing, which could be why it takes forever.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just always feel like people seem to think there's some sort of formula to drawing. There may be, but I couldn't tell you it because I don't know it, or at least not consciously.<br /><br />The games I generally look at to try and get an idea of how to draw something from are usually Metal Slug. I'm not super enthusiastic about the &quot;cartoonier&quot; looking things in the game, but the other stuff looks awesome:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.sci-fi-o-rama.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/metal_slug_sub.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Of course, another good looking game is GunForce 2. It might not be quite as clean looking, but I like the art direction better (especially the sprites. I don't think a lot of the sprites in Metal Slug really match the background artistically, as they're much more ridiculous looking and have greater outlines. I don't know if this was done to make them stand out or what though.)<br /><br /><img src="http://www.arcade-museum.com/images/105/1058642626.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />One thing I really want to see though is an NES game that has highly varying backgrounds, (kind of more like a picture than what you'd expect from a tiled system) like Metal Slug. This isn't really suited for something like a platformer though that has a ton of levels.

And so far the results have been <a href="http://pixelation.org/index.php?topic=19899.msg172549#msg172549" class="postlink">stunning</a>. Since Castlevania had 16x16 attributes, it seems a lot of artists have been keeping black the dominant color to &quot;break the grid&quot;. The topic might be worth a read since you seem to like that aesthetic.

In fact, every tutorial on pixel art I've found so far assumes the reader is already an artist, which makes them more or less useless to me. The fact that you're not a professional is a good thing, in my book - you explain things in terms anyone can understand.<br /><br />Back on topic, my first attempt at rocks and waterfalls came out pretty awful.
