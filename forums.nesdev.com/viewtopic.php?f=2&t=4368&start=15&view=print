<br />
<br />The Stamper brothers founded Rare afaik, but I thought they weren't programming anymore by the time they released Battletoads.
<br />
<br />At least around 1994, Chris Sutherland seems to have been the main coder at Rare.
<br />Prior to that, I've no idea.

<br />This seems a good plan as I've asked my sister to be an artist for my games (by bro isn't a good artist nor a good technician). Unfortunately I haven't done enough programming yet and my sister is always too busy.

<br />
<br />are you ever not a total asinine jerk? have you even played battle toads and read the nintendo power comics for it?
<br />
<br />what are you, only 14? no wonder you have so many posts, you complain about everything.
<br />
<br />last i read that Battle Toads comic was in upwards of roughly fifteen years ago!

<br />Of course there's a difference. But as I understand what jargon is trying to say, the comic characters just look like and have the same name as the programmers, in the same way that the characters Jerry Seinfeld (<em>Seinfeld</em>) and Stephen Colbert (<em>The Colbert Report</em>) look just like the actors by the same names who play them.

<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hi Matthias,<br /><br /> <br /><br />From what I can gather, Chris Sutherland programmed the coin-op version of Battletoads while Mark Betteridge handled the NES version (my source beingâ€¦ Chris Sutherland).<br /><br /> <br /><br />Hope that helps!<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />I really enjoy chatting with game developers of the NES/SNES days and most I've talked to were very helpful and friendly, but I haven't had any luck with people from Rare in the past.
<br />They're usually very secretive about everything.
