		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys, well ive been so close to getting a rom split and ready for programming. the first game im making is super mario brothers 2 Japanese version, and i already download the mmc3 hack version and split the rom. Now all i have to do is data mirror it for programming, but i have no idea how to do it. If someone could please help that would be great. i know the CHR for mario 2 is only 16 KB and the eproms i have are 512 KB so i have to duplicate it a lot. i have the willems eprom programmer and im using the hex workshop 4.2 software. If anyone has any info please send me a PM, or better yet a instant message on AOL Instant Messenger. my username there is parpunk Thanks guys!
<br />-mark

<br />
<br />However, if the state of those address lines is unknown, you'd better replicate the data. I guess that a simple copy &amp; paste procedure could be done in the hex editor, give it a try. If that fails for some reason, try using a command prompt box (if you're using windows). The command "copy /b file.chr + file.chr file2.chr" will result in the file "file2.chr" holding the data from "file.chr" twice. Of course you can replicate it more times, like "copy /b file.chr + file.chr + file.chr + file.chr file4.chr", where "file4.chr" will have the content of "file.chr" replicated 4 times. Do that as many times as you need.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All the pins labeled "Axx" are address lines. These tell the chip what address to read from. However, the CHR data you have is much less than the size of the chip. By connecting the unused address lines to GND, you'll make it seem like your chip is only 16KB.
<br />
<br />Since 16KB is 16384 bytes, and 2^14 is 16384, that means only the first 14 address lines are needed to address the CHR data. So, A0 through A13 should be connected accordingly, but A14 to A18 should all go to GND. I don't know what chips you're using, so you'll have to check out it's pinout and see where exactly those address lines are.

<br />Do you happen to a know a chart that shows which pins would be the AXX on these. also to take the pins to the ground you mean take a wire from them to the GND? How many wires you think i will be running on those. please let me know man, im sooooo close. lol

<br />I guess it's because I said he didn't <strong>have</strong> to replicate the data. But I guess he decided to go with the replication, though.
<br />
<br />Although since he is converting a cart for EPROMs, he will have to rewire many of the higher address lines anyway, and would be easier to solder them all to GND than look for holes and all that, don't you think?
<br />
<br />But maybe since he's a beginner at this, maybe he should go with the standard procedure.
