		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been using yy-chr for quite some time now, and I've pretty much figured it all out, but I don't have any idea what that ADF file save/load is for under the palette menu. Am I missing some useful functionality for editting NES or is it just for some other system?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Think of an ADF file as an custom layout file, as it remaps the tile's layout for use in other games, lets say you are working on a SMB1 hack and want to rearrange tiles without harming the original 8x8 layout, You can make a new layout by editing it to conform to your arrangement standard<br /><br />Example:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">(00)(02)<br />(01)(03)<br /></div><br /><br />in 8x16 mode, from the default ADF file, turns into:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">(00)(01)<br />(02)(03)<br /></div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It took me a few days to try fiddling about with it to understand what you said. What I noticed is that what you said I already knew and used, it's the pattern arranger. What I didn't know is that the two features were related. You were talking about the pattern arranger in which you can choose default arrangements from and edit or create a new one.<br /><br />My question was regarding the ADF file save/load feature so I was puzzled by your answer. I had noticed the pattern arranger didn't work between sessions even though I &quot;saved&quot; my new pattern in the arranger popup. So I thought maybe that's what the adf file save/load feature did, and yes, that's what it does. Thanks for hinting me in the right direction!<br /><br />There is nothing indicating these features are related which is why I was confused. What does &quot;ADF&quot; stand for anyway?
