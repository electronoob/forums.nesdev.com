The band Napalm Death is a good example, I know the lyrics to some of their songs (often very thoughtful and well written, believe it or not) I find it distracting.  But the ones I can't hear or understand become more like background music.  Heavy and fast background music, heheh.<br /><br />I used to try listening to some talk radio (Art Bell) when coding, but that was distracting as hell.  I noticed that I would turn the radio off during commericals and actually code productively then.  So I pretty much quit listening to radio entirely.<br /><br />I normally can't listen to game music while coding.  Not NSFs anyways, it's too interactive, I'm always wanting to change tracks and stuff.  I'm not gonna bother with making my own playlists.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Aug 29, 2006 11:24 am</p><hr />

Maybe I just listen to songs so many times that they become background music to me eventually. Songs with less-prominent melodies could also be useful, like house music. Sometimes I listen to music while coding and I think it helps by influencing my mood, giving me enthusiasm and making me less prone to distraction. I hardly ever listen to music with vocals, since I usually find it really distracting unless the vocals are mindless.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Aug 28, 2006 8:43 pm</p><hr />

Clarification: By "carefully chosen" music, I was implying New Age music, specifically stuff by Enya (although IMO, Norah Jones and some of the more popular classical music would work too).

I'm surprised most guys have AC at home. This is an quite important waste of electricity, and it contribute to heat the planet more, even if it looks like it cools. I think using AC should be reserved for really important uses. Use it at home is a real waste.<br />I live more on less in the mountains, so it may be cooler here than anywhere else in the world. When it is about 34°C outside, I close all windows and shutters to keep the room at 26°C and I can live with it. If it goes really too hot during vacation or I go in the underground room where there is also a PC and the temperature here never surpasses 20°C, even if it is 34°C outiside.<br />I'm really not bothered by heat when I'm at home, I'm rather bothered by heat outside of my home.<br />My worst distraction ? Usually I just code in weekend or vacation days, during the afternoon or so. My worst distraction is my own wish to play various games and not-wish to work, I think.<br />About noise, I have no problems, exept maybe a jerk negitboor dog barking all the day.<br />Also there is always my mom and my dad telling me I'm too much on my PC, and always chosing the worst time to annoy me with that. After that, of course, the worst "distraction" is scool, that I'm fortunatly in vacation now, but it will start agin soon. I really DO hate scool.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Aug 25, 2006 1:47 am</p><hr />

Yeah, I have distractions, a lot of them. I have a very strange living situation... I live in a resort that my dad manages, and my mother, father, and I all work there. I will be coding, and then all of the sudden, my mom tells me that I need to go make beds, and do laundry, and it can be annoying to have to do those things in the middle of coding. I also have an air conditioning unit right behind my chair, and it blows freezing cold air right at me, and it's distracting. I usually think through coding alot before I do it, that way, I won't have to be sitting there thinking things through for a long time, and I won't have as many distractions. Making an RPG engine with many distractions is REALLY irritating sometimes... Especially when there are STUPID unexplainable errors in your code that cause random bad things to happen. It makes me want to melt.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Aug 24, 2006 7:57 pm</p><hr />
