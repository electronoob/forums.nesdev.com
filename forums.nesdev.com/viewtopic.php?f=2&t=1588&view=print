<br />Chinese:
<br />大家在这里只用英语或者日语（能写日语的地方在“FCDev”里边）。但是在这里可能有一些想学汉语的学生想跟中国游戏开发者聊天。麻烦你告诉我们，在哪里能用汉语聊天？(ie. 告诉我们一个好的汉语emulation论坛网址 － 你喜欢哪个论坛？) 谢谢
<br />
<br />English:
<br />Everyone here uses just English or Japanese (the place wherein you can write Japanese is "FCDev").  But there are probably a few students here who'd like to study Chinese and would like to talk with Chinese game (or  emulation) developers.  Please tell us, where can we speak Chinese? (ie. tell us the address of a good Chinese-language emulation forum -- Which forum do you like?) Thanks.
<br />
<br />(I figure if there's any further Chinese here, it's probably best to make it quick and use it to jump out to a Chinese-language forum for further discussion.  Personally, I'd like to find some good Chinese development forums as an interesting place to improve my Chinese.)

<br />Ah.  I'm there/here right now actually.  My phrasing was pretty lame because I wrote it in Chinese and then gave a reasonably faithful English translation from it.  There's chance to speak Chinese in the real world of course, but for me, that's generally not tech/development/hobby stuff.
<br />
<br />Memblers:
<br />Cool!  谢谢你 ;)  I wonder who will show up.

<br />Nothing against the people who know chinese, but I don't really know what to think about this...
<br />
<br />I mean, I can understand the japanese forum, since the NES originaly came from Japan, there are many japanese-only stuff related to the NES, and etc. But if if China gets it's own forum, I think so should other languages. For one, there seem to be a lot of spanish speakers around here. I speak portuguese, and I know there are at least other 2 or 3 brazillian people around (I don't know if that qualifies for a new forum though).
<br />
<br />I don't know the actual numbers of users from each country, but if there are many people using the same language, I think that justifies a new forum. Since other 2 different languages already have one, that is.
<br />
<br />Or does China get a forum because of the crazy ammount of pirate NES-related stuff they release?

However, on the other hand it might be a good idea to make everything english that way we can all read and post in the same language. If useful information starts to be posted in Spanish then non spanish speakers are going to be missing out.
<br />
<br />What I am saying is, english is a universal language that we all understand. Let's keep it that way. We all have computers that speak a universal language ((x86/C/C++) and look at the trouble that causes!). Imagine if every country in the world had a different computer format... *Shudders*

<br />That's no reason. Forums in different languages exist so that people that don't know/are not confortable with english can talk freely. That means that the important thing here is how well they understand english, not how much we understand them. And most foreigners understand enough english to find this place and at least read the posts, anyway.
<br />
<br />In fact, by creating forums for such different laguages you are doing what WedNESday said, dividing information in a way that not everyone can access it. With "similar" languages, everyone could get the idea of what's beeing talked about, as you said.
<br />
<br />I'm not against creating forums for any language (I studied japanese for a couple of years myself), but it is not right to create only for some, just because they use cool-looking asian characters or whatever reason, while there is a demand for other languages as well.
<br />
<br />I mean, people posted in spanish here before, but that did not result in the creation of a new forum, as this chinese post did.

I had pretty much effort to do so be able to speak english, and this is a universal language that almost everyone in the world knows the basics, and a lot of non-native english speakers learns advanced english. I think it is a good universal language, because basics are easy to learn, and when it comes to more complicated stuff it become quickly more confusing, but you can still talk with real english speakers and that will help you out a lot.
<br />English is an unniversal language, and this may not be changed, because I put pretty good effort to learn english. I'd not like to have a french message board for my own and have noone to speak with.
<br />By the way, I don't even know if I'd be able to speak about NESdev in french. I mean english is a perfect language for everything that have to do with computers, programming, electronics, math, etc... and for me french is for everything else. I have a lot of trouble speaking about computer-related stuff in french, since a lot of standard terms are in english and stupid people want to translate untranslatable stuff in french, making crap.
<br />As well italian is the perfect language for music, japanese is the perfect language for RPGs, etc, etc... I think this cannot be changed.

<br />
<br />(well, I'm both biased and not particularly concerned either way - so I'll leave this to you guys to decide.  In seriousness though, Chinese usage online, and the number of Chinese speakers involved in development is going up in a big way, and there seems to be an increasing interest in learning the language)
