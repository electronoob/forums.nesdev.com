Before you post on this BBS, please read this:<br /><br />We do not appreciate unsolicited advertising. Since 2010, in response to commercial vandalism by human spammers, some administrators have decided on various guidelines to determine whether or not users are likely acting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" class="postlink">in good faith</a>. I won't go into too much detail for fear of spilling the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don%27t_stuff_beans_up_your_nose" class="postlink">beans</a>, but here are some good ways to get your new account banned or deleted:<br /><ul><li>You register and don't post for several weeks, especially if you put a site selling something in the &quot;Website&quot; in your profile. Even though the member list and your user profile <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/robots.txt" class="postlink">aren't indexed in web search engines</a>, we still want to keep them clean. </li><li>Your first post doesn't appear related to the Nintendo Entertainment System. Some spammers have come to try to build a positive reputation by posting generic questions such as &quot;what PC firewall do you recommend?&quot; in General Stuff without making any attempt to connect their posts to the NES homebrew scene. Or they reply to someone's answer to someone else's question with a post saying nothing more than &quot;thank you&quot;. </li><li>In your first post, you make a link to a site selling something, especially if you try to hide it with [color=] tags. </li></ul><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> â€” Sat Aug 21, 2010 9:22 am</p><hr />
