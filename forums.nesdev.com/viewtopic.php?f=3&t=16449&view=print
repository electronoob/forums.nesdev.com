		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm having a tough time running nestest.  If I just load it and run, it reports all OK on both sets of tests.  However, if I force it to start at $C000 as the documentation indicates for automation - it crashes with an illegal opcode 0x32.  I tried running it in Nintendulator and forcing it to start at $C000 using the debugger and it spits out lots of errors, and eventually halts the cpu.  Has anyone else had that problem?<br /><br />Any advice on why running nestest from C000 doesn't seem to work on Nintendulator?  I also ran it on Nestopia with weird results.  It beeped once (I assume that's the success indicator) but didn't show anything on the screen (which is probably normal?).  However, it then hung and had to be force killed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you so much for the assistance.  To stop nestest when it's done I simply put a breakpoint at C66E which seems to work fine.  I am still seeing behavior that I can't understand - maybe I'm not using the test rom correctly?  <br />My emulator currently does not support opcode 0xE7 (ISB/ISC) and it will crash if it tries to execute one.  Not surprisingly, when I run nestest in automation (starting from 0xC000) my emulator crashes on opcode E7.  However, if I run nestest normally it runs fine and reports OK for everything.  Specifically I select &quot;Run all tests&quot; from the main screen and get all OK.  Then I press SELECT to get to the &quot;Invalid Ops!&quot; menu and again select &quot;Run all tests&quot; which tells me all those are OK.  It never executes an opcode E7 during either suite of tests.<br /><br />Am I missing something, or does nestest do a different set of tests when run from C000 than can be done manually?  If so, that is definitely not mentioned in it's documentation.
