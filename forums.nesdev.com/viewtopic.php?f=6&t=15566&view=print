		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi all; just hoping for some feedback on my music engine. It  - along with a Famitracker converter - is almost done to specifications I'm, I guess, happy with, but as I'm not a chip musician I don't really know if it's too constrictive.<br /><br />It's actually for the Game Boy, but since the NES has fairly similar sound hardware I figured I'd just post here for maximum exposure to the correct audience (feel free to move it if you'd like mods).<br /><br />Here's the basic specs:<br /><br /><ul><li>Each frame must have the same pattern on all channels.</li><li>Each &quot;row&quot; can have one or more global effect that's executed before the channels are updated, such as tempo, master volume, or flow control.</li><li>There's underlying support for per-channel effects, although the only one I have implemented now is octave up/down (which Famitracker doesn't seem to support, anyway?)</li><li>Instruments, but all five sequences (volume, arpeggio, pitch, hipitch, duty) must have the same length/loop point. release points aren't supported.</li></ul><br />If you were/are a musician, would you be able to work with this? Is there anything in particular that it's missing that you'd really want support for?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's simple LZ-style compression applied to the opcode stream while in ROM that should (hopefully) capture that, and the GB is fairly memory rich - the engine reserves an entire 4K bank for itself - so I suppose I'm not too worried about being space-inefficient. But then, I also suppose I don't know how large and complex a song might be <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br /><br />There's probably enough memory for 10 or so 64 row patterns when all's said and done. Is that enough?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My game has a save function, so we're going to need an SRAM chip anyway. I hopped onto Mouser, and assuming we wanted to make 1000 carts, it looks like we'd pay around 80 cents per for a roll of 1000 5v 256kbit chips. I can't find any smaller chips that are any cheaper.<br /><br />Which is getting ahead of things anyway, any sort of cart production is very pie-in-the-sky ATM.<br /><br />FWIW, I have no idea how it'll grow, but my core engine is, uh, maybe 40% done (?), and uses nowhere near 4KB on its own.<br /><br />At any rate, duly noted on song length. Even if I could I'd rather not use 8KB of RAM just for the sound engine, so I might have to change things.
