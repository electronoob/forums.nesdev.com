I'd rather have a CRC program than header addition, because it's pretty wasteful for the header to contain that garbage. I mean, aren't there more than 16 additional controllers? I'd bet. And that makes it basically 2 bytes, prefered and extra, unless you only go with one controller. Or have the 1 byte represent every combination ever used. But no matter what, having it in the header is a shitty idea.</div><br /><br />So, your worst case is 2 bytes? The current spec actually has 2 bytes of padding in the header, by the way... do you think 2 bytes of zero information is also wasteful? Having separate files wastes far more than 2 bytes just for the file record.<br /><br />1 byte is probably sufficient, though. I think there are far, far less than 256 useful controller setups. The wiki lists about 20 potential input devices, and most of them are really only used in one configuration; we don't need every permutation, just the ones that were used by games. If some new homebrew wants to use a novel configuration, it can be allocated a new index just like mappers are.<br /><br />I don't understand your objection to having this information included in the NES file. So what if it's not part of the cartridge? The NES zapper is a part of the game Duck Hunt just as much as the cartridge is. It's not playable without it. The famicom keyboard came in the package with Family Basic. The SNES mouse came packaged with Mario Paint. They're not the slightest bit inessential to emulating these games properly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />How would you handle games that can use more than one type of controller? SMB/DH needs a controller in port 2 for Luigi in SMB1 but a Zapper in port 2 for Duck Hunt. SMB/DH/WCTM needs even more setups. The first Action 53 multicart can use controller, controller+Zapper, Zapper+Zapper, controller+mouse, or (I think) mouse+mouse. Would an entry in a controller registry be needed for each combination?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I look at it similarly to how I would treat a PAL/NTSC flag. This flag tells you what configuration the cartridge is intended to be plugged into. It's a default setup, not necessarily a list of all things it could use. Unless overridden by the user, an .NES flagged as PAL should start up in PAL emulation mode. If the ROM supports both, the user will need to select the non-default option manually. (Would 3gengames suggest doing PAL detection by CRC too? It's certainly not part of the cartridge.)<br /><br />For all three cases you mentioned, the standard 2 controller setup (most likely identified by the number 0 in this scheme) is a perfectly appropriate default. If desired, one of the setup entries could be &quot;multi&quot;, which defaults to 2 controllers but is letting you know that this game has multiple peripheral configurations.<br /><br />A &quot;multi&quot; option most likely doesn't make it easier or harder for an emulator user, but it might help organize your ROMs with automated tools (e.g. display all zapper games).<br /><br />Back to the PAL flags, it looks like the current spec has: 0 NTSC, 1 PAL, 2 both but default NTSC, 3 both but default PAL. I think the lack of Dendy is a glaring omission, but ignoring that for the moment, this does cover all the non-Dendy use cases. NSF has the same two-bit field, more or less, and it led me to give the user 6 options in NSFPlay: 0 use default, 1 prefer NTSC for dual, 2 prefer PAL for dual, 3 force NTSC, 4 force PAL, 5 force Dendy.<br /><br />For peripheral setup, I don't think a bitfield would work very well. There'd be too many bits (at least 32?), and the number of useful combinations is very sparse (~30?). NSF made expansions a bitfield, and the homebrew music crowd made a horrendous and/or wonderful mess out of it-- this bitfield was probably a mistake (but a fun one). I think an indexed registry like we have with mappers would work well. Something like:<br /><br />0 - 2 controllers (generic, neither microphone or controller 2 start is essential)<br />1 - multi (2 controllers default)<br />2 - zapper in 2<br />3 - 2 controllers NES (start on controller 2 is essential)<br />4 - 2 controllers Famicom (microphone is essential)<br />5 - track and field pad<br />6 - family basic keyboard<br />7 - R.O.B. gyromite mode<br />8 - R.O.B. stack up mode<br />9 - power glove<br />10 - family basic keyboard<br />11 - miracle piano<br />etc... (a lot of these will be one-offs)<br /><br />Unlike mappers, it's also very optional. The user should normally be able to override the suggested setup, and a minimalist emulator author could ignore it entirely.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Even though it's not technically a part of the cartridge, if you ever used the CIC chip, or used any cart to PC hardware, you would need to know the clock, so it makes sense a PAL/NTSC flag is in the header, as the hardware is dependent on that. But also, you forgot the vaus+normal controller set up, my game can use all 4 combinations, and if I decide to add my mini game, my game will support 6 input configurations. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
