There is no special event that occurs when a length counter becomes zero; when it decrements from 1 to 0, that's all that happens. The associated waveform's volume unit though is always watching the length counter and whenever it's zero (no matter how it became that way), silence is output for that waveform. The reason I make this clarification is that talking of the channel being "silenced" when a length counter becomes zero then raises the question of "what unsilences it?" and points to the existence of some hidden "silenced" flag, which is why this way of putting it is misleading (there is no "silenced" flag). The length counter <em>is</em> the "silence" flag, if you want to think of one existing at all.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time when writing the APU reference (and the NesDevWiki pages based from it) to eliminate things like this. I preferred to describe things in a way that would leave no question of behavior, even if this meant that the reader would have to go slower or re-read things a few times. Fortunately this approach meant shorter descriptions, since they were describing things only one time and not giving easy-to-read-but-incomplete summaries. BTW, the reason for name of the linear counter is that you can load its value directly with any value, unlike the length counters which go through a table.<br /><br />When I first implemented an APU emulator, I ignored the length counters etc. and stuck with frequency and volume. Many games do their own volume envelopes in software so they sounded decent with this.<br /><br />Disch, perhaps we could rename the APU's frame counter the beat counter? Decay timer? Note timer? I'm all for better terms. I'd call the length counters duration counters, the frequency registers period registers, since raising the value lowers the frequency (unlike on the Game Boy, where they are frequency values).<br /><br />EDIT: improved sentence in first paragraph<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Fri Aug 11, 2006 2:08 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">n6 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />so the update should be called 4 times per frame for NTSC and 5 times if the other mode is selected in $4017.<br /></div><br /><br /><em>Roughly</em> 4 times per frame -- yes.  As far as I can tell the sequencer is driven by the CPU clock, so it will <em>not</em> work to an even number of times per frame.  4 Sequencer steps is either a little bit shorter or a little bit longer (I forget which) than the length of one PPU frame.<br /><br />In the 5-step mode... there are more steps before the sequence loops, however the steps are NOT any closer together -- so 5-step mode will slow the rate at which length/etc are clocked.  In this case... the full 5-step sequence is <em>considerably longer</em> than one PPU frame.<br /><br />So basically what I'm getting at -- is don't do ANYTHING on a per-frame basis.  A frame has nothing to do with APU operations.  The channels and sequencer are all driven by the CPU clock rate -- not the PPU framerate.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />But what is meant by reset, when writing to $4017? just that the step is set to 0<br /></div><br /><br />Yeah, it sets the step to step 0, and it also changes the number of cycles until the next step.  For details on how this works, pick up blargg's APU test ROMs.  The documentation included covers APU sequencer timing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How do I know if its Length or Linear that I should use?<br /></div><br /><br />When length is clocked (every other step in the 4-step sequence), you clock the lenght.  When Linear is clocked (every step in the sequence 4-step sequence) you clock the linear.<br /><br />Both counters operate independently of each other, and both can silence the channel... so if EITHER counter is 0, the channel is silent.  In order for the Tri to be playing anything, both linear and length counters must be nonzero.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Okey but I just count them down and when one of them reach zero I stop the channel<br /></div><br /><br />Yes.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />and reset the other to zero?<br /></div><br /><br />No.<br /><br /><br /><br />If I were you -- I wouldn't worry about the sequencer and subsystems yet -- and I'd just get sound playing.  Like make the squares just output tones without doing the decay/sweep/length units.  You can always add the sequencer later, and perhaps you might have a better idea of what to do after working with the main channel.<br /><br />The APU is a pretty big area, and trying to get in all in your first bite may be a bit rough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Fri Aug 11, 2006 11:02 am</p><hr />

On certain steps... certain parts of the APU (such as length, linear, decay, sweep, etc) get clocked.<br /><br />The Length unit for each channel gets clocked on two of the steps.  In the 4-step sequence, this means it will be clocked roughly 120 times every second.<br /><br />Your understanding of the length unit is correct though -- it simply counts down until it reaches 0, at which point it silences the channel.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I don't understand how to implement the linear counter for the triangle channel, infact I don't understand what it is.<br /></div><br /><br />The Linear Counter is more or less the same idea as the Length Counter -- except it provides a higher resolution and is clocked more often (roughly 240 times every second instead of 120).  When enabled, it too will simply count down until it hits 0, at which point the Tri will be silenced.<br /><br />Blargg's APU docs cover the details on it pretty well -- if it's still hazy, try rereading it a few times until it clicks.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />3.

All other "sub systems" of the channels:   Length, Linear, Sweep, Decay are driven by the sequencer.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Fri Aug 11, 2006 7:57 am</p><hr />
