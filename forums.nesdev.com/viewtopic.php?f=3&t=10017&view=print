		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been doing a bit of debugging on this one. It seems to use four-screen mode (not documented anywhere and the bit is currently not set in the INES header in the GoodNESs ROMset..). I've been trying to convert it from mapper 99 to mapper 1 (with four-screen set in the header). <br />However the issues starts here. Is there anything stopping a mapper1 game working with four-screen layout? I haven't tried my code on real hardware but emulators behave<br />really odd here (Latest FCEUX shows nothing in the Nametables-debug view, it's blank). Nintendulator doesn't seem to support four-screen properly either when the ROM is set to mapper 1 (no issues with mapper 99 however). Is the mirroring-settings in MMC1 conflict with the four-screen layout?<br />Can anyone shed some light on this?<br />Thanks.

If you converted the game to use mapper 4 (MMC3) you'd be able to use 4-screen.<br /><br />Whether or not 4-screen on MMC1 on <strong>actual hardware</strong> would work, I don't know -- hardware guys here can surely tell you if that's the case.  However it's safe to say no one would be able to play the game in any emulators.

If there was a scanline counter or something nobody would have touched it.

Don't underestimate how much it could have costed (or what else may have needed to be sacrificed in order to get it there).<br /><br />Really, if this wasn't a problem chances are they'd have made the status register overlap some of the write-only registers in the first place (much like how the TMS9918-based chips have a port as control port when writing and status port when reading).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This game <strong>almost</strong> will work correctly with hardwired vertical mirroring (horizontal arrangement). You'll need to patch it to use the nametable at $2400 instead of $2800 if so. Alternatively, if you use MMC1, you could flip the mirroring control register at the appropriate times.<br /><br />AFAICT, most Vs system games don't actually use all 4 KiB of nametable memory—they just treat as 2 screen mirroring, arranged however they want. Hogan's Alley apparently expects &quot;whenever they want&quot; too.
