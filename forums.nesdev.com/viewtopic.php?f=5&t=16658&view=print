		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The amount of memory this requires is a minuscule fraction of the amount of total memory available. I don't think modern 2d game programmers worry about such things much. At least, the ones being productive don't.<br /><br />There are probably dozens of ways to implement multijoint bosses, but the least surprising for me would be a scene graph for each limb and keyframe animation to move everything around. The hitboxes would be rotated with the limbs.<br /><br />I don't know if that answers your questions though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I really can't even think of a single modern 2D game with multijointed bosses. I thought that multijointed bosses were only ever a thing due to memory/VRAM bandwidth constraints. Admittedly, it often doesn't make a difference visually, particularly if the object is inorganic.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think the most common thing I've seen is &quot;skinning&quot; of a &quot;skeleton&quot;.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation" class="postlink">Wikipedia: Skeletal animation</a><br /><br />The skeleton being a tree of &quot;bones&quot;, each bone a transformation matrix that's a point and space as well as an orientation and scale. When you move/animate a bone, it moves all of its attached children bones along with it, it makes a tree hierarchy. Ultimately the animation is played back as interpolations between keyframes of various poses of the skeleton.<br /><br />On top of the bones, you have the &quot;skin&quot;. This is a 2D or 3D mesh, wherever every vertex is attached to one or more bones (e.g. a vertex in the forearm might be 90% elbow bone, 10% wrist) and will move along with those bones as they do. Physics systems often let you attach various physics shapes to bones, etc.<br /><br />If you want to have rigid parts (e.g. metal pieces of a machine), just attach the vertices to a single bone. If you want to work with &quot;sprites&quot;, you can use a lot of 4-vertex rectangles. If you want to do it without rotation, just don't rotate the bones, etc. If you don't have/want a modern GPU, meshes, etc. you can even just do sprite tiles attached to bones too. Whatever constraints you want to use to get the look/behaviour you like.<br /><br />All of this applies equally to 3D and 2D work. I've seen it in both all over the place. I could probably easily come up with 100 2D examples if I looked, but I'm not going to spend time on that. Instead I'll just link a video of one of my favourites: Odin Sphere. All of its characters, bosses and otherwise, are animated this way:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nj6H5TBmcI" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nj6H5TBmcI</a><br /><br />This video seems to have a good explanation of the whole concept:<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3Cr8Yx3GGA" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3Cr8Yx3GGA</a><br /><br /><br />Why is this &quot;modern&quot;? Well, you could have a hierarchy of bones in the past, but the main thing that's tricky on old hardware is just the rotation and scaling of bones. You need a good floating point unit to make that turnkey, though it's certainly possible to implement on old hardware too (especially if you can live without rotation/scaling).<br /><br /><br />As an alternative to pre-made animation, you can use physics to animate bones as well. E.g. if you had something with a long tail, you could make a physical model of a bunch of connected pieces, and attach the bones to those physics objects rather than the other way around. Either way works, actually sometimes the two approaches are blended, e.g. the &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUybTfD3XmI" class="postlink">inverse kinematics</a>&quot; technique of using a physics system to determine how a player's legs should be placed to stand on an uneven floor, blended with the animated upper body.
