Specifically, the image created by <a href="http://wanyo.deviantart.com/" class="postlink">Wanyo</a>:<br /><br /><div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://orig13.deviantart.net/0f38/f/2015/005/d/e/neshimi_by_wanyo-d8cq1aa.png" alt="Image" /></div><br /><br />Then I learned that it was a recreation of the modern game Shutshimi, appeared on PS Vita, Xbox One, PS4 and Steam platform. And I was watching videos of what it was.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiqkEyC4Uk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXiqkEyC4Uk</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Eager to recreate and pixel art Wanyo hand, I set to work and hand-behaved tiles clouds. Then scroll movement gave them and implement sprite zero to make the parallax effect. Days later I encourage recreate the sprites. For now only of Shutshimi and one of the enemies shaped squid. I also recreated the shot collision with the enemy.<br /><br />And this is the result of what has been achieved so far:<br /><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a305/diskover/Shutshimi%20NES%20alpha%201.0%20201606212202214_zpsr9l37kgm.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a305/diskover/Shutshimi%20NES%20alpha%201.0%20201606212202366_zpsavwn3nps.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Let's see if I encourage you to go ahead and formed a small demo.<br /><br />PS: With the SELECT button, you can change the shot.<br /><br />For now I leave you with this alpha:

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This looks really nice!<br /><br />I'd suggest some more parallax strips of clouds to make the effect work better. Depending on your mapper choice though, this may be a near impossibility.<br /><br />Also, I noticed that the bullets disappear before moving offscreen. I thought this would make the bullets miss enemies as they spawned, but then I noticed that the enemies spawn fully offscreen. This is probably because it's early but I'd want to change both things. Both for aesthetics and because enemies that spawn entirely onscreen can be very annoying. I'll admit this is a bigger problem for a run 'n' gun than a SHMUP, because a player in a horizontal SHMUP is not likely to occupy the far right side of the screen, but I do know that the instantly spawning heavy gunners in Contra annoyed Mike Matei considerably: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/OnB4Hm8b11w?t=3m58s">https://youtu.be/OnB4Hm8b11w?t=3m58s</a><!-- m -->.

He stayed there.<br /><br />Right now I'm trying to restructure my video game The Banketh and I'm also finishing a technical demo based on the video game Shadow of the Beast, also for NES.<br /><br />I have no intention at this time to continue this other project. In any case, I would announce it here.
