Only have to modify the attribute table and have a light and dark version of two palettes.<br /><br />Changed the colors so the darker palette showed better.  Not much room with grey/black/white when you end up with 2 blacks trying to make it darker.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You should use powers-of-2 for sizes of your PRG and CHR chips. Some emulators will have trouble interpreting how to map 24KB into a 32KB space, since a 24KB ROM chip doesn't exist (I seem to remember the PowerPak having some trouble with this). I know it may seem like a waste of space, but you have to keep in mind that a ROM file is essentially a copy of what an actual cart would contain, and the ROMs in actual carts always come in powers-of-2 sizes.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, and a small artistic advice - I know this is just a tech demo, but once you put actual graphics in you should consider making the background slightly misaligned from the foreground (vertically), otherwise it might just look like small blocks sliding over big ones, as opposed to 2 interdependently scrolling layers. Reducing the contrast of the background blocks might help too (the back outline sometimes appears to &quot;snap&quot; to the foreground when the layers are horizontally aligned).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But then you'd need an insane amount of tiles... With an 8-pixel wide pattern you need 8 versions of the pattern. If you're gonna make that pattern wavy, with say, 4 frames of animation, you'd need to apply the 4 frames to each of the 8 copies, for a total of 32 versions of the pattern (which doesn't sound so bad for such a small pattern, but just think about 16 and 32-pixel wide patterns). That way you could calculate what bank to switch in based on the current animation frame (which changes at a constant rate) and the position of the camera.<br /><br />There's a level in Metal Storm that has some vertical animation on the background patterns, but this animation is tied to the horizontal movement of the camera. When the camera moves right, the bars go up, when the camera moves left, the bars go down, if the camera doesn't move, the bars don't either. This makes no sense, and just looks silly. If the wavy effect worked like that (i.e. the water would only wave when the camera was moving) it would look just as silly.

On the other hand, to keep things consistent you'd have to apply the wavy animation to the foreground tiles as well, and since the amount of patterns you can update each frame with CHR-RAM is fairly limited, you'd have to keep the variety of underwater blocks fairly low. Another option would be to use the &quot;pool&quot; approach to representing water, where the foreground tiles are not considered to be submerged.

One design problem is you'd probably need to either have the full background use the same tile, or a background colored one, and use the left and right 1 pixel of the metatiles empty, so a 16x16 area would be 14x16, but it'd work.

Color 0 is tied together in all 4 attribute palettes resulting in only 3 unique colors each.  12 colors + black for the entire BG without resorting to palette swaps mid frame.<br /><br />I suppose with a more varied background with say clouds on the top and grass on the bottom, you could swap the 4 colors used by the BG &quot;layer&quot;.

Color 0 is tied together in all 4 attribute palettes resulting in only 3 unique colors each.  12 colors + black for the entire BG without resorting to palette swaps mid frame.</div><br />Yup, that's how it works. Color 0 is shared among all palettes. If it helps, you can think of color 0 as the background color, and each palette has 3 colors + transparency (transparent areas will show the background color). It doesn't have to be black though, the actual color can be anything.<br /><br />BTW, swapping palettes mid frame on the NES is pretty tricky... first because using $2006 and $2007 will screw up the scroll, which you'll have to reset when you're finished, second because a single HBlank is too little time to change even one color and fix the scroll, and third because when rendering is disabled and $2006 is pointing to the palette, the color it's pointing to <strong>gets rendered to the screen</strong>, causing &quot;rainbow&quot; effects. Because of these issues, not many games changed the palette mid screen, unless it was for a clearly separated area, like an status bar.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">exdeath wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">How to .bank more than 64k CHR ROM banks in NESASM?</div><br />Can't help you with NESASM, I hate it to death. =)

Editing name tiles with NESST one tile at a time for the whole screen is getting old.<br /><br />As for NESASM I just stopped giving .orgs.<br /><br />.org $0000 for first 8k CHR-ROM, after that just specify banks and tack on as many .incbins as you want. <br /><br />16 byte NES header<br />16k PRG-ROM mirrored at $8000-$BFFF and $C000-$FFFF<br />128k CHR-ROM 72k + 56k dummy space to pad to 128k; 4k initial BG, 4k initial sprite, and 32 frames of 2k pages with animation <br /><br />There is ALOT of wasted empty space and duplicate data in my 72k. I'm going to work on cleaning that up next and come up with a more pleasant tile set as soon as I find a convenient editor.  Then it's time to start playing with sprite 0 and hblank scrolls.<br /><br />Hmm why did I get into this.... hopefully to learn how the PPU works intimately and write my own in VHDL with user programmable palettes and RGB output; direct drop in replacement RGB PPU via FPGA?  Why hasn't this been done yet?  Plenty of people have implemented the entire NES in a FPGA already, but people are still robbing PC10 chips and getting screwy palettes for RGB.
