well, i like that analogy of the harpsichord and organ and how composers composed just for those, so they sound different on piano.  this reminds me of the nsf -&gt; midi program that gigo and hi made awhile back, if you take any simplistic song and convert it to MIDI, it sounds just fine, even better in many cases-- but if you convert a song that truly uses the NES's hardware (anything by tim follin or konami?), it will sound either really weird or awful.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=34">RushJet1</a> — Sat Dec 31, 2005 9:01 am</p><hr />

Computers with moving parts are located outside the room. Digital noise reduction, which works by recording typical noise, taking its Fourier transform, and then subtracting typical power from the recorded signal's Fourier transform, cleans up any remaining noise.<br /><br />Or you could just get cheap, have me shout "Bingo!" into an 8-bit Sound Blaster set to record at 11025 Hz, and then upsample by 3 and convert to DPCM. (Rate $0F is within 2% of three times the 11 kHz supported by old PC sound cards.) DPCM on the NES has about a -24 dB noise floor, and you can get that even in a low-end consumer environment by using a "gate", which in practice means just cutting off the near-silence before and after the interesting part of the sample.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Mon Nov 28, 2005 10:14 pm</p><hr />

Hehe, if you want the NES sound is to the moderen SPUs what the Harpsichord is to the piano, that's a fair compasraison. I think a piano can't replace an harpsichord, because it hasn't the exact same sound. However, I didn't have much chances to hear real baroque music on real harpsichords, because you can only hear it in concerts that will be very long and eventually become very boring, even it's interesting during the first 15 minutes, such music comes quickly boring.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Nov 28, 2005 9:43 am</p><hr />

Good music is as much a matter of taste as are good graphics, the tools can only get you so far.  Consider the sound programmer like a composer, a master of the notes but there are far more skilled players of the instrument.  The hardware is his orchestra, it only is as good as the music its playing.  Bad musicians can mangle the greatest compositions, second-rate composers can write music not worth a great musician's skill.  The orchestra may or may not sound better with higher quality instruments.  The best composers composed for what was on hand.  <br /><br />As an analogy, Baroque composers like Bach or Handel composed for pipe organs and harpsichords.  The piano as known by Classical composers like Schubert and Beethoven was still being developed.  Consquently, Bach and Handel's compositions generally sound better on the older instruments.  They also tailored their compositions to take maximum advantage of the musical qualities of the older instruments.  When played on a piano, generally because the older instruments are not available, they will sound different.  The organ was better suited to a particular type of style, church music, and the piano another style, concert recitals.    Musicians generally don't use one for the other.  The Baroque composers mainly composed for church and the aristocracy while the Classical composers often composed for the more bourgeois tastes of the opera house and the concert hall.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=58">Great Hierophant</a> — Sun Nov 27, 2005 7:26 pm</p><hr />

NES may not be "analog" per se, but it's still "virtual analog", meaning that it has the same capability as an analog synth. Pulse-width modulated oscillators, integrators (which turn a square into a triangle), and sample-and-hold noise generators are common analog circuits.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sun Nov 27, 2005 3:01 pm</p><hr />

I 100% agree with NewRisingSun. People writing reviews SHOULD make sure about what they're talking about before reviewing, else they have better to shut up. There IS good review on GameFaqs, but there is way too much bad ones.<br />And yeah, the fact that the NES produces analog sound instead of the digital sound usual to people cannot be compared to a storage format, as the MIDI is. MIDI is "supposed" to sound bad beacause the sound font playing it back will never sound like the original song, but it's a storage format where you actually store a melody and NOT a audio waveform, like in all the most popular music format. So yeah, people say that MIDI suck and that MP3 is cool, that the NES sound suck and the Playstation 2 sound is cool, and they don't even know what they're talking about.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Nov 27, 2005 11:26 am</p><hr />
