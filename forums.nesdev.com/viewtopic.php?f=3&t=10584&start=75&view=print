		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The hell.... I looked at some other emulators' sources, and you're right, but my emulator seems to just f*ck up when I try it. It's like &quot;nope, rejected&quot;. It even fails NESTest and NEStress when I implement it like this: <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">int tempResult = (byte) a.getVal() + (byte) currValue + p.getBit(FLAG_C); <br />if(tempResult &gt; 127 || tempResult &lt; -128) { <br />p.setBit(FLAG_V, 1); <br />} else { <br />p.setBit(FLAG_V, 0);<br />}<br /></div> <br /><br />and I did the same thing with SBC except with subtraction rather than addition. <br /><br />This doesn't work either (which is basically the same thing): <br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">boolean v = (((a.getVal() ^ currValue) &amp; 0x80) == 0)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;&amp; (((a.getVal() ^ res) &amp; 0x80) != 0);<br />p.setBit(FLAG_V, v ? 1 : 0);</div><br /><br />I think you're right though, I need to get to the bottom of this (debating the purchase of a Sherlock Holmes-style outfit). I'll figure out what's wrong with my emulator's interpretation of the overflow flag and I hope that will fix the issue. I'll post tomorrow if I make any progress. Thanks for the suggestion, I really hope it turns out to be the problem.<br /><br />PS: using (byte) in Java casts to a signed 8 bit value if you were having doubts, so it should have worked. Anyway, will still try fixing it tomorrow. Hope it progresses in some way or another.

If you really want to know however: HalfNES, LambNES (don't know if this one actually works, but was on Google Code so I thought I'd take a peek), Nintendulator and FCEUX (which, although kind of different, seemed to have the same effect as the pieces of code I just showed.<br /><br />PS: Every emulator I've ever tried which seemed to work (Nintendulator, Nestopia, FCEUX, HalfNES, Yanese, and I'm sure there are more which I forgot) pass NEStress and NESTest. By no means am I saying that those tests should be the standard, but they definitely show that the very basics of an emulator is functioning decently, and mine failing the tests should, most certainly, at least be worrisome.

You'll have to come up with a better reason to hate on C++. Meanwhile I'm happily using it on an 8-bit embedded processor with 8K of ROM, because it doesn't force me to use any feature unless I deem that feature worth its cost (assuming it even costs anything to use).

I think blargg's examples did explain this in their annotations.<br /><br />When the scope is closed with } any variables within that scope are to be cleaned up / destroyed at that point. For a complex C++ class with a destructor, yes this means the destructor should be called at that point. However, for a primitive type like int, its destruction could be lightweight or nonexistent (e.g. it could be stored in a register, or it could be reused by another scope later in the function; it's up to the compiler). Even for a C++ class, an inline destructor would give the compiler opportunity to streamline the activity at the } point.
