It does not affect the value in the counter. It does not &quot;trigger a reload&quot;. The reload value is loaded into the counter when the counter value reaches 0. So to do this, you need to write the desired value to $C000 and then write to $C001 to zero the counter value. This means the next time a scanline is detected it will see the counter is zero and will reload with the reload value. This will not trigger an IRQ because an IRQ is only generated if the value is 1 and being decreased to 0.

My emulator shared that same effect with FCEUX and Nestopia if I introduced the aforementioned hack.<br /><br />I did some logging to record the registers for which the menu screen accesses.  During VBlank, it writes to the IRQ latch register, setting the reload value to 88 and then it commits that by writing to the IRQ Reload register.  This establishes the first scroll break on scanline 88.<br /><br />On scanline 88, it writes to the IRQ latch register, setting the reload value to 64.  It's an attempt to setup the second scroll break, but it never calls the IRQ Reload register.  Consequentially, the second scroll break appears in the wrong position.<br /><br />It's possible that my timing is sufficiently off that the Reload register write does not get a chance to run.  But, it's not an issue with the mapper incorrectly handling the register calls since there is no record that Reload was called at all on scanline 88.<br /><br />When the IRQ counter hits 0, I assume it is supposed to automatically reset it to the reload value.  In this case, it gets 88 again before the 64 was set.  It could be a race condition like that.  But, why would the programmers take such a risk and not call the IRQ Reload register to commit the 64 value?

The team didn't have nearly as much time to polish it as it had for <em>Mega Man 2</em>. I also seem to remember reading (don't remember where) that the engine changes were reportedly more extensive than those between <em>Mega Man</em> and <em>Mega Man 2</em>, as <em>Mega Man 2</em> was reportedly one man's 20% project.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Using the FCEUX debugger, I stepped over the IRQ code.  It writes 64 to $C000 (the IRQ Latch register) on scanline 88, but it never writes to $C001 (the IRQ Reload register).  If $C000 does not automatically trigger a reload, how does this code work?<br /><br />Edit: I think I finally got this working.<br /><br />I reviewed the MMC3 bullet points here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://kevtris.org/mappers/mmc3/">http://kevtris.org/mappers/mmc3/</a><!-- m -->  Here are the key ones:<br /><br />1. Writing to C000h DOES NOT affect the IRQ counter.  When the IRQ counter expires and reloads, it will use the new value written.<br />2. Whenever the IRQ counter changes from a non-zero value to 00h, the IRQ flag will be set if it is enabled.<br />3. Writing to C001h will clear the IRQ counter, and it will be reloaded from C000h into the IRQ counter on the NEXT rising edge of A12. It will decrement from that point on subsequent A12 rising edges.<br />4. Once the IRQ counter reaches 00h, the NEXT rising edge of A12 will copy C000h's value into the counter.<br /><br />The Mega Man 3 menu screen relies on that fact that the IRQ handler runs when the counter transitions from 1 to 0, but the counter is only reset when A12 goes high on the subsequent scanline.

Performing an access with PA12 low followed by an access with PA12 high will cause a count, even if this access is through $2006 and $2007. The exception is that a quick high-low-high sequence will not cause a count, but accesses through $2006 and $2007 aren't quick.
