Perhaps it's an issue of whether or not the address lines are latched on M2 rising edge (don't know how ROM/RAM chips work, so I don't know if they see changes to the address lines in the middle of an access or not).
<br />
<br />EDIT - I guess the /CE line is the most important.  During a sprite DMA access, the PRG-ROM would be active for a brief moment at the start of a memory read, but when the address changes to point to internal RAM, the PRG /CE line would go high and thus halt the PRG-ROM from further activity.  If the FPGA in the PowerPak controls the PRG directly and doesn't allow PRG /CE to "pass through," this change may not be visible to the PRG chip and cause it to continue a memory access when it shouldn't be.

<br />PRG /CE is needed to known the state of A15 (without adding a wire to the bottom NES connector at least), so Powerpak definitely must watch PRG /CE to enable it's PRG SRAMs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I decided for the heck of it to take a peek at the boot ROM code in a hex editor to see how much I could figure out.  Three things stood out right away:
<br />
<br />1. You don't seem to ever initialize the stack pointer.  This wouldn't be important, except that you do appear to write something to $010D early on.  On power-up, the stack pointer is $FD, but on reset it is set to three less than what it was prior to reset (which could be anywhere in the stack page, which in turn may corrupt whatever variables you have in that memory range).
<br />
<br />2. I did not see any zero-age addressing modes in the code snippet I looked at.  (Not important, but you might want to check your assembler.)
<br />
<br />3. You didn't disable frame IRQ's in the boot ROM.  Frame IRQ's are enabled on power-up, so if you don't take care to shut them off, an IRQ will fire every 1/60th of a second or so.  You can disable frame IRQ's by writing $40 or $C0 to register $4017.  (There is at least one game out there that won't work if a frame IRQ is pending at the time it begins execution.)
<br />
<br />Sorry for being a snoop, bunnyboy.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, mine finally arrived today.  Nice piece of kit.  The manual makes for a nice touch.  It works 99% fine with my 512MB Maxell branded CF card.  (There was one time so far when the browser was showing directories but no files, a reset fixed that).
<br />
<br />As expected there were the reported gfx glitches so I proceeded to do the resistor fix.  I have 3 PAL frontloaders and two of them still exhibit the same glitches, but at a much reduced rate and more confined to the top of the screen but one works near perfectly, if it wernt for it's loose fitting cart slot.
