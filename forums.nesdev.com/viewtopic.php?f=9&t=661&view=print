		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been dreaming up a design for a flash cart, and I've come up with a few questions which might affect the cost or possibility of actually building it.
<br />
<br />My design currently has at its core a "magic box" which needs to be filled in with an actual component.  I have it handling all connections between the NES cart bus and the various onboard ROMs and RAMs.  If I added correctly, interfacing the cart bus with a 512KB PRG, 512KB CHR, and 8KB WRAM would require 119 (!!) I/O lines.
<br />
<br />On to the actual questions:
<br />
<br />1. Is there any kind of (cheap) programmable logic that loads its behavior from an external memory and has at least 119 I/O lines?
<br />
<br />Do I really need that many I/O lines?  Can I get away with multiplexing the buses somehow?  If I get a chip with that many pins, I'll have to learn how to solder surface-mount by hand, which I've heard can be a pain.
<br />
<br />2. Where can I find information on MMC/SD cards?  From my searching, it seems that SD cards should support the older (and more open) MMC standard, but I haven't been able to find any documentation on interfacing with an MMC card.
<br />
<br />3. Will I be able get my controller chip and the MMC/SD interface to work using only +5V and ground?
<br />
<br />4. Where online can I get a few custom boards made?  Is there any free PCB design software available?  How many layers might I need for all of those I/O lines?
<br />
<br />Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.  I have this vision for my flash cart, but I don't have the knowledge to build it yet.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />
<br />119 I/Os sounds like a lot, how'd you get that figure?  I know you can at least connect the PRG data bus all together, and I doubt the mapper logic would need to know every single address line (but I dunno what your design has in mind, heheh).
<br />
<br />With memory cards I think it would depend on what's in the particular SD card used, it's probably safe to say you'll need a 5V/3V transceiver.  But at least it's not many lines.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />kyuusaku: You forgot controlling C data bus, as is done in exgrafix, and the NES side of the chip (CPU and PPU buses).
<br />
<br />For an MMC3 or FME7 class mapper (8 KB PRG banks, 1 KB CHR banks, variable mirroring) without expansion audio, you'll need at least the following 25 pins on the NES side: <ul><li>GND, +5V (2 pins) </li><li>CPU D0-7, A13, A14, /CE, M2, R/W, /IRQ (14 pins) </li><li>PPU A10-13, /R, /W (6 pins) </li><li>CIRAM A10, /R, /CE (3 pins) </li></ul>Run the other pins (mostly lower address lines and PPU data lines) as well as the CPU data lines straight through to the chips.<br /><br />Then 19 pins on the parts side:<br /><ul><li>PRG ROM A13-A18, /CE (7 pins) </li><li>WRAM /CE, /WE (2 pins) </li><li>CHR ROM A10-A18, /CE (10 pins) </li></ul>
<br />That makes a total of 44, which is (coincidentally?) the same number of pins as <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/mmc3/" class="postlink">Kevin Horton's description of MMC3</a>. The MMC3 has one unused pin, which corresponds to CHR ROM A18 in this design.
<br />
<br />If you're using CHR address lines to make a scanline counter, you might want to deglitch them with a cap, as explained on KH's MMC3 page.

Also, there is only one PPU /RD signal connected both to the cart edge and to VRAM (which you refer to as CIRAM for whatever reason, even though the NES board labels it as VRAM). VRAM /CE generally gets wired straight to PPU /A13 so as to always enable the nametables for PPU $2000-$3FFF unless you wanted to support ROM nametables.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Then 19 pins on the parts side:<br /><ul><li>CHR ROM A10-A18, /CE (10 pins) </li></ul>That makes a total of 44, which is (coincidentally?) the same number of pins as <a href="http://www.tripoint.org/kevtris/mappers/mmc3/" class="postlink">Kevin Horton's description of MMC3</a>.

<br />True, but that doesn't mean a new mapper (which is what abonetochew is aiming for) couldn't have a "high bit register" for addressing all of a 512 KB CHR.

IMO MMC5 is over the top for a flashcart, it's silly to use a 3.3V 300K gate FPGA for a NES project that isn't an entire SOC design. It's also strange to me why anyone'd use flashrom at all with a dynamic FPGA &amp; memory card setup.

<br />You need some sort of ROM to bootstrap the NES in order to load a ROM from the memory card into PRG RAM and CHR RAM. Even the FDS has a BIOS.

If you're going to be loading one game at a time (all that's really practical for NES copying) why the hell use flash? If you're like me and flip through games every few minutes, you'll be spending a rediculous amount of time flashing games, at least a minute for PRG then another for CHR. Also why the hell use flashrom when a single RAM can be your PRG ROM and WRAM or CHR ROM and CHR RAM *and* VRAM?

<br />I'm *AM* talking about using a flash memory card for loading games. Of course I'm not opposed to using NAND flash for massive game image storage, I'm opposed to using NOR flash to temporarily store game images... It looks to me like I made that very clear.
<br />
<br />The bottom line: 
<br />
<br />Flash = really f-in slow, there's a learning curve, doesn't like to be rewritten, can't necessarily write a byte at a time (say you wanted to patch a game with a Game Genie code on your copier)
<br />RAM = really fast, no learning curve if you use SRAM, truely random access, RAM bits are designed to be toggled

<br />Problem is that using RAM to store a video game program will eat a lot more current than using NOR (kicks self) Oh wait, I'm not on Pocket Heaven where we get into arguments about RAM vs. NOR for use on a GBA because unless you're on a Game Axe or a Game Theory Admiral or something, you don't have to worry about battery life on the NES.
