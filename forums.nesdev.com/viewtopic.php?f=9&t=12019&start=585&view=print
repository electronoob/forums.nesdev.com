I know Kevtris really has his hands full right now, but I'd be very grateful if he can fix the bugs I've come across on the V3.01 update.<br /><br /><strong><em>List of minor bugs:</em></strong><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">FDS Metroid door opening sound effect is completely silent (in fact, all FDS expansion sound effects go temporarily silent while the door opens and also while it closes)</span><br />Duck Hunt (VS.) v1.61 Patched Home Edition freezes up with graphical glitches past the title screen on HDMI, doesn't work at all on analog output (however, it works just fine on V3.00 beta)<br />Duck Hunt (VS.) v2.1 Patched Home Edition works just fine on HDMI, but not on analog output (works just fine on V3.00 beta too)<br /><br /><strong><em>Other weird minor bugs I've noticed but have been fixed on V3.01:</em></strong><br />On V3.00 beta, SMB1 and SMB1+DH+T&amp;F don't work on analog output, but work on HDMI output. SMB1+DH works fine on both HDMI and analog output<br /><br /><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong> I wanted to add that I've been on V2.25 for well over a year now since I got the Hi-Def NES kit and stayed on it even long after the latest firmware updates came out. But I finally decided to take the trade off of having those minor bugs in exchange for the nice new color palettes along with better overall sounding audio that has more evenly mixed volume between the audio channels (props to Kevtris, I only wish these very minor bugs didn't come about from the major upgrades in the firmware). I've found that the bugs on V3.01 are actually worse than the ones on V3.00 beta.<br /><br />Aside from all that, props to Kevtris for working day and night on also finishing the Super NT in a small timeframe!

Using a capture card and stepping through frames, I can see the pattern is very consistent; the top three* game rows are offset exactly 1 game pixel to the left every other frame. I tested the following games on real carts (where applicable), and they all showed the same behavior.<br /><br />240p test suite (PowerPak)<br />The Legend of Zelda (need to clip Link into the HUD)<br />Mega Man 6<br />The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants<br />Tetris<br /><br />Conceptually, this should be easy to correct for if the behavior lines up with the PPU even/odd flag although I don't know if the missing pixels are recoverable. (Caveat: I don't program FPGAs or know much about the NES.) It would be nice if this was addressed.<br /><br />*The viewport also seems to be shifted down by one game pixel. In other words, the top row has a black line inserted, the next three rows are jittery, and the bottom row is missing except in 1080p 4x mode. It's nice that the bottom row is visible in that mode since it suggests the other modes can be fixed.</div><br /><br />I noticed this yesterday when testing out my Hi Def top loader. I saw it on:<br /><br />SMB3<br />T&amp;C Surf <br />WWF Wrestlemania <br /><br />It's definitely a rapid, 1-pixel horizontal shift of the top-most 3 rows of pixels. I swapped in two alternate sets of CPU/PPU (all Rev-G) and can confirm the same behavior occurred on them. <br /><br />When I attempted to reproduce on an untouched front-loader via composite/CRT I noticed those rows of the image were cut off by the bezel. <br /><br />Is this a known/common thing with the NES? I was surprised how hard it was to find this thread when searching for information on the problem.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just tried Battletoads (PowerPak), and it seems to have the same artifact during the professor cutscene at the start of the game. I can't tell if it's happening during normal gameplay though because the top rows are black. A menu toggle for this might be nice to have if the behavior isn't universal and difficult to detect, but it does seem to be the norm rather than the exception.<br /><br />I also use a different HDMI capture card these days, and the viewport still appears to be shifted down a bit, so that's probably not specific to my capture setup.<br /><br />Another problem I've noticed since is that the emphasis bits might not be handled correctly. In Zelda 1, if you use a bomb in a dark dungeon room, the room isn't supposed to light up, but it does on Hi-Def NES. (I hear NESRGB has the same problem.)<br /><br />Granted, all of these are pretty nit-picky, but they seem to be in the realm of fixable if kevtris decides he wants to revisit this project.

I think it should be fine using the EverDrive clone for Hi-Def NES updates. It's got failsafes to check if the firmware is loaded up properly from the cartridge before it updates, this happened to me once. Turned out that having my EverDrive N8 in the down position on my Front Loader's ZIF connector didn't connect properly, so the update automatically cancelled itself before writing anything to the FPGA. I tried again in the up position and it worked out fine.

You have to get an official EverDrive then, or get a PowerPak from retrousb.com.
