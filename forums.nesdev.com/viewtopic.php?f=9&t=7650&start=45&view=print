<br />
<br />And that sounds great, I like to see a homebrew mapper being made now. I can't wait! What mapper number will you pick?

<br />
<br />I get your meaning. I won't be offended if no one uses this thing. My main focuses are to give people new to the platform an inexpensive and well-documented development process from emulator to silicon, and to create an option for current developers so they do not have to put up with sprite 0 hit-detection and 16 KB bank-swapping.
<br />
<br />@3gengames:
<br />
<br />I have looked into using 32K CHR-RAM. I am going to stick with zero CHR bank switching for the initial design until I get it fitted to a CPLD. Once that is complete I will see how many cells I have left over and see what can be implemented with them. Banking is very expensive on a CPLD though due to using many registers for each bank to remember what chunk of RAM / ROM needs to be loaded.
<br />
<br />As this is a strict sub-set of MMC5 I have advised to use iNES Mapper 5 on your ROM images. A detailed implementation document will be provided. More on this in the (upcoming) planning thread.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That would reduce the register count, and that is basically what SMB3 did <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I will keep that in mind.
<br />
<br />A major factor in how many cells we have to work with is the price of the chip. Depending on where the split is the price difference may not be that much. For instance, if we need more that 72 cells to implement the base functionality we go up into the $5 - $7 price range, and the difference between a 96 cell CPLD and a 144 cell CPLD is fairly small.
<br />
<br />Also Tepples, thank you for the tip about each register bit occupying one macrocell. I had not gotten to the synthisis step yet to see this for myself and I mis-read the documentation. I thought a single register was 32-bits wide. Rather the documentation says that the integer arithmetic pipeline is 32-bits wide.
