		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Goal: A method to play FDS games with perfectly accurate 2C33 audio without using FDS disks (eliminating need for moving parts).<br /><br />Basically, I'm chasing a perfect solution for playing FDS games that will work for years to come. Using the FDS drive with real disks works currently, but since there are moving parts it will undoubtedly wear out over time. Using original FDS disks also does not provide a way to play fan translations. FDS games can also be run from flashcarts, but the games that utilize the additional audio of the 2C33 chip do not sound correct. There's FDS Loader which is fine in theory, but requires a dedicated older computer with DOS and the correct parallel port capabilities to work which is far from ideal.<br /><br />I have 3 ideas that I wonder if anyone has looked into or has enough technical knowledge to comment on the feasibility or work towards a solution:<br /><br />1.) A modern way of loading FDS games straight to he RAM adapter. Basically, think of something like FDS loader but using modern hardware. Even more ideal would be a flash dongle (in place of flashcart) that connects to the FDS RAM adapter to load games to it, thus utilizing the actual 2C33 chip for audio. I doubt anyone is going to whip this up out of nowhere, but I didn't know if someone is already working on a solution like this that I'm unaware of.<br /><br />2.) Integrate the 2C33 chip in a flash cart. I have no idea how feasible this is, but my thought was basically modding the flashcart to hijack the command to engage the FGPA-ized 2C33 and mod in the real 2C33 to be used. I don't know how much of this is internalized to the FPGA that would make it possible or impossible.<br /><br />3.) Mod the 2C33 into the console itself. If #2 is not feasible, then I wonder it would be possible to install the 2C33 in the NES/Famicom itself. I'm not sure how it operates and if the signals it needs to engage can be grabbed from the cartridge pins.<br /><br /><br />I know some people will probably think this is pointless since they consider the audio rendered by flashcarts to be acceptable, but this is for my own persuit of perfection and I'm sure other people would like something similar to what I'm looking for.

Porting FDS Loader to an MCU is the way forward for people uninterested in using an FPGA clone of the FDS synthesizer, such as people verifying whether the FPGA clone is accurate enough. I'm surprised some Arduino fan hasn't done it already.

I bought one, but then I was never able to get a parallel port working (despite many attempts, and several useless hardware purchases).<br /><a href="http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/tutorials/cables/fdsloader-ram-adapter-cable/" class="postlink">http://www.famicomdisksystem.com/tutorials/cables/fdsloader-ram-adapter-cable/</a><br /><br />I've used a CopyNES to load a game into FDS RAM, but it was a convoluted process and I never made it into something easy to use. It completely bypassed the BIOS, just wrote directly to RAM, so it wouldn't be able to deal with disk loads/swaps.<br /><br />I'd really love to find an alternative solution using the FDS loader cable. I am wondering if a Papilio or Arduino could handle it? I've never wanted to take the time to reverse engineer the FDS loader software to learn how the disk protocol works, though; that's the main thing stopping me.
