I think this counts as the second game I've ever finished, and most definitely my first successful game development competition. I managed to get it working even though I had to go and fix a bug in the emulator in the middle of the compo!<br /><br />It's silly, but I had fun making it.

Congratulations to Miau and IsharaComix for being able to come up with something! I really enjoyed the concept of climbing dead bodies in IsharaComix's game. In Miau' game, there's something strange about the bottom carrot in top left cross in level 3... I can't seem to pick it up...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I managed to beat the game in Nintendulator, but that carrot didn't work in some emulators. Which... is pretty strange. Even in Nintendulator, the part of the map that tile is on tended to be impassable.<br /><br />Edit: Wait. More testing, and it's not an emulator thing. I'm not sure what it is. I can pick that carrot up some of the time, and the area of the map is solid some of the time.

It does not occur on every playthrough, as Kasumi mentioned.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bananmos wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Miau's game turned out nicely, but what happened to the pole-stomping?

In the end it more or less became a Pac Man clone, which I was trying to avoid. I'd like to get back to it on another day and fix bugs and experiment with the other ideas that came up in the stream chat, though.<br /><br /><br />Pro Tip for anyone joining a competition like this: Make sure to eat well! It should be self-explanatory, but it's too easy to forget if you're in the midst of a coding frenzy. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">IsharaComix wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It's silly, but I had fun making it.

I like it, the concept is simple and enjoyable. I'd like to be able to end the turn prematurely by pressing B, but then the &quot;10 seconds&quot; theme of the compo would not be met. Then again, I'm not very happy about the timing aspect in my game, either. I found it quite difficult to come up with a solid concept for that theme, to be honest.<br /><br />Also, kudos again for going the pure ASM route and actually pulling through!

It was also buggy on Nestopia according to one reviewer. I test my code on Mednafen and jsNES. If you have the source code for a game with working reset code that you can send me, I might be able to investigate the possibilities.
