Eventually I found my way to metal, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpovE6oBU5U" class="postlink">this</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilYE1LNj7EI" class="postlink">this</a>.
<br />
<br />I remember for years as a kid wanting to find an entire genre of music that sounded like mega man. Metal is just about the closest you can get, I think.
<br />
<br />Now that I'm back into old school NES games, I find myself listening to NSFs as often as I listen to metal and classical (like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfXjk7GkCF8" class="postlink">this</a>).

Only much later I realized that most of the video game music I loved was made in Japan. Because of them I fell in love with the japanese way of making melodies forever. Nowadays I like J-Rock bands that have more metal to them. I really like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGL_5G3Yt8s" class="postlink">X Japan</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl1vv2AjvXw" class="postlink">Moi dix Mois</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr8P2nccGb8" class="postlink">Versailles</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hXNr8gapaU" class="postlink">Area51</a>.
<br />
<br />There are also some animes that have amazing soundtracks. Almost everything from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEnreRtioNo" class="postlink">Saint Seiya</a> is awesome (it has 7 albums of BGMs I think) and has inspired me a lot. The soundtrack of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmKYIQWECWk" class="postlink">Street</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aftZHFSLBzc" class="postlink">Fighter II V</a> is pretty amazing too.
<br />
<br />I do like classical music a lot too.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I don't know how I forgot to mention <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHZsOE3p0io" class="postlink">this</a>. This has got to be one of the greatest melodies I've ever heard.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Mega Man is originally Rockman. Rock is the genre of the music, metal is one of it's sub-genres. It could be very different, from 'big fuzz' to very melodic and beautyful music.
<br />
<br />1980s were the golden years of the metal, thus a LOT of videogames music of the time is heavily inspired by metal (especially on NES and SMD). The sound is different (no distortion etc), but the music structute is the same. You can also find musical quotes of popular rock/metal bands in NES/SMD music.

<br />
<br />That's certainly a strange point of view that you can't understand how other people can like something that you don't like. I also don't get what you're basing your assertion on that (all) metal inspires hate. What a certain piece of music will inspire in a listener - if anything - depends totally on that person.
<br />
<br />Sometimes I feel like listening to calm music, and sometimes I feel like listening to something with a lot of energy. There's no genre of music that is superior to others, because it's such a subjective issue. One can discuss the technical aspects of pieces of music, but I find that largely irrelevant to whether the music is enjoyable or not.

That's my criteria for liking music: if it doesn't make me feel anything, I don't like it. Having started with videogame and classic music, to me a rich melody is the most important thing. Fast pace comes second.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Sometimes I feel like listening to calm music, and sometimes I feel like listening to something with a lot of energy.</div>
<br />I think that in videogames music with a lot of energy really helps to set up the mood, so I think that rock/metal is the best kind of music for action games.
<br />
<br />I guess I do like metal in general, ("Dialectic Chaos" was pretty cool) but I like mostly the melodic parts, and don't like when they make noise just for the heck of it. I guess this is why I like the japanese take on metal, it seems like it has less noise.
<br />
<br />I just remembered of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViHFc1pZ-uQ#t=2m47s" class="postlink">another example of what I think is great music</a>.

<br />Well, there are also NSBM bands, who probably have strong prejudices against groups of people for even less credible reasons. But being a hateful person and inspiring hate in others are two different things. Maybe there's a language barrier here - I don't know.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I agree that there are some metalish songs in Megaman (2). Like the Heatman and Flashman themes. The drums are a bit weak though.
<br />Games like Shadow of the Ninja and Shatterhand are two good examples of games with music that at least sounds like it was inspired by metal.

<br />No I wasn't refering to anything. I don't care about lyrics or anything, it's just that I don't like hear music where there is so much distortion guitar it's hardly music anymore and when the guy who is supposed to sing is actually howling instead. This doesn't sound any close to music in any NES game to me - or are you refering to that a distorted electric guitar can sometimes sound like a square wave ?
<br />
<br />Battletoads sounds like Rock/Hardrock, which I think is not metal, and I like that.

<br />
<br />Mega Man covers an odd spectrum of music if you try comparing it to existing genres with live instrumentation. I definitely wouldn't call it "metal" overall... I don't think you can call it being closest to any one thing really. However, the defining galloping sound of Mega Man 2, to be more specific (title screen, woodman, wily stage 1, etc), is very metal in a similar vein to Iron Maiden. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Not all metal is that distorted- some is very clearly melodic and 'anthemic', which is comparable to some video game music for sure. Perhaps you haven't heard the right stuff, I'm not sure.
<br />
<br />In the case of Iron Maiden, you sometimes have really strong galloping rhythms. Additionally, there are lots of pitches from the vocals that go into vibrato when sustained (very capcomy). I would recommend checking out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_K6sl4jp3A" class="postlink">this track</a> from :58 and on for a bit and see if it doesn't invoke some Mega Man 2-esque vibes for you. Not trying to prove you wrong or anything, just curious to see what you think! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" />
<br />
<br />Also, Castlevania II's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dw5kfLskbw" class="postlink">Dwelling of Doom</a> is often compared to Yngwie Malmsteen's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK0rvReE-4c" class="postlink">Far Beyond the Sun</a>. (listen to 0:35 in)
<br />
<br />Anyways, I'm far from the biggest metal head out there but figured I'd drop my 2 cents.
