Okay okay... let's back this train up a bit.<br /><br />As I originally suspected -- you're using the "bad" kind of .pal file (I didn't think there was any other kind of .pal file, but I assumed you were using the right file -- apparently you weren't).<br /><br />.pal files contain RGB values.  This type of file is for EMULATOR use and has <em>no</em> value to your homebrew.  That "Save Palette File" option in YY-CHR is <em>useless</em> to you.<br /><br />The "Save Palette Set file (*.dat)"  ...  <span style="text-decoration: underline">that's</span> the option you probably wanted.  That exports the actual color ID numbers that you'll use in your game (ie:  $0F = black, $30 = white, etc)<br /><br /><br />So again just to be clear:  you should not be using a .pal file for anything!<br /><br /><br /><br />Now that that's out of the way:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />take the .db files<br /></div><br /><br />I don't know what you were trying to get at here.  .db is an assembler instruction.  It's not a file type.  I don't see any situation where you would have files like "filename.db" in your project.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />transport thoes values in notepad and .incbin<br /></div><br /><br />.incbin = "include <span style="text-decoration: underline">binary</span>".  You should not be .incbin'ing a text file -- only binary files.  If the file is readable in notepad or another text editor -- odds are it's not a binary file.<br /><br />Most tools export binary files -- therefore .incbin makes it so you don't need to do ANY converting.  .chr files are binary, as are the .dat "palette set" files that YY-chr exports.  You can just take those files and .incbin them in where appropriate, and they'll get assembled into the ROM.  No conversion necessary  (of course as tokumaru mentioned -- just getting them in the ROM doesn't mean they'll magically do what you want them to -- you still have to write the code to use them).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />id like to know how to ues both.<br /></div><br /><br />I honestly don't know if it can get any more clear than my previous post.  If you have more specific questions I could try to answer them (but please -- <em>be specific</em> with your questions.  Try to be as clear as possible -- sometimes it's very hard to answer your questions because they're worded poorly and are very vague)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Mon May 01, 2006 7:45 am</p><hr />

Sorry what i meant was for two different questions.  In the beggining i always thought when youll all told me to .incbin to basically take the .db files and transport thoes values in notepad and .incbin.  I ve tried it before and when run the tiles where all jumbled up on the screen. i hope that clears up a little  but what i meant was one or the other.  id like to know how to ues both.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=352">nineTENdo</a> — Mon May 01, 2006 7:04 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">nineTENdo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Why do some use 2, 4, 8. etc.. palletes?<br /></div><br />Because you can change the palettes as the program goes... You'll tipically use a blue palette for a snow level for example, and when the player goes to the next level, a lava one, you'll want to change some colors to red. It would be really hard to make a decent game if the colors were hardwired from start to finish...<br /><br />Just because a large number of palettes are stored in the ROM that doesn't mean they'll all be used at once. Only 8 (4 for sprites and 4 for the background) can be used <strong>at a time</strong>, but you can change them as you like, reading from the ones that are stored in the ROM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />How are these eight different pallete setup on the screen?  Like how do i assign them to a set of 16x16 tiles ( i read somewhere where that you get to use 1 pallete-4 colors per 16x16 tiles)?<br /></div><br />Four of the palettes are used for the background. You use the attribute tables to assign palettes to the 16x16 squares.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also When i do color a sprite or backround in YY-CHR and save the .pal file it never shows up on the screen when i assemble and run.  Im pretty sure those sets of 8 palletes get taken care of when i color my graphics and export a .pal file, but for some reason i doesnt seem to work.<br /></div><br />That's because it doesn't happen automatically. Unless there is code to read and process the palette data and to read and process attribute data, it is meaningless to include the data in the ROM. The NES has no idea what a .pal file is. The code written by a progammer (in this case you) is responsible for interpreting that data.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The only thing im wondering is how i would do that if im using .db?  Do i open a .pal file in a hex editor and tranfer the binaries and .incbin?<br /></div><br />...What? Use either .db or .incbin for a specific set of data, not both... If you already got the .pal file there is no need to write .db statements, just use .incbin.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Apr 30, 2006 8:32 pm</p><hr />

Well Specifically ive seen some code were people use only like 4 sets of the four palletes (ie. $34,$33,$31,$38, $10,$54,$84,$04. etc...) and some use eight.

<div class="quotetitle">Disch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />but many people use Hexecute, XVI32, or Transhexlation.<br /></div><br />Transhexlation rocks !<br />Also, .db can usually work fine for palettes. You usually don't have that much palette data in a game, and doing files with a ridiculous size of 16 bytes or so is not profitable.<br />.incbin is suited for graphics, maps, etc...<br />Also another advanctage of .db is that you can define labels and summons the bytes associed with the labels. For example.<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.define Blue $01<br />.define Red $06<br />.define White $20<br /><br />.db Blue, Red, White</div><br />Will be the same as<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.db $01, $06, $20</div><br />Only, the first time, the think is more readable, and more user-friednly.<br />I don't especially recommand doing this for palettes in practice, because you can't tell a name to all colors (there is too much), but this shows the idea.<br /><br />Of course, the directive isn't always ".define". This varies a lot from assembler to assembler. I took it the way WLA-DX does it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Apr 30, 2006 12:33 pm</p><hr />

I'm assuming you have a hex editor, ninetendo.  If not... I recommend you get one.  There are many free ones available.  I don't really have a specific one to recommend since I use VS's built in hex editor -- but many people use Hexecute, XVI32, or Transhexlation.<br /><br />Anyway.... hopefully to finally solve all your .db vs .incbin concerns:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">What is .db</span><br /><br />.db stores a single byte (or a series of bytes) as given into the assembled binary.  If you give a line like so:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">.db $00, $01, $02, $03, $05<br /></div><br /><br />After assembling, if you open up your ROM in a hex editor and look at the assembled code, you will see a "00 01 02 03 05" in it.  Of course this is only really useful when you identify blocks of data with labels:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">palette:<br />.db $0F, $00, $10, $30<br /><br />some_other_code:<br />  LDA palette     ; this will put '$0F' into A<br />  LDA palette+1    ; this will put '$00' into A<br />  LDA palette+2   ; $10<br />  LDA palette+3   ; $30<br /></div><br /><br /><br />.db is useful for <em>small</em> lookup tables which can be summed up in maybe a line or two.  For larger things (like map data, a large series of palettes, graphics, that kind of thing), using .db would require you to have PAGES AND PAGES of hard-to-edit code which makes it not preferable to use in those situations.<br /><br />For that larger stuff -- that's where you'd want .incbin:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">What is .incbin</span><br /><br />Believe it or not... .incbin is <em>exactly</em> the same as .db.  The only difference is, instead of taking the bytes from the source file, it takes them from an external file<br /><br />To use the above example with .incbin...<br /><br />First you'd need a file that is exactly 4 bytes in size, and contains the bytes:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">0F 00 10 30<br /></div><br />We'll call this file "palette.bin".  Note that the ".bin" extention does not matter -- it's just part of the filename.  You could call it "superfantastic.fun"... it doesn't change the contents or how the file will be interpreted.<br /><br />With that file... we could use .incbin in the following manner:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">palette:<br />.incbin &quot;palette.bin&quot;<br /><br />some_other_code:<br />  LDA palette     ; $0F<br />  LDA palette+1   ; $00<br />  LDA palette+2   ; $10<br />  LDA palette+3   ; $30<br /></div><br /><br />See?  The two are exactly the same.  Using .incbin does the same job of converting everything to .db and copy/pasting into your source -- only it's FAR less work and keeps your files seperate, easier to edit, and more organized.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If .db is working and .incbin is not.  Make sure the file you're .incbin'ing contains the proper values (of course for this, you'll want a hex editor to view/edit the binary files -- a text editor WILL NOT WORK -- don't use notepad or something on a binary file).  Also, make sure you're not misspelling the name of the file you're .incbin'ing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=33">Disch</a> — Sun Apr 30, 2006 12:14 pm</p><hr />

Although there are no standards for this, a .pal file, in the NES centext, is probably a file with color indexes arranged in groups of 4 to form palettes.<br /><br />And please, be a little more specific on your problem descriptions.
