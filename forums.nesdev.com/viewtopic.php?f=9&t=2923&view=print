You said that you verified that it was erased (all bits set to 1), therefore it appeared OK, but you couldn't successfully program it. My idea is that all bits in the erased state is no guarantee that they can all be programmed to 0, so you might also try setting them all to 0 and verifying that, in case any were "stuck" (sort of like bad pixels in LCD screens).
<br />
<br />As for making a file of all zero bytes, I suggest you look into basic file editing tools and how data is stored in a computer system. Read up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor" class="postlink">hex editors</a>.

<br />It sounds like you're not quite sure how to operate your programmer's software.  What software are you using?  How do you know your chips are erased?  How do you know the programming of them is failing?
<br />Also, from a unix prompt you can create a 256KB file of zeros with:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">dd if=/dev/zero of=test.bin bs=1024 count=256</div>
<br />
<br />That is the easy way.  If you are on a DOS based system, just get a hex editor and open a new file, and start typing 00's.  After you have a few, start copying and pasting it repeatedly until you get up to 256KB's worth.

<br />
<br />These kind of EPROMs must be verified that they are empty at 4.5v and programmed at ~6.5v (they operate at 5v).  There are no willem programmers that can go down to 4.5v to do an accurate empty verification, and the USB ones only program at 5V!
<br />
<br />Lastly, I hear the software has a build in tester.  Set the pins as seen in the test H/W tab of the programming software.  Then check all of them.  Lastly, using a volt meter, check the voltage between ground (pin 16) and each one of the pins.  They should all have a voltage!!
<br />
<br />If you find any pins with 0v, that means the programmer is broken.  (e.g. bad dip switch, bad logic ic, etc). 
<br />
<br />These willem programmers do work, but you really need to know how to fix them in order to maintain them.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />The response on willem board was that I must have a bad chip.   I tried a dozen chips and none of em worked so I'm more inclined to blame the programmer or its software.  I also bought an external power supply and still no good.   I had no problem with other (smaller) chips.

<br />So, make a file with 2097152 zeroes.  Copying and pasting is your friend.

<br />Did you test your programmer using a voltmeter and built-in test function?  Good willem programmers have all their IC's socketed.  One of them might have gone bad on you.

<br />I kind of figured that you could just use a one-byte file and let the programmer mirror it, as I figure it has an option to do.

<br />
<br />I programmed other 27c020 chips ok, so i think the programmer is fine.  So your saying that the chips might not be empty because the programmer cant do an accurate empty verification.  Maybe i should erase them longer.
