You either use IRQs or waste time (waiting for a sprite 0 hit). But depending on how he arranges the interface the scrolling window might be at the top or at the bottom, and then only one split will be necessary.<br /><br />Considering the type of program he's making, wasting a chunk of time that big might not be such a problem, as it shouldn't be as CPU-intensive as games. If it's in edit mode, it will only do anything upon user input, and even with some of the time missing the response should still feel real-time enough. In playing mode, I doubt a music playback engine, as complex as it may be, will need more than 50% of the CPU time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Given that someone's already having trouble fitting things into 2300 cycles, I'm not sure how helpful that would be.</div>
<br />By using hardware scrolling he gains a lot of cycles. Also, I said this could be done for data that isn't accessed often, as in not every VBlank. For a game I can think of a few kinds of data I would store there (game status information that is only accessed between levels, checkpoint information, maybe even level maps, depending on their format), but for a tracker I'm not sure, maybe he can think of something.
<br />
<br />Tepples, are you against the idea of using hardware scrolling? 'Cause it seems you showed up just to bash my ideas. I suggested what I did because it's simply impossible to update 400+ bytes of NT data in a single frame (unless a considerable amount of the screen was cut for extra blanking time, but that's not so trivial either).

I <em>want</em> hardware scroll to work. It's just that I investigated this a few years ago when I <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1179" class="postlink">tried to implement an e-book reader with a proportional font on the NES</a>. I ended up needing 1. a more accurate emulator than was available on the DVD player in question, and 2. two split points to change from pattern table 0 to 1 to 0 or from pattern table 1 to 0 to 1 when the player scrolled the text. Around that time, I thought of a long-shot method that involved waiting for sprite 0 at the top split and then abusing DMC IRQ as a crude timer to do something useful while waiting for the bottom split. But then, I had no writable cart to test it on. Now I do, and I want to prove myself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">'Cause it seems you showed up just to bash my ideas.</div>

<br />Everyone's Ron Rivest I guess, you're always looking for problems and alternatives! =) It's true, you are the very definition of the devil's advocate! XD But I guess you are right, in the end that should help us reach a better solution.

<br />OK, so now I'm making progress with the editor side and have pretty much got the Song Editor window working and partly got the Pattern Editor working (you can scroll around it at least).
<br />
<br />I wanted to try a new thing and have video screen-grabbed me navigating around in Nestopia.

<br />
<br />I have a top and bottom margin of 8 pixels (losing the top and bottom line of the screen). I turned on the "NTSC stuff" in Nestopia and it cropped a pixel or two off the right-hand side but you could still see the numbers. Ignore the very top numbers - they are just debug sprites.
<br />
<br />Weirdly, on my TV (NTSC NES-&gt;AV amp-&gt;60Hz plasma), it's the top two lines (of characters) that are cut off and not the top and bottom.
<br />
<br />Is there a definitive guide for this stuff?

<br />No, each TV behaves differently, it seems. IIRC, CRT TVs could even be calibrated (by a technician, not a regular user) so that the image was more centered. I don't know if plasma/LCD has something like that.

<br />Nice <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I just tried this but using VisualBoyAdvance to run the PocketNES ROM. Vertically it's fine as you're only missing the top line of text but horizontally I'm losing the left-most and right-most column.
<br />
<br />The top third of the interface (Song Info, Song Editor) is OK as I can move both of these panels in towards the centre.
<br />
<br />The biggest problem is the Instrument/Table Editor. I need to rethink that bit as it uses the whole 32 char width of the screen.
<br />
<br />The latest version of the editor runs really quite cool in PocketNES. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />However, some of the features require you to hold B+A then press another button but I couldn't seem to make it work (works on the NES). Can anyone that runs this on actual hardware (I'm going to get myself set up) confirm that you can actually do this and it's just a limitation (for some reason) of VisualBoyAdvance?
