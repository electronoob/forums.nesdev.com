I'm not sure if the <span class="posthilit">audio</span> comes from the original <span class="posthilit">audio</span> pin or from the unused pin on which I soldered the bridge, but I'd bet the former, because it was apparently the &quot;standard&quot; expansion pin to bring <span class="posthilit">audio</span> from the NES, as used in Nintendo's MMC5 carts.

But you won't go wrong using a larger one. (The capacitor is a high-pass filter, and the larger the capacitance, the better lower frequencies are passed). If using the 470µF isn't too onerous (cost, size), I'd use it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wrote a message to say that such a huge capacitor was probably not going to work, but apparently there was some problem that prevented it to show up.<br /><br />So I'll say it : Such large capactitors are NOT made for this kind of applications. They have huge parasitic resistors/capacitors/inductors in addition to the large capacitor you'd expect.<br />Don't use those polarised caps.<br /><br />Also I think a resistor will work, but you'll have to try. As for me I'll have to cut a trace and replace it by a resistor.<br /><br />My guess is that YOUR converter has the sound pin open while MY converter has it short with the famicom sound out pin. So I get expantion sound only, and you get 2A03 only. This is just a guess but I think it sums things up.<br /><br />In both cases adding a resistor will make it work BUT the value of the resistor will tell how much loud the external sound is in regard to 2A03. Only trial and error can determine which value of resistor, really.
