All it would do is allow the cart to boot on your NTSC Snes but as soon as the game code will check the video frequency it will give you a ''Not designed for your region'' type of screen.

I'd rather mod the carts themselves and have a stock console.

I'd love to hear I'm wrong on this though<br />so if someone knows different please do tell me so! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If you could describe the earliest point where the game's protection kick in/what it does exactly and I'll at least take a look at it. Thanks<br /><br />Update: Ok, I looked at both games. The Smurfs seem to use the basic PAL protection while The Smurfs 2 doesn't seem to have any protection at all (beside the lock-out chip of course). I obviously didn't finish the game and only played for about one level so it's not 100% but I'm confident this particular protection won't kick in later in game . You can remove the protection from The Smurf using an hex editor. Open up the rom in your Hex editor, go to offset 00000BF4 (or offset 00000DF4 if it has a copier header) and replace the following 3 bytes ''AD 3F 21'' with ''A9 10 00''. If you are scared of Hex Editor, I made you a patch for you to try:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.skinnyv.com/misc/The_Smurfs_SNES_PAL_Fix.rar" class="postlink">http://www.skinnyv.com/misc/The_Smurfs_SNES_PAL_Fix.rar</a><br /><br />This patch is for the rom included in the No-Intro set (Smurfs, The (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).sfc).<br />I encountered some GFX bug on the ACT 1 banner but I also got them on the un-patched rom so it is not caused by the patch. I tested it on a old Tototek flash cart that doesn't apply any kind of fix by it self contrary to newer cart like the SD2SNES does. Let me know if you have any issue.
