<br />I do to.  What I meant was you can check that relative data for zeroes and if so, skip the add.  Or would that "beq" slow down the process enough that it wouldn't be worth the savings?  My relative coords have zeroes in them quite often.

<br />Why is this the case?
<br />
<br />Also, there are games where the character starts above the ground, but fall into it when he moves (i.e. "Metroid").

<br />Because the NES evaluates which sprites it's supposed to draw in one scanline but only draws them on the next one (when it'll will be evaluating the the next sprites to draw and so on).
<br />
<br />I don't know why Nintendo couldn't use an internal counter that was one step ahead (or why they didn't give us access to this counter, which would be much more useful than sprite 0 hits), so that sprites were drawn exactly where told.

<br />Probably patents. Consider that in the 8-bit era, <em>the general concept of a video game itself</em> was patented, and you'll understand how patents on basic raster graphics rendering techniques might have required crazy workarounds.

<br />No, you can't.  Not during normal play when such things might actually matter.  We're not talking about this sort of thing:

<br />
<br />The fact that Castlevania really is off by one but is only noticeable on close inspection further illustrates that this does not matter from a gameplay perspective.  And we've already seen why and how it is dealt with from a programming perspective.

<br />Why are you so defensive about it? I never claimed that it "matters". I just asked why this is the case. I didn't evaluate it, I just wondered about it. So, no need to start a heated debate about if it matters.
<br />
<br />By the was, I'm still asking myself why in "Metroid" you start above the ground, but then fall into it when you start walking. A similar thing can be observed in "Kid Icarus": You start above ground as long as you don't jump. When you jump, you fall into he ground. It's even possible to fall <em>two</em> pixels into the ground.

<br />Now that is strange, must be a bug (unlike many other things in this thread which I think are intentional). I also think in Metroid it's probably intentional.
