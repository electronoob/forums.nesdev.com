He knew what he was talking about, so I'll trust him. I haven't gotten it yet. I'll just see what happens. But I'll come back if I have any questions. Yes, tepples, I was thinking about using 2 6V batteries to add up to 12 volts, but I just didn't know where I would put them, or where I would solder the wire. I'll see when it comes. I'm so excited though, I can't wait till my stuff comes! My EPROMs should come either today or tomorrow, beings as they came from digikey, which is in MN, which is where I live, and they shipped yesterday, so they should be coming, This sentence has too many commas, and stuff. My Willem PCB will be coming by the end of this week, I believe. Okay, with EPROMs, just so I know, they go in the cart with the writing right side up, right?

Okay, so is this normal? I have two Atmel EPROMs, one's an AT27C256 and the other is an AT27C512, and they are too small! I've always heard that people have to make more room for their EPROMs by removing the top bar, and removing some plastic in the cart cover, but this is definitely not the case for me! Did I get the wrong kind? What?

Okay, Here are two pictures of the chip on the board, and I'm wondering which one is right. Forgive me, I had to quick like edit the pictures in paint, becuase my digital camera has BAD quality:

<br /><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/Cart%20008.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.freewebs.com/the_bott/Cart%20008.jpg</a>
<br />
<br />Which one is the correct way? But I was just making sure, when I get my Willem, I can just split the PRG and CHR data with Copynes's software, and open the PRG data, and write that to the 27C512, and open the CHR data and write that to the 27C256, right? And since I kind of scratched apart some IO lines on the cart, I can just drip solder to connect them right?
<br />
<br />Edit: Sorry, for some reason the urls take you right back to this topic page. Just copy/paste them into a new tab in firefox, or window in internet explorer or whatever you use.
