		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I recently got my emulator to draw stuff (yay) and what it basically does is draw the entire background over 341 * 262 or so cycles, and when the background is done, it draws every single sprite it has to draw at once. I know the method is extremely flawed, and I'm going to improve it, but for now I have a different issue: <br /><br />When running the game Mario Bros (not Super, but the original), the sprite of mario gets drawn facing to the left after I start the single player game (i.e. the un-flipped sprite as in the pattern table), and the character just starts automatically moving to the right while still facing to the left. The sprite remains static, and when I press the right button, the character will flip to the correct direction (i.e. the right) and will then proceed to show the walking animation as the walking slightly speeds up. Releasing the right button causes the character sprite to flip to the left again and proceed moving to the right at a slower pace. Pressing the left key keeps the sprite facing to the left, shows the running animation, but speeds up to the right! <br /><br />Even the enemy turtles all move to the right, even though some of them face to the left and some of them face to the right. Basically, this game seems to be unable to move anything to the left. What could be the cause of this? <br /><br />Holding no key (ALL sprites move to the right, Mario sprite facing left, Mario animation static) :<br /><img src="http://s15.postimg.org/fmlmad863/mario_nokey.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Holding right key (ALL sprites move to the right, Mario sprite facing right, Mario running animation showing) : <br />Note that the turtle facing to the left is also moving to the right. <br /><img src="http://s11.postimg.org/8kw74arf7/mario_rightkey.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Holding left key (ALL sprites move to the right, Mario sprite facing left, Mario running animation showing) : <br />Note that the turtle on the upper right is moving to the right over the green pipe even though it's supposed to go left. <br /><img src="http://s21.postimg.org/rvi9mohqv/mario_leftkey.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I did test Donkey Kong (works perfectly), Donkey Kong Jr. (works perfectly), Astro Robo Sasa (works nearly perfectly except the vertical flipping of sprites since I have yet to implement that), dig dug (gets stuck after starting the game and the character digs himself to the middle and there are weird artifacts all over the screen), Arkanoid (writes to $4025 but never reads from it for some reason, and I haven't implemented expansion ROM, so I have a hacky &quot;pseudo-write&quot; in there just to silence the emulator from giving errors, but it works perfectly fine for the 3 minutes I've tested it) and Galaxian (doesn't work well, shows too many enemy sprites, and destroyed enemy sprites don't disappear. Also some movements are glitchy).<br /><br />Does anyone have a clue? I've been on this issue for like 10 hours, and normally there'd be a way to trace to the error, but I couldn't find any. Disassembling Mario Bros was an idea, but the code is so unclear to me that it's practically useless.

I had strange movement bugs in SMB [I know...not the original] when I had a weird bug in my SBC.

I also recall various other games worked seemingly flawlessly even with my SBC bug.<br /><br />Something about always moving in a positive direction makes me think that something's wrong with your SBC.

Other than that, testing the individual Blargg ROMs reveals that, if I remember correctly, everything works perfectly except the BRK instruction (which seems to make the program take a wrong turn at some point). While games don't seem to mind (I think) there are some issues with the I/B/U flags which I'm not entirely aware of (i.e. is the U flag always supposed to be a 1, which some sources claim, or is it always supposed to be a 0, which FCEUX often does and it seems to pass the BRK test). Other than that, everything works fine as far as I know.

In my source, for some reason, the BRK instruction does always push bit 4 as 1, but retains bit 4's original value in the current value of P. I thought I read that somewhere, but I forgot where. <br /><br />Also, if PLP and RTI ignore bits 5 and 4, does it mean that bits 5 and 4 are both set to 0 when pulled, or is bit 5 set to 1 and bit 4 set to 0?<br /><br />PS: Oh, forgot, by U I mean the 'Unused' flag, which is indeed bit 5 in the P register.

It seems that I am handling those bits correctly. It's weird that my program fails Blargg's individual BRK test ROM though. There might be a tiny bug I haven't noticed somewhere in the program which makes it go into a branch where it shouldn't go, as it ends up jumping to $03A0 at the end, which shouldn't happen. I'll try fixing that tomorrow, and if I'm lucky I'll hit 2 birds with one stone and it will fix the glitchy Mario Bros behavior too. I doubt it though, but who knows. If anyone has any other suggestions, please keep them coming.

Thing is, my BRK function appears to be broken indeed, since it apparently incremented the PC after it went to the address at the BRK/IRQ vector, which made my emulator jump to a wrong instruction at some point and throw an exception (or in non-Java terms: give an error). Now Blargg's 14-brk.nes test fails, rather than making my emulator crash (which is good-ish), but I have no clue what the new problem could be. Are there any other tests or things I could do that might pinpoint the issue, or at least get me a bit closer? This is what my BRK and PHP instructions do: <br /><br />BRK: <br />- Pushes high byte of PC value to stack<br />- Pushes low byte of PC value to stack<br />- Sets Interrupt (I) bit in status register<br />- Temporarily sets Break (B) bit in status register <br />- Pushes status register <br />- Sets the PC value to whatever's at the BRK/IRQ vector<br />- Sets Break (B) bit in status register back to its original value before the temporary change<br /><br />PHP: <br />- Temporarily sets Break (B) bit in status register <br />- Pushes status register<br />- Sets Break (B) bit in status register back to its original value before the temporary change<br /><br />Any remarks on what might be wrong?

That I somewhat understand, and although the P register's 4th and 5th bit &quot;don't exist&quot;, they're still supposed to have a value after RTI, PLP and at the initial start of the emulator, no? So from what I've understood, the nonexistent 5th bit is ALWAYS a 1 (probably as a convention), and the nonexistent 6th bit can be anything because it's not supposed to be used anyway?<br /><br />Also, when disassembling games, there are BRK instructions scattered throughout the source, although it's highly likely that those are just filler zeroes or whatever. Really no NROM game relies on it? Then I'm semi-wasting my time trying to fix it I suppose, since my emu goals for now is to just run NROM games perfectly before I start implementing more complex mappers... now I'm still stuck with my Mario Bros issue ._.
