What kind of battery does the NV-SRAM use?  Might I suggest designing the PCB with a coin holder in mind?  Motherboards do it and I typically don't keep them around long enough to change the battery... but my NES carts... they are kept long enough that battery replacement is necessary.<br /><br />Is game transfer still really slow?  Would you consider selling pre-built kits?  You could make more money if you could get price breaks on the ICs... and you could obviously charge for the difficulty of soldering that CPLD.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Fri Jul 29, 2005 11:58 pm</p><hr />

I think I can probably test the mappers independently of everything else, which will help give me confidence it will work when I put it all together.  I'll just remove the MMC chip from some cart, wire in my test implementation from the FPGA and plug it into the NES.

What about some Konami VRC? One of them has like 24 registers, of course all far more rudimentary than a MMC3 register but twenty-freaking-four of them, that seems a little out of a CPLD's scope.<br /><br />Due to the thing being CPLD based, I think PC configuration is the right way to go.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Jul 23, 2005 2:39 pm</p><hr />

If you can stick 6 fat vias on the left edge of the NES board (say holes for 0.1 in spaced pins), then someone can run wires to a CIC chip hanging loose or on a piece of perf (or PCB if you take it out of a MHROM cart) in the top half of the case.  You need a case to put your cart in, and why not make it a crappy sports game or a really common game and rip the CIC out while you're at it.  The lockout defeats aren't particularly complex (feed it -5V, either continously, or in short pulses under game control), but they aren't particularly good either, and can damage toploaders.<br /><br />Tepples: Working FAT32 drivers aren't that big, although they are a pain to write in asm, and 'connectors that wear down', won't wear down any faster than a camera with a socket or the socket in your PC reader.<br /><br />Jagsian, quite apart from the added complexity, you still need a boot ROM, unless he's got bus switches to isolate the NES from the cart while the RAM gets stuffed via jtag, and the user then resets the console (stupid nintendo and their stupid lack of /reset on the card edge, and while we're at it, lack of audio in/out, 2.5 mm instead of 2.54 mm pitch, and 0.047 instead of 0.062 board thickness, grr).<br /><br />109/MIMIC-1, FME-7, RAMBO-1, and MMC3 are all of similar complexity.  You need more register bits and irq bits for FME7 and rambo (well, in a different fusemap, you can use the latch as the top half of the counter instead), but if you can do one, you should probably be able to get them all (although perhaps not at the same time, with the additional mode bits and convoluted low CHR banking logic).  I can't fit MMC3 along with MMC1/discretes though, MMC3 barely fits on it's own into a 128 (although I don't have the A12 timeout/deglitching stuff done yet, but perhaps the external cap is enough), while all the rest fits happily into a 64 (which is what I'm using for now).<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Jul 23, 2005 2:33 pm</p><hr />

It would be the first of its kind!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">How does the CPLD get reconfigured? Through the same parallel cable, or a seperate JTAG cable or what?<br /></div><br /><br />The CPLD gets reconfigured thru the JTAG port. The ROM-chips are also flashed thru the JTAG port, by forcing the CPLD chip to EXTEST mode (can control the outputs freely). The problem is the parallel port is so slow that it takes now an hour to transfer a 512KB game now. I'm thinking about a PIC cable that'd make things faster.</div><br /><br />A PIC controlled MMC/SD flash card slot would be even more ideal.  You'd get good loading speed, and people wouldn't have to tether their cart to transfer games.  Also, you could switch to using volitile RAMs instead of flash, since MMC flash is used as non-volitile storage.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=94">Jagasian</a> — Sat Jul 23, 2005 8:54 am</p><hr />
