		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As for the flickering: the idea only works well when the shades of color are similar. Considering here we're talking about mixing a pale color with black... yeah, that's going to be noticeable just about everywhere, unless your framerate is in like the thousands frames per second or something =P It's better to leave it for smooth gradients only.<br /><br />Also there's the issue that even then the colors don't mix to exactly half each: bright colors are going to impose themselves way moreso than dark colors. This means that if you were to do flickering between black and white, the result wouldn't be 50% gray, but more like around 70% gray.<br /><br />Finally: let's not forget the dot crawl shenanigans =P The effect is also severely affected by this.

Two flickered frames are added in a domain close to that of power, and at a given impedance, power is the square of voltage (or in practice, a slightly higher exponent due to legacy CRT phosphor response curves). So flickering 0% voltage (0% power) and 100% voltage (100% power) gives 50% power, which corresponds to about 71% voltage.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Finally: let's not forget the dot crawl shenanigans =P The effect is also severely affected by this.</div><br />Yeah, when I tried flickering in one of my own ROMs to get more colors, I had to force the alternate dot crawl pattern.

However if something else moves (like scrolling, horizontal or vertical), the shadow can be either entierely black, entierely invisible or any mix of those combinations. It's really hard to describes.
