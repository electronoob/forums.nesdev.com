<br />
<br />CopyNES dumps carts, problem with an internal ROM like that is it's wired directly into the CPU in the system.  Unless the CPU happens to be removable, then you could install the CopyNES board into it - but that only works for original systems and really old clone systems.
<br />
<br />If you can do paypal, they do currency conversion also.  Not sure about Egyptian currency though. (N/M, paypal = credit card anyways, unless they also work your bank)
