<br />
<br />I am having a large run (<em>hundreds</em>) of these 48-pin connectors custom-made and expect to have them soon. What is the demand for them and who wants to buy one? I expect to be able to sell them for around  <strong>$15 a pop</strong>., maybe less depending on the demand I have for them (both types).
<br />
<br />I hope to have them in stock and available to buy within the next 30-days…
<br />
<br />Having them custom-manufactured is the only way to make the buggers in an affordable fashion... Please keep in mind that I’m going out on a limb here by shelling out for this up-front, so you can kiss and adore me later! Letters of love, admiration gratitude and general worship for my awesomeness are welcomed. 
<br />
<br />Volume discounts will apply and I'm taking a huge gamble to them made and to make special expansion devices, so speak up if you want one! Thus, if you want to make that Ethernet adapter or a sound/graphics co-processor, now is the time to speak up about it!
<br />
<br />I also pan to use them for some<strong> expansion-port modules</strong>, such as a plug-in board for the PowerPak FDS (Loopy's) Extra Sound, and a module to plug Famicom expansion devices, like the<strong> 3-D glasses</strong> onto the NES and a kit to add the expansion port to the top-loading NES (NES-101) and Famicom series a bit later on down the road. 
<br />
<br /><em>Is anybody interested in these types of products?</em>

<br />
<br />Regarding making a powerpak fds sound module, I'm sure you could find someone who could solder a 47k resister cheaper than $15 (plus shipping and resistor cost).  I guess some people would be willing to pay the extra cash even if it only makes a difference in a few games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I certainly don’t know if I’m having them made for less than whomever else considered doing this, but I am willing to pay all of the up-front costs associated with making them, plus the cost of producing them in mass quantity, which few others (or in the case of this part, nobody) are willing to do. (As I said, you can kiss me later.) Running a legit electronics firm that has been in business for ages may also help, as I have contacts all over the industry and I can get access to stuff like this. 
<br />
<br />Now, to answer your questions:
<br />
<br />Yes, I plan to sell them as an individual components! These will be around the $14.95 price mark for single piece, or around $125 for ten. I may lower this price if my demand is high, but I don’t yet know how many people will want. I also plan to brand them with a ‘Flashback Vintage Electronics’ name mark and I may offer them in multiple colours for those who want to be fancy, at an extra cost. 
<br />
<br />Devices designed to plug directly into the port:
<br />The FDS-Sound mod board is only one example, and will probably be around $15-20, as I have to assemble them by hand to start and blank through-hole PCB isn’t cheap these days. 
<br />
<br />I am open to suggestions on other uses that you would want. I think that an adapter to use the 3-D system, Keyboard, etc, would also be nice, but this would require making a plastic housing, designed the mate underneath the NES. Is anyone here skilled enough in plastic to make something like this (in resin or epoxy material?
<br />Is anybody good enough with 3-D cad to model what it will look like for rapid-prototyping? (I have contacts with rapid-proto ‘plastic printers’)&gt;
<br />
<br />Lastly, does anybody have a project in mind for this port at present that they would we willing to develop in tandem with me? This port offers unlimited possibilities, including co-processor, custom chip, RAM or other expansion boards, or even PC-Link boards. 
<br />
<br />If you want to make something using this connector, please contact me to talk about it (via PM or e-mail).
<br />
<br />You can e-mail me at (remove the “(nospam)” tags):
<br />flashback@(nospam)AtariUSA.com -and- design_by_xs@(nospam)yahoo.com 
<br />Or ring my mobile at: 908-616-8747. I look forward to serving the community and assisting developers in making new hardware products and games for the NES.

<br />
<br />This gives me something to think about, as I'm currently redesigning my "Squeedo" dev cart.  Problem is, an extra connector and 2nd board would make the whole kit even more expensive than it already is.. but the idea of having some portion of it's functionality carry over to other carts is <strong>very interesting</strong>.

<br />
<br />I should have the first samples in a couple days and then, after I check all the measurements, I will get the final product within the following 3-to-2 weeks. 
<br />
<br />I'm kinda' needing to know how many units people will want to buy or will need. I can always produce more, but the higher number of units that can be made from the mould at once, the less the cost per unit; I can't negotiate a pro-rate. 
<br />
<br />I am curious to know what devices you have in mind and I have an idea of my own and will need someone very experienced with the NES to carry it out. Somebody with Brian's skill... I also need an FPGA and CLPD expert. Is anybody interested in helping to make the most exciting NES expansion product ever conceived?
<br />
<br />Thus, if you want to order them in tens, packs of 25, etc, I need to know; else my first batch will have a sales limitation of five or ten pieces per person.  I also need to know what mounting package you most desire!
<br />
<br />If there is anybody who wants to cooperate o n an idea for a NES expansion unit, please PM me; I won’t discuss the details in the eyes of the public. Together we can breathe new life into this platform with an exciting new idea of mine... 
<br />
<br />For everybody else, I will post photos as soon as I have one of these in my hands.  Look for updates soon!

In fact I even think Nintendo was planning this, as their MMC5 boards have connectivity for extra audio. Maybe they were probably planning to have an western FDS plug down there ? At least I know it was planned then cancelled, but I don't know if it was going to be plugged here.

<br />Here's my guess: It was originally planned to have the RAM cart in the cart slot and the disk drive on the bottom like the Satellaview and 64DD. Each pin on the expansion bus between the CPU and PPU buses would correspond to one pin of the cable between the FDS RAM cart and the disk drive. But I suspect Nintendo canned it after seeing the mass copyright infringement of FDS disks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now that I think about it, the expansion connector doesn't allow that much to what cartridges didn't allow.
<br />It allows expansion sound, this is one fact.
<br />
<br />It also allows a device to triggers NMIs while you could only trigger IRQs with cartridge. However, I don't really see where NMIs could do something IRQs couldn't (especially considering you'll have to have code detecting VBlank NMIs and expantion port NMIs at the start of each NMI).
<br />
<br />It allows some device to be easily connected through $4016 or $4017 ports as long as it doesn't conflict with the controller ports.
<br />
<br />This is pretty much all. Co-processors, etc... is of course possible but it's also possible in a cartridge. The only thing is that there is no the area limitation of a cartridge board. Communication also might be simplified by the $4016 and $4017 ports to avoid having to place extra logic on the board holding the extra co-processor.
<br />
<br />But I don't think a device plugged into the bottom connector could be ever completely separed from cartridges. For example let's admit you have a powerful processor capable to do mode-7 like operations on 2BP bitmaps. Then the game would have to send bitmap data a few bits at a time trough $4016 and $4017, and in VBlank when the calculation has been done, read $4016 and $4017 to get data to write to VRAM few bit at a time. This obviously would be way too slow. So extra logic has to be fit in the cartridge to handle this and use other expansion pins to fast things up. Then the whole logic might just as well be in the cartridge, and the expansion port is still useless.
