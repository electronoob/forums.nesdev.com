<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />some Video processing chip etc are not common practice anymore (or hard to find)?<br /></div><br /><br />Yup pretty much. All graphics chips from the 80s with NES-like capabilities are no longer in production. It is possible though to find certain chips like the 6845 and 6847 for sale at some online stores, though they aren't really good for games. The 6847 is characters only with no sprites, and has only 9 colors. The 6845 is character based as well, but requires extra video hardware to display the actual pixels. All it does is send character indexes to the external signal-producing hardware and generate horizontal and vertical sync pulses. It is flexible but not very powerful. The TMS9918A, along with the V9938 and V9958 are better but harder to find. The TMS9918A was used in the MSX, TI 99/4A, and Colecovision, so games for those consoles should give you an idea of its power. It has tile graphics and sprites, but it has only two colors per tile (one if you use transparency) and a palette of 15 colors. The V99x8 series is awesome and is slightly more powerful than the NES's PPU, but isn't that common, as far as I know. From what I've read the series was only used in upgraded versions of the MSX and TI 99/4A.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What would be really cool is a NES style system with 4BPP graphics even if there were no attributes (so you could have one 16 color palette for the entire background).

It will basically cost a suitable FPGA training board, ones with plenty of on-board memory to hold a game now cost around $100. My ~$130 board (1.2M NEXYS2) can theoretically implement just about any *16-bit* arcade/console I know of and has 16 MiB of RAM and 16 MiB of Flash. Very powerful, but IMO very tiring to develop for because synthesizing/compiling is SOOO slow it makes debugging infuriating. I'd stick with a software virtual console (same goes for XGamestation people) until you're sure you know what you want and how to get there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Wed Feb 18, 2009 8:52 pm</p><hr />

I know that this reply is off topic and the thread may get split but since we are talking about the xgamestation (the build it yourself console) I want to know something.<br /><br />How feasible would it be today to make an home made 8 bit console that as similarity to the nes (tile based graphics, chip music, maybe 6502 based or not) but that is not a clone of it? So the goal is not to run nes game on it but just have a 8 bit platform with similar features. How much costly would it be?<br /><br />That something I would love to do someday if I had the electronic background.  I guess for now it just one of many "todo" on my list.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Wed Feb 18, 2009 7:12 pm</p><hr />

It sounds really powerful on paper, but trust me, it's not as powerful as it sounds. It's somewhere between an NES and a Super NES graphics wise. If you're looking for an authentic 8-bit system, though, they do have consoles with 8-bit microcontrollers: <br /><br />-<a href="http://www.xgamestation.com/view_product.php?id=32" class="postlink">The XGS Pico</a>, which has a SX28 (3kb Flash, 144 bytes RAM, 80MIPS) and not much else. The composite video signal has to be generated by the CPU, and you can get 10 greyscale shades with it, and can do color if you have REALLY tight timing. There's a 4-bit DAC to do sound with and one joystick port. Everything has to be done by the processor, and its memory is tiny, which makes it difficult to make games with. On the plus side you can order the parts yourself and put it together on a breadboard, and it's also the cheapest console on the site.<br /><br />-<a href="http://www.xgamestation.com/view_product.php?id=12" class="postlink">The XGS Micro</a>, which is pretty much an upgraded Pico. It has the larger SX52 microcontroller (6kb Flash, 262 bytes RAM, 80MIPS), plus 128kb of slow access RAM, two joystick ports, a sub-NES-quality sound chip, and hardware for generating a color signal, which saves a large amount of processing time. There's a few extra ports for things like keyboards and mice as well. The composite video signal also has to be generated by the CPU here, but the 128k of RAM, which can be used as a frame buffer, makes it much easier to do games. It's still pretty hard to code for, though.<br /><br />-<a href="http://www.xgamestation.com/view_product.php?id=46" class="postlink">The XGS AVR / XGS 8-bit</a>, which is WAAAAAY better then the others if you want to develop games. It has an AVRMega 644 at its core (64kb Flash, 4k SRAM, 28MIPS) and has hardware for generating both VGA and composite signals. The CPU still has to play an active part in generating the signal, though. Sound is done using the AVRMega's PWM output (I think). It can also load programs from MicroSD cards. Of all the 8-bits listed here I recommend this one the most.<br />Demo programs made for the XGS AVR:<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1N-2ftYgU&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">XGS Blasters</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK2MMMTw3SY&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">Ultra demo</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgAvTf52SgE&amp;feature=channel" class="postlink">Doom-style raycaster</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1345">CartCollector</a> — Wed Feb 18, 2009 6:16 pm</p><hr />
