		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This question was brought up on another forum and it has me quite curious. 
<br />
<br />This game seems to consistently have major graphical issues seemingly caused just by the cart connection. To elaborate, the game program is running fine but the graphics are messed up, but not in the dirty connection way with garbled tiles and/or lines. Instead, the picture seems to be formed just fine, but the screen shakes around violently. It seems as if there is a problem with the timing of the drawing. Some people have said they can correct the problem just by adjusting the cart in the NES. I can't. The ROMs must be making the connection just fine though because even in this condition, I can dump the cart and get 100% valid data.
<br />
<br />From what others have said, it seems the majority of these carts have the exact same problem. It just uses a typical NES-TLROM-03 w/ MMC3B
<br />
<br />If anyone would like to see the problem for themselves, I could capture a short video of the issue.

That could definitely cause the screen to shake as the TV decides it sees a sync signal.  Don't know why repositioning the cart would work.  Might try different TVs with the same cart/NES.

<br />Unless there's an issue with sprite 0 that shows up only during the sprite-pattern-fetch phase of the scanline.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe why it shakes so much is that in addition to using low-voltage color $0D, it also uses all the color deemphasis bits to make the screen darker, lowering $0D's voltage to 1.043 volts, 0.243 relative to sync according to <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=2113" class="postlink">this thread</a>.   The Immortal also uses $1D in the title screen for the wizard's black, which with all the bits set, could also potentially cause problems, since it's voltage is only slightly more than $0D with no bits set (and that already causes problems with Game Genie).  I guess Electronic Arts didn't really care because it was 1990, and I guess most TVs during that time were able to output the low levels properly.  Out of curiosity, how old is the TV you used, BootGod?
<br />
<br />About Sprite 0, tepples, are you suggesting that The Immortal uses sprite 0 hit?  Having personally finished the game, I don't think it uses sprite 0 hit or even any split-screen effects (the IRQ is just an RTI instruction).  Since it doesn't use sprite 0, how else could sprite 0 or the processes for sprite 0 hit mess up the game?

<br />
<br />I have actually seen more problems with recent LCD tvs instead of CRT ones.  This is only based on a sample of ~8, but the LCDs may be trying to do more strict voltage levels.
<br />
<br />The 0D + emphasis may be the full reason why Immortal is especially bad.

<br />Wild guess, given all the topics in NESemdev about games freezing when sprite 0 logic fails.

<br />The only sprite 0 hit MMC3 game I've ever played so far is Gauntlet.  It's used on the title screen, the scrolling text for Morak's trashtalk after those clue-finding levels, when you need to enter the password for the last 100th level (Morak is the red-hooded blue guy), and for the scrolling text in the ending.  There might be more games, though.

<br />
<br />Actually yes it is an LCD TV I was trying it on. I will try to hook it up to an old CRT later and see if it is any different.

And it must be due to the combo of using that color and it using color deemphasis bits like strangenesfreak said because my LCD doesn't have problems with other games that use 0x0D, at least in the ones mentioned, Maniac Mansion and Skate or Die 2.

<br />
<br />The games, IIRC, were Astyanax and Snake, Rattle, &amp; Roll.

<br />Any ideas?
