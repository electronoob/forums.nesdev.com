		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been working on getting Akumajo Densetsu up and running on my NES. So I've stuck it in a gyromite case with a nice little label and everything is pretty great except for the fact that now I have to figure out how I'm going to deal with the whole VRC6 issue. I figured I'd have this all figured out by the time the cartridge was ready, but the more I've read, the more I've confused my self because every guide has a slightly different goal (extended audio from a powerpak, extended audio for an stereo modded NES, weird cart mods, etc etc) and sometimes quite different instructions for reasons I can never quite figure out. So I figured, even though this topic seems to have been done to death, that I'd just ask.<br /><br />So basically my goals are to get Akumajo Denetsu's audio working on my mostly unmodded toaster NES, while, when possible, trying to keep the mod future proof for whatever mods or products I might get in the future, by modding my NES and gyromite converter. Also considering using a volume pot for the extended sound but I guess that's kinda optional?<br /><br />So the sources I'm working off of are... <a href="http://callanbrown.com/index.php/castlevania-iii-with-full-famicom-audio" class="postlink">Callan Brown's 'Cart with an audio cable'</a> mod,<a href="http://theshizz.org/forum/index.php/topic/28440-catch-all-system-hardware-mods/page-5#entry1123166" class="postlink">Zoast's full audio mod</a>, <a href="http://54.org/sage/condev/NESMods/NESMods_Sound_Input_On_Pin_18.jpg" class="postlink">this picture (which is using a 100K resistor in series with a 4.7uF non-polarized cap)</a> and [ur=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z507PxcLjsl]this youtube video[/url].<br /><br />So some things that pop out to me...<br />Zoast's and the powerpaks mod use different pins on the expansion port and all that. Should I mod my gyromite cart to output to the same pin as the powepak one?<br />Zoast doesn't use any resistors at all. I assume this is because he's mixing all the audio externally. Are the resistors only for volume management and if so, does it matter if they're on the cart or in the NES? What are the advantages of one over the other?<br />The image with the capacitor seems totally in a different place than the other mods. Is there any real advantages/disadvantages to that configuration?<br /><br />This is my first real NES mod besides disabling the lockout chip and changing my pin connector, so sorry if I'm a bit slow with all this. Just wanna make sure I'm going about this mod intelligently before I start throwing solder around.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's likely that the PowerPak's scheme is more widely used, if you want more likely compatibility with other NES-external-sound cartridges (<s>oh wait, the PowerPak doesn&#39;t come with it wired by default, it&#39;s just a mod some people do?</s> PowerPak does come wired for expansion sound). On the other hand the RCA cable approach is basically zero-risk/mess inside the NES (those pictures inside the modded NES consoles made me cringe). If it's only one game you're doing this for, it seems better. It makes the game compatible with a more stock NES (I take it the lockout chip must be disabled). It also makes level adjustment/novel mixing trivial.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that's definitely the backup plan. Might be silly, but the aesthetics of all this are kinda important to me. Having a big ugly cable hanging out of the cart kinda bothers me. I've considered trying to stuff a small minijack onto the case somewhere but I don't see that fitting inside the cart? But if I could do that it'd be an easier, more portable mod and would be kinda cool in it's own way...<br /><br />Still favoring an internal mod though, but I think I'll at least look around for audio jacks to see ifI could possibly make something happen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay just trying to clear things up on the cartridge side. If I wanna set my self up like a powerpack, I want to do FC side pin 45 to (and around the converter) to NES side pin 54? Then after that, any powerpak compatible mod on the NES console side will work? Should I put any resistors on the cart or save that for the NES? After that I feel pretty much ready to get this done.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On my Gyromite NES-Joint I connected the audio loop out to the powerpak's audio EXP pin. This is just a wire, not a resistor.<br /><br />Inside my NES, I did the &quot;powerpak audio mod&quot;, but instead of connecting a resistor from the EXP pin to the audio pin, I put in a 100k potentiometer. This lets me adjust the volume of the expansion audio mixing; this is useful because the mixing via this mod is different than what a Famicom would do (i.e. looping it through the cart), so being able to adjust it can help a lot.
