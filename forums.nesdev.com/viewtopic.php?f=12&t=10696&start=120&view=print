I'm chronically behind on my research, so I end up in a mild panic whenever I do anything else.<br /><br />The impulse responses are different for different input frequencies, as I mentioned earlier.  I only did 16 and 32 kHz; here are the full impulse responses at 24-bit resolution:<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br />The 16 kHz one clipped when I used 50% amplitude as an input, so I went with 25% for both.<br /><br />Since the filtering is done at the specified input sample rate, rather than at a higher rate for later resampling, the 16 kHz one should be applicable at a range of sample rates as long as they don't approach 32 kHz.  If the response near 32 kHz works the way I suspect it does, it's probably not hard to come up with a differential filter that could be applied before resampling or something like that, so that the lower-rate filter would then work across the whole range, but I really have to stop this for the moment and do some work...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">psycopathicteen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think I'll just stick to plain vanilla 16kHz BRR for now.</div><br />That's probably a good idea.  In addition to complicating the sound driver, this scheme requires <em>somebody</em> to do a lot of fiddly sequencing; I really don't have the time right now and I can't really ask anyone else to do it.  (I was hoping someone with actual SPC700 expertise would take an interest and volunteer, but...)  Plus, since it doesn't require any extra CPU time, it won't disturb the video codec, meaning it shouldn't be especially hard to add in later.<br /><br />How do you plan to stream the audio?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I hesitate to bump this thread, but I don't want this stuff scattered around the forum, and anyway it's not a whole lot less relevant to the topic than it was the first time...<br /><br />I've modified my 16 kHz filter slightly, adding a very narrow 1.1 dB cut at 7,860 Hz.  You might not hear a difference, but it now meets the +/- 0.2 dB ripple spec right up until the plot starts to go nuts in a case-dependent fashion a little past 7.8 kHz.  The IR is significantly longer than the first version, possibly because the new filter is very steep, or possibly because I ran out of filter slots in PLParEQ3 (it's in the name) and had to use a second instance, so the up- and down-sampling was done twice.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

A high-frequency sine wave with strong triangle LFO pitch modulation at ~18 Hz seems to work well enough, particularly with some reverb added.<br /><br />The new sample is well over a second long, with the result that the whole sample pack is now 54,468 bytes.  It's not all that tough to get a half-decent-sounding loop, but I'm probably not going to try to optimize until it's clear there's a need.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br />Oh, and the new sample is much louder than it should be with respect to the other samples, because it was synthesized rather than lifted from the (CD version of the) track itself.  My excuse is that it's better to use one's ears at mix time rather than attempting to gain-correct things <em>a priori</em> and getting them slightly wrong but not wrong enough to notice until it's too late...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Cool.  Getting closer...<br /><br />Are you just using a tight loop then?  That would certainly explain the extra slowdown.  The reduced pitch does make it nicer to watch through to the end, since it kind of stays in sync (it crashes to a garbage screen after finishing).<br /><br />Also, there seems to be fairly regular popping in the audio, which I assume is not part of the data itself.  Could it be related to bank boundaries?<br /><br />How much spare CPU time do you have without the music?  Did you manage to completely eliminate the slowdown?  I figure it should be possible to use HDMA to get the audio overhead down to a few percent of a frame.

And of course the pitch is a bit low; I assume this is a temporary measure to compensate for the slowdown.<br /><br />Snes9X freezes, and ZSNES doesn't even start.  I can't run it on a real SNES; my Super Everdrive complains that the file is too big...
