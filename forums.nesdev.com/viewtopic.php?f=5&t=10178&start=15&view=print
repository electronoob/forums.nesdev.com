That was one of the games (prior to launch) which I made note of to pick up/try, since I do like games of that sort, but the DRM situation immediately made me change my mind.  I'm glad Ubisoft reverted their stance on that.</div><br /><br />To be fair, this is Ubisoft we're talking about. What happens now is that the game gets bound to a &quot;Uplay&quot; account. If you don't have one you have to make one. Maybe I mispoke, but if you want to resell a digital copy of the game, it probably still isn't possible. A decade or so in the future the I bet the DRM won't matter, as an exploit eventually surfaces... but I don't know if this still appalls you enough to stay away. What's gone is the &quot;always on, always connected&quot; requirement. You only have to be connected at activation. It won't do stupid things like deactivate if you change your graphics card anymore.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/05/ubisoft-drm-piracy-interview/" class="postlink">http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/05/ubisoft-drm-piracy-interview/</a><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">One of the two (I forget which) had performance problems up the ass (apparently the entire game, every part of it, was run in a single thread -- and the developers stated this was by design -- so within 15 minutes of play you were getting, at most, 30-35fps on a high-end quad-core system), while the others had bugs beyond belief.<br /></div><br />The most noticable bug Anno 2070 has is sound related. Sounds and eventually music stop playing about about 5 continuous hours of being ingame. What you do is go to options - sound and pick &quot;the other&quot; sound driver. Then go back to the game, then switch it back if you want.<br /><br />Otherwise, this has been the most rock-solid game software I've played on PC in a decade. It's kind of the thing where I think that the people getting crashes or stuck have to have broken hardware, overclocking, bad drivers, or are assuming they need to do something when it's really a need to do something else... Sometimes it's just explore the map more so the game can prompt with the next event in its script... it can't prompt it until it's visible to you. There's one mission in the campaign where the water is poisoned and your population is literally starving and you can't build a fishery... This isn't a bug, it's trying to teach you something (about how to fix it).<br /><br />As for framerate, there is a lot that has to be happening for it to start to significantly drop frames. I've never gotten it to dreadfully chug along as a slideshow (but I have an SSD and 16 gigs of RAM and a midrange ATI card that I bought based on low wattage, not raw performance). The game smoothness is video card bound, not CPU bound.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I even posted some actual bugs (again can't remember which of the two) on their forum, including running one with Visual Studio installed and trying to debug bits/pieces of it, and not a single employee/developer commented.  It's like the companies that made them released a bunch of crap and then stuck their fingers in their ears.<br /></div><br /><br />The biggest problem is when most games ship from traditional publishers they're <span style="text-decoration: underline">DONE</span>. (Underlined for emphasis). There's no money for ongoing support after the contract is fulfilled. (BTW I hate this too). Now, Related Designs did an incredible job with this game, and have one single patch, the 2.0 patch. Plus you could consider the Deep Ocean expansion another patch. But, I don't think they're going to spend any more time on it, sadly, because they're waist-deep working on other things to make money. As I said, I think the game is actually &quot;complete&quot; in the sense that it functions the way it was intended and has all the content in it. Is the AI exploitable? Of course, because humans are just that fricken clever. But if this game as-is was slated to be on a cartridge after the 2.0 patch, it would be final version.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Lately, I have been playing Seiken Densetsu 3 all the way through with my wife. Thanks to the SNES powerpak and my compulsive need to back everything up dozens of times, we were able to start back before we caused a game-breaking glitch by using a magical rope within the Darkness Castle to go re-stock.<br /><br />Other games I've been playing have been:<br />-Ninja Gaiden 3 on the NES. I am sort of on hiatus from it right now, but my goal is to beat it &quot;legit&quot; within the 5 game overs it gives you at the beginning of the game. It's pretty tough!<br />-Super Meat Boy (sorta losing interest in it, but really enjoyed the hospital level due to the music)<br />-Super Hexagon (very fun game with cool chiptune music, the feel of the game seems like an atari 2600 game with very simple graphics---though I don't think the atari could actually pull this off technically, I mean purely in terms of style)<br />-VVVVVV...excellent retro platformer with awesome chiptune music. really enjoyed this one.<br />-Team Fortress 2. I suck horribly at it and probably don't have a great connection, but its fun anyway. I like that it brings humor back to this style of game.<br /><br />I saw someone mention Zelda: A Link to the Past. I definitely want to play through that again soon...and...I also hope to play through Final Fantasy 6 with my wife. What is it with girls and rpgs? It's the only type of game you can convince them to play.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm still a gamer and like to try all kind of games, I just don't have the same time as before to try all of them. If I can find 20 minutes during the day, I'm quite lucky.  Usually it is more close to 0 these days.<br /><br />I will either play the latest action games or older retro ones. As long it is good, I will try it.  I finished recently the latest Tomb Raider. I liked it more than the previous ones.  Now I'm experiencing with DMC and Biohazard Revelation. DMC  (PC version, faster frame rate) may not be the original Dante and that's irks me a little bit but the game by itself is quite good (if you forget that it's devil may cry) and quite nice looking too. For Revelation, the graphics looks dated for a PC game but it is closer to the original Biohazard compared to the other ones.  Simplistic but good.<br /><br />Basically, if the game is good, I want to try it. Another thing I did recently is getting a lot of old pc abandownware and hope to play someday like Future Wars or Police quest, stuff like that.<br /><br />I wish I had more time to play thought.
