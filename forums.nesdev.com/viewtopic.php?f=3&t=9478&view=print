		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A recent thread discussed methods for synchronizing audio and video rates.  nemulator dynamically resamples audio to match the video frame rate.  I think this works well -- video stays locked to vsync so there is no tearing or stuttering, and the changes in audio frequency are not noticeable.<br /><br />I've received good feedback from people who've tried it out, but I've never really solicited feedback from this group.  Please give it a try and let me know what you think.  A couple of notes:<br />- F9 toggles display of stats<br />- F4 toggles a graph of output frequency (green line) and output buffer position (red line; red area is the target that it's trying to keep the buffer position at)<br />- If you have a non-60Hz display, I'm especially interested in how well this works as I've been unable to test (make sure app.timer_sync is set to true in nemulator.ini)<br /><br /><img src="http://nemulator.com/images/audio.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />James

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some games place a bunch of sprites in the same scanline to do sprite masking.  Zelda 1 and Gremlins II are two games I can name of the top of my head that do this.<br /><br />If you want to throw out the sprite limit, but still support this kind of sprite masking, you can detect it easily.  Look for 8 early sprites (may or may not include sprite 0) with the same Y coordinate and same tile number, that's a sure sign that it's trying to mask those scanlines.<br /><br />edit: Sorry, can't test the emulator, I'm on Windows XP.

There are lots of games that look better with the sprite limit disabled, but there are also lots of games which behave oddly/look awful unless sprite limit is enabled.  Here's a list of games I've found which look/behave oddly when sprite limit is disabled:<br /><br />* Castlevania 2 -- when Simon is standing a swamp the lower half of his body is visible<br />* Majou Densetsu 2 - Daimashikyou Galious -- when Populon enters a door, his entire body is visible as the sprite is moved downwards.  Just see these two videos I made some time back: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzuCraI3gE0" class="postlink">#1</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8gxuW3Asgk" class="postlink">#2</a>.<br /><br />I'm certain there are others, but those are the two I can name off the top of my head.  So please, like I said, make this a toggleable feature (default should be sprite limit enabled, just like the real hardware).

This is important because a lot of laptops, mine included, drop the display refresh rate when running on battery. Here's your statistics and graph.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9IxSt.jpg" alt="Image" />

Disabling vsync (nemulator.ini: app.vsync = false) should fix that.  Maybe I should automatically disable vsync if the refresh rate is less than ~60Hz...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">natt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">With timer sync, audio is correct at 75hz refresh, though.</div><br />ok, good.  Is video smooth at this refresh rate, or do you see any stuttering when scrolling?<br /><br />Thanks for testing, guys.
