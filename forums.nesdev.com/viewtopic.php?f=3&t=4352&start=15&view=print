<br />What's the matter with BlockRead? That's what I always use to read binary files in Delphi.
<br />
<br />So, you don't know how to work with bits? That will be a big problem! How well do you know binary numbering system? This is extremely important if you hope to have any understanding of the NES.
<br />
<br />Anyway, in Delphi (or any other language for that matter), bits can be manipulated with bitwise operators like AND, OR, and XOR. When you got a value, in order to know if a particular bit is set or clear you have to AND the value with a bitmask, and if the result is not 0 then the bit is set. AND can be used to read and clear bits, while OR can be used to set bits. XOR is mostly used for inverting bits.

<br />
<br />I understand binary pretty much, but when I use BlockRead to gain 1 byte that returns me 2 integers, I don't see how to make that 8 bits of data.
<br />
<br />I'm not overly familiar with using those operators outside of general logic and a few other mathematical things.
<br />
<br />It's more of a problem with not understanding how Delphi is doing things when I BlockRead and convert the values to Ascii text (that's what I do for getting NES from the header, although it comes up NES-&gt;8 instead of NES^8 like the .NES format specification shows, could be the font though *shrugs*).

<br />Gee, I have never used Delphi 2007 (the newest I used was 7), but I have never had problems reading single bytes out of files... when you opened the file, did you specify the record size of 1 (Reset(whatever.nes, 1);)? It should work. Just look for a few examples of this procedure and you'll eventually make it work.

<br />
<br />Yes I can get a single byte, the issue is a single Bit value (the bits of the byte).
<br />
<br />I have recently learned I need to use an AND operator in some fashion to gain a specific bit value from a byte, I am not 100% on exactly how to go about it, but I am starting to understand it better.

<br />
<br />Here's a chart that I found that will help you:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Bitwise Operators:<br />Operator&nbsp; &nbsp; Delphi&nbsp; C#&nbsp; &nbsp;Visual Basic .NET<br />And&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&amp;&nbsp; &nbsp; And<br />Not&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;not&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~&nbsp; &nbsp; Not<br />Or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; &nbsp; Or<br />Xor&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xor&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;^&nbsp; &nbsp; Xor<br />Shift-left&nbsp; shl&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp; &nbsp;None<br />Shift-right shr&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;None<br /></div>
<br />
<br />If you want to read a bit, you will want to isolate it with an "and" operation. After that, it depends what you want to do with it.

<br />Sound right?

<br />Testing on original Mario Bros ROM I have, I output so far:

<br />I use Chr() after BlockReading first 5 bytes using a for loop to get Nes&gt;8 (&gt; is some funny character I don't know the ALT code for), and IntToStr to get after getting the byte/bit for the next 3 values.
<br />
<br />Would these values be correct for this particular game? (So I know I am on the correct track).

If the result is 1, the bit is set, if it's 0, the bit is clear. Although "1bitBufferFor6" is a pretty weird name for a variable!<br /><br />The basis of the binary system is that each bit position, when set, represents a value:<br /><br />bit 0: 1<br />bit 1: 2<br />bit 2: 4<br />bit 3: 8<br />bit 4: 16<br />bit 5: 32<br />bit 6: 64<br />bit 7: 128<br /><br />These are the values you use to read each of them. Note that it's possible to combine these bits to form any number between 0 and 255, so this is how the binary system works.<br /><br />Just to make sure you understand: Say that the byte you have is 01001101 in binary (77 in decimal). To read the status of bit 0 you use the mask 00000001 (1 in decimal). The AND operator performs the AND operation on each pair of bits (the bits that occupy the same positions in the 2 numbers). AND only outputs 1 when both inputs are 1, meaning that if the result was not 0, it's because the bit that was in the same position as the one in the mask is set.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I use Chr() after BlockReading first 5 bytes using a for loop to get Nes&gt;8 (&gt; is some funny character I don't know the ALT code for), and IntToStr to get after getting the byte/bit for the next 3 values.</div><br />Sounds messy! You are reading a binary file, you shouldn't rely on ASCII characters or strings, because the information that's there is just not text. And you shouldn't be reading integers, but bytes.<br /><br />If want to do this right, don't just write what works, spend some more time getting it to work as it should. you shouldn't bother about the representation of the 4th byte, it wasn't meant to be read as a string. If I'm not mistaken, it's supposed to have the value $1A (hex), and that's all you should care about.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Would these values be correct for this particular game? (So I know I am on the correct track).</div>
<br />I don't know. Load the game in Nestopia and select View -&gt; Image Info and compare the info to what you've got.
<br />
<br />So, I just tried the following code in Delphi 7 and had no problems reading the header as an array of bytes:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">var gameFile: file;<br />var header: array&#91;0..15&#93; of byte;</div><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; AssignFile&#40;gameFile, 'makai.nes'&#41;;<br />&nbsp; Reset&#40;gameFile, 1&#41;;<br />&nbsp; BlockRead&#40;gameFile, header, 16&#41;;<br />&nbsp; CloseFile&#40;gameFile&#41;;</div>
<br />Then to detect the state of bit 0 of byte 5 you'd just do (header[5] and 1), if the result is 0, the bit is clear, otherwise it's set.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My intention is not to be rude toward you but I would suggest you that before that you tackle your emulator project, you should do a little bit of practice regarding bit manipulation and how to take advantage of your developing environment  (in your case, delphi 2007). 
<br />
<br />This first step will make your life a lot more easier.  If you don't, you have to fight with the information that you don't know yet (in that case, the nes) and the tool that you are not sure how to use properly. 
<br />
<br />A first experiment that you could do is and that is related to your nes emulator is to try to show on the screen character data (I will now call it chr data to make it shorter).  The chr data is encoded in interleaved bit plane so you will have to manipulate every bits to be able to show the picture on the screen.  If your read nestech, you should have all the information regarding the format.  If you don't understand the format, people will be more than happy to help you in the appropriate forum. It may already have been explained in the beginner forum.
<br />
<br />You can take the chr data given with the chr editor called yy-chr, this will give you a reference on what to expect to be shown on the screen.
<br />
<br />From this data, you will have to:
<br />
<br />- Learn how to manipulate bits
<br />- Learn how to read binary data
<br />- Learn how to show that data on the screen with an indexed palette, if possible
<br />- Learn on how to show bit mapped data on the screen in your dev environment
<br />
<br />All those building block that you may find not that fun to do at the beginning will be quite useful later.  And the routines that you will do can be reused in your emulator. So I guess this little practice will be quite valuable later.
<br />
<br />I hope I was not too harsh on you and you have the right to do anything you want but I think that little exercise will help you a lot.  Knowing your tool is quite important, you should not ignore that part.

<br />Using string/shortstring is only for the sake of outputting it into a TMemo to see what I get.
<br />
<br />
<br />What I do to begin with is grab the first few bytes to get NES, which I use Chr() on those bytes to get the actual N E S characters.
<br />
<br />What I am doing could be wrong but the help I was getting seems to indicate i'm doing it right and the output looks good, what do you reckon?
