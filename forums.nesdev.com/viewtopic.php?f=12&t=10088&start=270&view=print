I am still futzing around with hacks, but I have been talking to my friends about putting stuff on carts and we all think it would be really fun to play on actual hardware. Right now I don't have the tools required to do hardware work. INL's boards and programmer looked like an ideal solution, but I will look into the other FLASH alternatives to see if I can get something that will work for us--that is unless there is a way to make the INL boards compatible with the chips.</div><br /> There is no way the infl. Cart can run Mario kart.  That just won't happen.  32 pin ZIF (ZIF is zero insertion socket) sockets are plentiful and cheap.  Even the cheapest programmer can burn 27c080 EPROMs which is what you'd use unless the program grew bigger than 1 megabyte.  This is just an easy way to run your protos.  Of course some of the other flash carts can run DSP games so you may want to consider those.   PowerPak and maybe the everdrive.  These would be a good way to test also.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just don't know, Mark. Making a repro just seems like it takes a lot of technical skills and whenever I had read about people wanting to make them the advice tends to be: don't. I have only ever soldered a few things before (though one of them was a GBA Afterburner front light...), but just from all of the troubleshooting people look like they go through, it just seems like it would be very difficult to try to learn how to get the board, destroy boards learning how to solder, screw up a hundred times with the programmer, etc. INL's boards looked pretty easy. It's not that I am unwilling to learn, but we were searching for a cheap, immediate solution. Even buying a programmer, donor cart, soldering iron, and EPROMs would be more expensive than a flash cart and Kazzo programer.<br /><br /> Maybe we can try hacking games that are just HiROM or LoROM. Most games look like they don't use special chips. I might just end up doing SMW hacks instead for things we will try to put on carts.<br /><br />I was hoping there would be an easier solution that wasn't $150 for an SD2NES, but it looks like not. <br /><br />On the other hand, if I ever decided to make more than 5-10 carts, the programmer would seem like the way to go. I just don't foresee myself needing that many hacked carts at one time, and I don't even know if I would be able to do that hardware modding.

Games that feature software based protections of SRAM or ROM mirroring nature may require a simple patch with a program like UCON64. Games over 32 megabits might be slightly tricky to get programmed due to the arrangement of data, but they do work. <br /><br />So the games left out are the same games left out on most other flash carts and copier machines. No Super FX, SA-1, SDD-1, etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So after all my troubles with my boards and the INL in general, I took a long break from using it out of sheer frustration. Now, coming back, I try to do a simple write to make sure everything was ok. I attempted to do E.V.O and after it wrote I tested it to have Super Mario World on the cart. Thought it was weird and tried Chrono Trigger. Same thing. Super Metroid; same thing. So I thought it wasn't writing or even erasing. After 4 or 5 attempts, I'm getting the error:<br /><br />    [btnEraseClick=&gt;handleEraseThreaded] Erasing cart.<br />    [ThreadStart_Context=&gt;EraseCart] Erasing single-chip SNES Cart.<br />    [EraseCart=&gt;EraseCart] Sending erase header to cart.

Cart may not be inserted or Kazzo may not be ready. Reseat/Reset and try again!<br />    [handleEraseThreaded=&gt;EraseCart_Threaded] Operation time: 10.28 seconds.<br /><br />So I tried redoing the firmware,  using original firmware, re-doing everything, trying different boards, everything I could think of. BOTH my Kazoos won't even recognize there's a board in them anymore.... anyone have any ideas or had something similar happen?<br /><br />(quit edit: yes the board is inserted properly. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> )<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">EDIT: Fixed with a good cleaning</span>

The LED as I recall is supposed to help you know when erasing has completed. To be safe, tell it to erase and then wait atleast 1 minute. Then after that you can try to program another ROM image. <br /><br />Also, what size is your cartridge? 4MB, 8MB, 12MB?

Like I'll update it, the program recognizes the update, then after a few failed attempts it stops working and when I reset it or ask it to find the kazoo, it says  I need to update the firmware again...
