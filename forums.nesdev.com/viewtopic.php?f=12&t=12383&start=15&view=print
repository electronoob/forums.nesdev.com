However, it takes two channels to use, and it has a limited range on how the pitch is affected (up to I believe an octave). Plus, only ADSR and gain values affect the strength of the modulation, not the actual volume.

[...] S-SMP is the SPC700 CPU, which talks to S-DSP.</div><br />...okay, Espozo, my previous explanations should make a lot more sense to you now.  To reiterate - sending data to the audio module requires the S-CPU (the 65816 clone known as a Ricoh 5A22) to send data via the previously-discussed I/O ports to the S-SMP (the souped-up 6502 knockoff known as a Sony SPC700).  The S-SMP shares a single 64 kB RAM pool with the S-DSP, which generates the actual audio and is controlled by the S-SMP.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Espozo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Would the music be possible in a game if there was no compression and you instead used an insanely large cart? I'm probably not going to try something like this, I'm just curious.</div><br />Without compression, the chipless Star Ocean map could hold about a minute and a half of 32 kHz 16-bit stereo PCM, with no space left over for game data.  And the transfer loop would probably still take up a large fraction of the available CPU time.  So no, it's probably still unfeasible, unless you used a bankswitching chip and maybe a coprocessor.<br /><br />If you want to try scaling down the bitrate, well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3SA9LuqQgA" class="postlink">Tales of Phantasia</a> exists (to be clear, only the vocals are streamed).  At that point it's a question of balancing quality with ROM and CPU time.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You know, if sound on the SNES is so flexible, then why do a lot of songs from games like Street Fighter 2 sound a lot different than the arcade version? I'm pretty sure sound on the CPS 1 is FM, but couldn't you have instruments that sound exactly like FM that you can use?</div><br />Theoretically, yes - as long as you can fit what you want to do in the memory you have available.  That Gunforce 2 audio file is 2 MB, or nearly 600 kB in BRR format, so it would have to be cut down judiciously <span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">(or streamed on demand)</span> to work on the SNES.<br /><br />There's also the curious and oft-neglected &quot;pitch modulation&quot; feature, whereby the audio output of a channel (before main channel volume) can be used to modulate the pitch of the next channel.  You may recognize the word &quot;pitch&quot; as a commonly-understood synonym for &quot;frequency&quot; - that's right, the S-DSP is an FM synthesizer.<br /><br />Kinda.  FM synth and SNES pitchmod are conceptually identical, but they're a fair bit different in practice, and using the latter musically is rare, probably because it's not set up to make such use easy.  You can use arbitrary waveforms, but there are no routing options, modulation is limited to +/- one octave, and each operator burns a channel.  And there's no autosync, so you have to align the waveforms yourself.  You can do cool things with it <a href="http://battleofthebits.org/arena/Entry/Ultimate+Chip+Adventure/12045/" class="postlink">if you know what you're doing</a>, but you're probably better off with straight samples for the vast majority of cases.<br /><br />...ah.

I also don't completely trust PCM for interactive music for the same reason: I can just simply program a flag check in music data. PCM is more of a polling-style transition, and even then, it has to be sample exact (and you need more PCM files to account for special effects fading away during these transitions).<br /><br />I think of Packy and Marlon when I think of pitch modulation... even if the results are not quite right. Playground 2 and House 4 come to mind, and Unknown Song 9 and 13 also contains pitch modulation that sticks out.

If you mean reducing the volume, yes.  If you mean keeping the pitch the same while the timbre dulls (like the guitar sample in Gunforce 2), no.  That's a job for either a long sample or an adventure in pitch modulation (you can sharpen the beginning of a sound with pitchmod, then fade out the modulating waveform, but doing this so as to match an existing sample might be quite difficult).  One might have to make a hard decision about how much high-frequency information the sound in question actually needs, so as to pick an optimum sample rate...  I suppose you could use a dynamic sample rate, but that would require you to continually change the playback rate so as to maintain the pitch...<br /><br />The guitar in the audio file you posted contains multiple recorded loops - ie: it's wasting space as it is.  The same is even more true for the long orchestral/choral sample two doors down.  And some of the percussion sounds are longer than they need to be; they could be looped or faded out, with appropriate care, and perhaps some could work with a lower sample rate.  The brass thingy could probably be looped too, with the volume scoop handled in software.  But this is already pushing the limits, and there are the FM instruments to consider.  Doing them with pitchmod would eat too many channels; it's probably better to just use samples for most or all of them.  It might be necessary to sacrifice some aspect of the guitar sample to fit everything in with room for the non-sample data...<br /><br />The sound effects are right out.  That's where all the Neo Geo brute force went.  They'd need either major rework or on-demand streaming, maybe both.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Can you make it to where you can a channel can either use the left, right, or both speakers? Can you also have it to where it works for both, but is a different volume on one?</div><br />Easily.  Each of the eight channels has separate volume controls for left and right, as does the echo.  The volume can even go negative, which gives you phase inversion; this is how games like Vortex do their Dolby Surround.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Why a coprocessor? Is it still the HDMA?</div><br />No, HDMA doesn't take much CPU.  But you can't transfer uncompressed 32 kHz stereo with HDMA because it needs way too much bandwidth.  So the CPU has to spend a lot of time giving the SPC700 a few bytes of data, waiting for an acknowledgement, giving it a few more bytes, etc.  This is not fast.  ~2 kB per frame is nothing for bulk DMA, but this is not bulk DMA.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">(I think a bank switching chip is a bit more &quot;fair&quot; than just completely bypassing the audio hardware.)</div><br />Why?  The BS Satellaview and Super Game Boy did it.
