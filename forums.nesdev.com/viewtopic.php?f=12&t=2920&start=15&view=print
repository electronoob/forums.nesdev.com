Take Apple's Safari browser for instance. They changed things so radically that Konqueror was no longer able to use said patches. Whereas Apple gained monetarilly as a whole from the work of the Konqueror authors. Though they're cool with that, so whatever.<br />Whereas by requesting the changes be sent to me, one by one, I can try and keep up with it and prevent the need to fork projects in the first place. I see some benefits in alternative software (and disadvantages to having <em>too many</em> alternatives, it requires a delicate balance between monoculture and having nobody who can help / support your use of an application), but not in forked software. If one stops going by what gnu.org tells you to think, one would see that it's clearly not at all unreasonable to simply submit a patch to an author for direct inclusion into the main source tree.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This is more an argument against Microsoft's tactics than for BSD software and its effect on monopoly-seeking software companies.</div><br /><br />I think it argues both points. Had Microsoft developed their own internet protocol, BSD and Linux would be forced to emulate it. And we really don't know how ubiquitous it would have become. Maybe it would've killed Microsoft as a company completely, maybe it would've become like NTFS, completely undocumented, with lots of businesses relying on it via MS API abstractions, and only very preliminary, hackish support in Linux / BSD. It's hard to speculate that which didn't happen, but personally I'm quite happy with the end result: you can access all internet services regardless of the OS you use. Now if only the same could be said about those IE-specific webpages ...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Yes, a lot more of this would be welcome in some places.

<br />
<br />Agreed.

<br />This page sounds exactly like what tepples is describing, and what you said is exactly what they are doing. They are trying to change the meaning of terms and define software that doesn't narrowly fit into their opinions on what free is into those offensive terms. And tepples, along with others, seem to be eating it right up.
<br />
<br />Bottom line: "There's no such thing as free software."
<br />The term is contradictory. Everything is a compromise.

<br />OK, I'm granting that you have chosen a license, and other projects have chosen their own licenses. For the majority of users, who just download and run Windows binaries, this is fine.
<br />
<br />
<br />With that covered, do you have any plans to develop an emulator that runs on more modest hardware?

"Either you distribute the software under the GPL, or you have to pay me."</div><br /><br />So the author can basically release free-as-in-user software, and give away that software however they want, for money. And then that company is free to do whatever with it and eventually possibly "lock customers in", and that's ok with the RMS camp? But wanting someone to ask you for the code to get it free of charge is "selfish and greedy"? Odd ... I can see the differences, but the former definitely seems more "greedy" to me personally (though I don't consider doing whatever you want with your software at all greedy to begin with). Well, at least the author retains the right to remove the license later on. I was under the impression using it placed that code under GPL / FSF copyright control, so thusly any future work you did on said project would be a derivation of a GPLed product, and hence the GPL would still apply. I'm guessing this "optionally remove the GPL" clause explicitly states it's only for the original author to use and no one else, cause that would be a pretty blatant oversight for circumvention.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Like or unlike the UNIX philosophy?</div><br /><br />I was really more referring to Win32 and X-Windows GUIs. You can't manipulate a window handle in either if your process doesn't own it. X-Windows goes even farther in that you can't capture keyboard input from other windows by just capturing the global keyboard input. Protecting against keyloggers, but also limiting potential innovative features. There probably is some way to do the keyboard thing, but with Windows it's just GetAsyncKeyState(key). Easy enough that anyone can use it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">With that covered, do you have any plans to develop an emulator that runs on more modest hardware?</div>
<br />
<br />I don't understand the need for such a program. ZSNES already exists. I believe that even if I did everything in my power to optimize bsnes, I couldn't get it more than 50% faster than it already is. And as a result, my codebase would be far less readable and self-documenting than it currently is. Not to mention, it would be quite difficult to perform these optimizations.
<br />
<br />To really optimize things more than 50%, one would have to abandon my emulation approaches and use different techniques such as the "buffered port R/W caches" technique or something. Basically, an entire emulator rewrite would most likely be needed, and no, I really am not up to that task. At least not for SNES emulation :(
<br />
<br />I know it's hard to believe, but for how much bsnes does, and the way it does it, it really isn't all that terribly slow. The CPU&lt;&gt;SMP crosstalk is a good ~15-30 times more precise than SNES9x, and from a technical standpoint, as close as you can possibly get through software. About the only thing I really haven't written efficiently is the IRQ/NMI edge detection because it's so ridiculously intricate and sensitive. To date, I haven't been able to optimize it without breaking the edge cases.
