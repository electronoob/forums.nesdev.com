I can run the published impulse response of the Super NES DSP's interpolator through NumPy to determine its transfer function and then come up with an FIR preemphasis filter to compensate. Should I try this?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, that'd be a neat idea. Keep in mind I just know the basics of signal processing though, so be sure to explain me well your results so I can implement them in the next version of BRRTools.<br /><br />About the playstation &quot;VAG&quot; format, I can't find info exept in the &quot;STR encoding doccument&quot; where it describes it shortly in the FF8 movie format, because FF8 (and other recent Square games, besides) uses normal VAG sound for its videoes instead of more common CD-XA sound.<br /><br />I know the data is similar to BRR but with 28 samples blocks (2 bytes header + 14 bytes data) instead of 16 samples blocks (1 byte header + 8 bytes data).<br />What I don't know is how the 2 bytes header works exactly and what are the filter's coefficients in terms of shifts (you have them in terms of real numbers in the STR doccument but it's not enough for accurate encoding / decoding).

Consider the case where VxPITCH of a channel is 0x1000. Then your sample is played at 32kHz, and because the fractionnal part doesn't change (bits 11-0) then it is as if there were no interpolation, and just a filter is applied to your sample. Assuming an initial phase of 0, your sample is delayed by one sample (z^-1) and is filtered by the equivalent of a two tap low-pass FIR. The equivalent filter does not have a spectral null at fs/2 but it still gets attenuated here. However, if the initial phase is 0x800, then there will be (close to) spectral nulls at fs/2 and fs/4, and the gain between fs/2 and fs/4 will be lower than the DC gain. So, with different phases we get different spectrums. And if the playback rate gets lower, then interpolation kicks in, and we now that the pseudo-gaussian window has a poor roll-off caracteristics and the spectrum gets much less flat than the 32kHz, non-interpolated playback.
