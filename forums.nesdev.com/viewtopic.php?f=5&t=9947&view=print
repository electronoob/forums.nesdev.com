It's just that they threw so many bits to them that you don't know what they're doing anymore. This helped me to see how it works internally.<br /><br />Operations are actually very simple :<br />MULTIPLICATION :<br />Multiply mantissas (after adding an extra '1'), add exponants, xor signs<br /><br />DIVISION :<br />Divide mantissas (after adding an extra '1'), substract exponants, xor signs<br /><br />ADDITION :<br />It's a bit more tricky.<br />You need to look the number with the smaller exponant, and shift it so it match the larger exponant. Then add mantissas.<br /><br />SUBSTRATION :<br />Just change the sign of a number then perform addition<br /><br />CONVERT TO INT :<br />Add extra '1' to mantissa, shift &quot;exponant&quot; times left (right if exponant is negative, throwing bits away). Negate if the number was negative.<br /><br />CONVERT FROM INT :<br />Take absolute value. &quot;Exponant&quot; is equal to the position of the first '1' bit in the int, mantissa is what follows. Match the sign with the original int.<br /><br />Now all this sounds really trivial to me, I don't know why I had the idea it was so complex for all those years. Of course it's more complex as you'll have to check for particular cases, overflow, underflow etc... and multiplication and division is a bit more complex, but the idea is simple.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I read the topic and was like, &quot;huh? too few bits!&quot; but it is possible. How few could you have? Don't need a sign, since &gt;= 0 is still floating-point. Must have expon<strong>e</strong>nt, since that's what &quot;floats&quot; the point. Mantissa isn't strictly needed, since there's always the implied 1 bit. So you could have a one-bit floating-point value, storing 1 or either 0.5 or 2, depending on which direction you have the exponent go.<br /><br />How is zero encoded in your 8-bit FP value?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Normally, zero is encoded as all bits zero (as opposed to, here, 1 * 2^(-4) = 1/6) which is why the minimum is (1+1/16)*(1/16).<br /><br />However I should also have provisions to encode +INF and -INF. In this case, 15.5 would probably means INF (no matter the sign).<br />Nan could be encoded with minus zero.<br /><br />I agree it's too few bits to be useful, calculations where you never risk getting above 15 are rare.<br />Of course the range could be extended by adding bits to exponent, but it would reduce bits for the mantissa and be even less precise.<br /><br />Also the exponant could be &quot;biased&quot;, so that there is either a larger range above 1, or a larger range between 0 and 1, depending on the needs.

Let's code games where velocities are coded in 8-bit floating point <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Not much advantages over 4:4 fixed point though - same range, but more complex calculations. Sure getting exponential precision instead of linear is nice, but is it worth all the overhead ?

If you have lots and lots of objects, and you need more velocity precision than 5:3 fixed, it could save you a byte per object over 8:8 fixed.
