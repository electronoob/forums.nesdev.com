<br />That's the policy I follow on my GBA, which has "MultiBoot" (essentially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_booting" class="postlink">netboot</a> over the serial port) so dumping my own Game Paks to a PC is as easy as hooking up a GBA-to-PC cable. The NES, on the other hand, can't boot over the controller port (yet), and not nearly as many people know how to solder up a CopyNES, so people with a sizable collection of NES Game Paks are more likely to torrent a "GoodNES set" instead of dumping their own. Perhaps a Game Genie with its ROM replaced with <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6941" class="postlink">standardized boot code</a> might help.

My only interest in caring about this is byuu's exclusive use of it in bsnes.

<br />Thanks Dwedit, that was helpful - but what a huge waste of time this was.  I have been trying to run Blargg's nes_cpu_test5.  With your advice, and hours of digging through the bsnes source code I figured that I need to:
<br />1. create a folder named "blargg_nes_cpu_test5.fc"
<br />2. copy the .nes file into said directory
<br />3. chop the 16 byte header off
<br />4. rename the file to "program.rom"
<br />5. create a "manifest.xml" with the following content:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&lt;cartridge&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;board&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;type&gt;NES-NROM-256&lt;/type&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/board&gt;<br />&lt;/cartridge&gt;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />After which, bsnes segfault'd running the program - it fails to load the reset vector from $FFFC.  I think I'm done with this topic.

<br />Edit: <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">My only interest in caring about this is byuu's exclusive use of it in bsnes.<br /></div>
<br />I only just noticed this. I just downloaded bsnes_v088 (32bit compatibility) from the bsnes homepage, and I ran one of blargg's CPU tests in the .NES format just fine. Am I missing something (like you need to do it with a different version of bsnes?), or is all you wanted to accomplish just running this rom in bsnes?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />v088 and earlier allow loading of iNES 1.0 games as .nes files.
<br />
<br />v089 and above will only load images in the FC spec:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Super Mario Bros.fc/<br />* program.rom &#40;Super Mario Bros.nes sans first 16-bytes&#41;<br />* manifest.xml<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;cartridge&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;board type=&quot;NES-NROM-256&quot;/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;mirror mode=&quot;vertical&quot;/&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/cartridge&gt;<br />* save.ram &#40;not for SMB, but for other games.&#41;</div><br /><br />In v088 there is a tool called purify, that when run on the command line, will turn a collection of NES (or ZIP) files into folders, and generate the manifest files for you.<br /><br />By v090, we're hoping to have a launcher so you can associate your .nes/.zip file with it to have it launch in bsnes.<br /><br />I can't call the XML markup spec finalized until I support many more NES mappers, however, so use it now at your own risk.<br /><br />My format is fundamentally incompatible with what FitzRoy was attempting to do, and I don't have support for his spec. He plans to make a derivative fork of bsnes with support for his spec, which I fully support him doing.<br /><br />FitzRoy's spec is:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Super Mario Bros.zip/<br />* prg.mrom<br />* chr.mrom</div>
<br />
<br />With the mapping information pulled from a database found by hashing both ROMs and finding them.
<br />Although this won't work for homebrew, it does neatly avoid my issue of trying to finalize an XML spec that is still changing between releases.
<br />Save RAM, cheats, states, etc are stored elsewhere.

Games licensed by Nintendo would omit the board file; instead, they'd be looked up in the ZapFC database based on hashes of prg and chr. The board file was added in an amendment as a concession to allow unlicensed games, homebrew, and pirate-originals.
