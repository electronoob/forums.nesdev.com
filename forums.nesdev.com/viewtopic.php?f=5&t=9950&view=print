I've grown very sick and tired of companies &quot;bringing back&quot; classics -- leave classics alone, let nostalgia exist in the form of either emulation or playing the original on cart.  So tired of this marketing-driven world, so tired of people not being able to come up with original ideas, so tired of this horrible 3D fad...

They give you Black Tiger for free (one of my personal favourites), and the rest are coming as DLC releases over time. Strider is notably absent from the release schedule, though. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />As far as redoing the DuckTales game. I dunno, I feel the same way about remakes as I feel about any game that is coming up. If it's a good game, great. Most games aren't. So... chances are it won't be, but who knows, maybe they'll do a good job?

It's the one PCB I have loaded into my Candy25 unit all the time.  :-)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID78f2qBmfA" class="postlink">This is for you, rainwarrior...</a><br /><br />I'm still sore at Capcom for never doing Black Dragon for the NES -- I had Capcom game flyers/ads (that came with Capcom NES games) that mentioned they were doing it, but it never came out.<br /><br />Regarding remakes -- as if it's not apparent from my tone of voice, generally speaking I don't approve of them, especially ones that involve turning a classic 2D game into a 3D clusterfuck.  In my experience, 90% (if not more) of remakes turn out to be absolutely awful, and this isn't limited to just Capcom.  While Duck Tales for the NES was a great classic with great music and all sorts of game quirks (in a good way), I feel it should remain exactly that: a classic thing people should remember, or be played how it was originally created.  If Capcom came out with an emulated version of it, that'd be totally cool -- it's the remake crap that gets me really worked up.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not like the originals disappear just because there is a remake.<br /><br />I have nothing against them, and some remakes have been great. A lot of games were made with a vision that they didn't really capture on the hardware of the day. Two of my favorite remakes are Tomb Raider Anniversary and Shadow of the colossus HD. These are two games that were beyond their hardware.<br /><br />While one is a remake, and the other more of a port, I believe both of these games to be superior to their originals. I say this even as a huge fan of the orginal versions of these games.<br /><br />Remakes of games and movies are fine. As long as the original version still exists, I don't see a problem with it. You have a choice wether to play/watch the new one and/or the original one. But then there are crazy people like George Lucas who would rather his original movies were all burned and destroyed. I hate that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, sweet cabinet, koitsu.<br /><br />Myself I worked on a &quot;remake&quot; of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vFj9Wl2Kk8" class="postlink">Yars' Revenge</a> a couple of years ago. The end result bears very little resemblance to the original. Atari didn't even let us include an emulation of the original game with it. I dunno, we worked hard on it, and the result is not worth the $20 they were charging for it, but if it was $5 I'd actually say it's fun to play. Our company was completely falling apart at the time, and more than half the work on the game was unpaid labour. In my opinion we produced really good results, given the conditions we were subject to, but out here in the real world where those conditions don't matter at all it's just an overpriced game that has very little notable about it.<br /><br />Anyhow, my point is that it's generally pretty hard to make a game. The story of Yar's Revenge is not atypical for commercial game development. At least with an unpaid-indie project you can work lovingly on it forever until it's done. When you have to deal with the machinery of the video game industry it's just another pile of factors that can interfere with making something good. At least half of commercial game projects are cancelled before released, and a lot of what does get released is not good. So... my hopes for any particular game, especially cash-in remakes (which tend to go to the lowest-bidder), are generally low.<br /><br />Every once in a while someone makes a pretty decent remake. I thought the Telltale Games Monkey Island / Monkey Island 2 remakes were well done, even though (or because) they add nothing to the original.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Seen the trailer few days ago, and got mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, it is good that the game has not been forgotten. On the other hand, it looks bad. Characters are nice, but the 3D backgrounds are really, really meh. Why they look so undetailed? Why they aren't match stylistically to the characters?<br /><br />I recall the Rocket Knight remake. Had the same feelings before the release, and it turned to be just a bad, boring and uninteresting game in the end, unlike the original. They are basically took out everything that was great about the original (graphics, music, tons of bosses, gameplay variety) and left only the most boring stuff. Difficult to have great expectiations from the Duck Tales remake having this as a recent example.
