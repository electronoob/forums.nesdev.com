It's only taken a couple months or so for it to become second nature to me, and that way there's never any misunderstanding about what my code is doing.  In most cases it's even easier than thinking in decimal:  A standard tile is $10 or 16, so say 17 of them would be $170 or (let me get a calculator).<br /><br />Speaking of you can always use the windows calculator in &quot;Programmer&quot; mode to do conversions and math in hex/binary that you can't do in your head (If you use Windows).

I was originally going to use a word for velocity and a word for the position, and I was going to only take the highest byte from the velocity and add that to the position, as this would allow for &quot;sub pixel precision&quot;, but I later realized that I wouldn't be able to have &quot;negative&quot; velocity, because I couldn't get a 16 space to wrap around using an 8 bit number. Do you have any good ideas as to have both &quot;sub pixel velocity&quot; and &quot;negative velocity&quot;?

There is a workaround involving adding a <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=136626#p136626" class="postlink">bit-reversed version of the current frame number</a> to the low byte of the velocity and then adding the carry from there and the high byte of the velocity to the displacement.<br /><br />I don't see how a two's complement negative velocity would introduce problems.

I know you can use an ADC #$00 on the Hi byte to stuff the carry in there without a branch, at least on the second half, but that seems like it costs more cycles.  Am I missing something or have I got it right?<br /><br />(P.S.   I instinctively put the &quot;beq _doneObjYVelo&quot; at the start to eliminate all the processing when your velocity is zero.  I do that a lot but I suddenly think that's a mistake - since it will speed up processing some of the time but ultimately make the worst-case scenario take slightly longer.  I should refrain from doing that, right?)

I have it to when whenever I set a certain bit to the metasprite routine, it creates a horizontally flipped version of the metasprite, but I wasn't sure how to efficiently make one routine be able to do both, so I literally did this...<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; lda MetaspriteDirection<br />&nbsp; bne backwards_metasprite_loop</div><br />Which means I completely copied the code again except I subtracted the sprites position from the objects instead of adding and I eor'd at one point to change the flip bit. I know there's a better way to do this, and at some point, I want to also have sprites flipped vertically, and that means I'd have to copy the routine 4 times... I know I could look to see if the bit was set to change direction every time I do something that related to the object being flipped, but this would use some more processing time so don't know...

The thing is that the number that is being sbc'd/adc'd is the same, so I cannot really change it. Hey, maybe at the beginning of the code, I could check if the object is backwards, and if it is, I then add #$F000 to the position of the sprite position that gets added to the metasprite position... To make sure it to where it loads either #$0000 or #$F000, I'll make it look at a register that will only ever have those 2 values. (This is the result of if the object is backwards or forwards that gets filled at the beginning of the code.)<br /><br />By the way, what is the opcode &quot;bit&quot; do?
