That remains to be seen until someone decaps the VDP and takes a look.<br />Some arcade boards do use the MD VDP, but with external RAMDAC and utilizing the digital color bus of the VDP to do 8 palettes (4x BG, 4x sprites).<br /><br />As for CPU, 68K jumps far ahead when you do 16 and 32bit operations on it. 32bit ops take very few extra cycles but process lot of data. The CPUs are wildly different though, but the way I see it many tasks that take couple of instructions on 68K need 2...3x more code on the 65x type CPUs, in the end things even out. One is faster on some stuff, other does other things better.

As I said over at NintendoAge, that example is only for pure CPU to CPU without the rest of the system and assumes they are both at the same clock rate. It doesn't take into consideration the large difference in clock rates between the systems nor does it take into consideration system bottlenecks. Best case scenario that bit of code will execute faster on the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>. That's assuming it's well optimized and completely ignores the case of RAM access which has to be done at a slower clock rate of 2.68MHz.  In the worst case scenario with the CPU running at 2.68MHz due to slower ROM (Which was common on the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>), that bit of code executes slower on the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span>.<br /><br />The same person who wrote that bit of code in that Assembler thread had this to say recently over at Sega-16:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tomaitheous wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> is slower than the 68k in the Genesis; that's well known. But it's not slower by 50%. The real speed of the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> cpu floats around ~3mhz (in fast mode. slow mode is strictly 2.68mhz) because of how the 65x architecture puts all the addressing vectors and data registers in zero page (or direct page as term is used on the '816). Instructions are made up of cycles and each cycle that touches main ram (work ram) is wait-stated down to 2.68mhz (rom fetch cycles are 3.58mhz if the rom is fast-rom). And even with the crippling 8bit data bus for the '816, the core of the processor is based on the 65x series which was very fast for instruction cycle times and the expansion to 16bit regs and math really give it a boost (not to mention some nice new instructions). <strong>From my tests, I'd put the performance around 70% of the MD CPU </strong>(disregarding a few advantages each processor has over the other in some cases). </div><br /><br />He later went on to say that the 70% figure is only if your code is insanely well optimized on the <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> side.

And it's not just the CPU that causes problems, it's other bottlenecks in the System. <br /><br />I'm not really biased towards Sega or it's systems. I like Nintendo's systems as well. However it seems there's a certain group of people who love to bash Sega's systems unfairly. When the argument pops up, I tend to defend the Genesis as it seems to get unfairly bashed. My criticizing your argument isn't keeping this thread from being interesting at all.<br /><br />As for not programming, I actually do quite a bit of programming. It's just not in Assembly. I'd love to learn Assembly at some point, it's just finding the time to do it.

And if you truly didn't want me to see this thread, why on earth did you link me to it?<br /><br />You don't have to be a master of assembly however to figure out how long it takes for a clock cycle to happen on a CPU when you know the clock rate. Nor does not knowing assembly prevent you from figuring out from that information how fast a block of code will execute when you know how many clock cycles it will take.<br /><br />This thread is called <span class="posthilit">SNES</span> vs Genesis. But all you seem to be doing here is 68000 vs 65816 while ignoring every other aspect of the systems.
