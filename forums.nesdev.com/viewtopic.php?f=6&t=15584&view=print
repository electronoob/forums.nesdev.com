		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So a dozen of years ago I clearly remember I had donwnloaded a complete collection of NSFs featuring music from most games sorted by company. A few years ago I probably decided it wasn't complete enough and scrapped it, to replace it with another complete collection of NSFs sorted alphabetically. The problem with the second collection (that I have right now) is that many NSFs containts not only music but also sound effects. This is annoying. Also some NSFs such as Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon seems to be bad dumps. So I'd like to have my old collection back, exept I deleted it.<br /><br />Today I cannot seem to find any page for either collection. Does such a thing still exist ? If they have both Battletods games with $4011 drums that'd be amazing but anything else is still good.

It's still on the site here: <a href="http://nesdev.com/nsfcoll.zip" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/nsfcoll.zip</a>, from 17 years ago.  Lots of NSFs had not been ripped by that point in time though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, there are actually a number of people who are unhappy that many original NSFs were ripped without their sound effects, and are reripping /arranging them to include the SFX.  &quot;SFX are an integral part of the game experience / sound code; let's preserve them too&quot; sort of argument.<br /><br />Yes SFX / No SFX will probably never reach a consensus, I think.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I appreciate NSFs having sound effects if possible, and I thought NSFe had a potentially good solution to the problem by adopting a convention:<br /><br />Put all the music tracks in the NSFe playlist, and leave all the sound effects out of it. That way sound effects can be played by turning off the playlist and just listening to all tracks.<br /><br />I think this is suitable because I don't imagine anyone really wants to listen to a &quot;playlist&quot; of sound effects. You're probably either trying to find a specific one to record or something, or just want to listen to them all to investigate what's in there, which also doesn't need a playlist.<br /><br />Of course, we could just add an additional NSFe chunk that identifies which tracks are SFX, and then it could just be a &quot;sound effects&quot; option in the player.

However when the goal is to actually listen to game music, there's nothing more annoying as sound effects being included in the set. Exept if those are part of the music - but NSFs with 100+ &quot;songs&quot;, most of them being sound effects of 3 frame long, are ridiculous and extremely annoying when the goal is to just listen to the music.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The most complete NSF archive you can find is located over here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mrnorbert1994.uw.hu/">http://mrnorbert1994.uw.hu/</a><!-- m --></div><br />Great. Shame that you are in the wrong camp regarding to SFXs. What's the point of having US/JAP/PAL rips when the music is the same ? (I don't mean it in cases where the music is different such as Castlevania games). That's even more worthless than having sound effects.<br /><br />Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon have the same crap as the rip I already had - half of the songs are garbage with tracks playing at wrong tempo (and often at different wrong tempoes). It's great you were able to fix Stage 3's music (triangle's not being time shifted more and more as the time passes) - if Stage 2's who has the same problem would also be fixed that'd be great. I can't believe Rare released the game with such a blatant bug in it, especially given how polished their games are otherwise.
