<br />good. and then you need submappers for carts which have been assigned to wrong mappers, and then you need to properly remap the CHR in a few games like Afterburner, and then... and then...

<br />you can go on fixing mappers over mappers, or simply use an xml layout for the data:

<br />A system-spesific tool (Emulator) is perfectly justified to use a system-spesific format (iNES) so that it can store, read and use the data as effectively as possible when it is known that not much is going to change in the future.

<br />
<br />very true in general [1]. except that in this case iNES gives a poor representation of the content of the cart since it glues together things which should stay separate, like 3 prgs of Action 52 or 2 chrs of Afterburner. or since it fails to document properly corner cases of the pcb wirings (like the variants of mapper 3 used by Sansuu games, or the Konami mappers mixed up in mappers 21-22-26), forcing emu authors to rely on crc checks.
<br />
<br />those are the basic issues that a new format should be address. the xml database used by MESS gives a unified solution to these problems, and I guess the ZapFC database can give all the necessary info too
<br />
<br />
<br />[1] e.g. .sfc is a very good system-specific container for SNES: it fails to document the case of carts with multiple chips (and therefore I still prefer our xml), but at least it can cover all the differences a console can detect between carts, due to the smaller number of hw difference inside snes carts

<br />Now if only the MESS team would quit storing all their Super A'can ROMs WRONG (because some genius decided that the result of dumping Big Endian data on a Little Endian system and thereby byteswapping all the data was somehow "more correct") I could say your emulator is awesome.

<br />
<br />but the data *is* stored in that way inside a cart. they have been dumped and verified. similarly, if you open a megadrive cart and you dump the content you get data in the opposite byte order than most of the currently available roms.
<br />it's the CPU that reads them that way, so we cannot do anything about it.
<br />
<br />if you need to visually check the content of the files, you can byteswap the files with dd or with an hex editor.

You guys are just nuts about some of these things.<br /><br />Yes, some SNES boards have more than one ROM chip. And there are two reasons for this. The first is if your game's size does not need to be a nice power of two. For instance, a 12mbit game is going to be 8mbit+4mbit, in most cases.<br /><br />The second reason is cost. Just like today, the highest capacity memory is often more expensive than two memory sticks that are each half the capacity. Why? People like their free slots and reduced size. And what happens? Costs go down as production ramps up, and even newer, higher capacity chips are made. Eventually, it makes more sense to use bigger chips.<br /><br />So what you find is that many SNES games will use two 8mbit ROM chips initially, and then the next product run, but with identical code, will use one 16mbit ROM chip. And in fact, in some instances you will find say a 12mbit game that uses a 16mbit ROM chip, and simply mirrors the last 4mbit twice to fill the chip!<br /><br />Even with as pedantic and accuracy focused as I am, I can clearly see how ridiculously stupid and pointless it is to split SNES games into multiple files. The data was <em>meant</em> to be linear, and that's how it maps onto the bus.<br /><br />So what does MAME/MESS do with NSS ROMs? It gives them all <em>completely fucking random</em> filenames, so that the only possible way to run an NSS game is to keep an internal database of each and every game. And all for nothing. Merge them together and they run just fine in any emulator. Way to go. Now the two people in the entire world who own NSS hardware and can and will repair it on failure, do not have to spend thirty seconds splitting a file. Meanwhile, the rest of the entire world has trouble playing NSS games in anything but MAME.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">but the data *is* stored in that way inside a cart.</div><br /><br />You should store the data as a series of transistor patterns. You know, if you want to be <em>really</em> accurate.<br /><br />This decision results in poor compressibility of the images for long-term archival, it breaks graphics in sprite editing tools, it makes trying to edit the scripts for English, etc translations far more difficult, and it accomplishes nothing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- I'm out of this discussion.

<br />If only I had a dollar for every post in this thread saying it would be that person's last post, only that turned out not to be the case ... I'd have about $12 now. THE THINGS I WOULD BUY WITH $12 ...

If you want, I'll put together EVERY ROM FOR NES in the EXACT size with separate files with the EXACT binary on the carts if you want, since that is what you want. If you want to preserve ROMS, do it. Just don't try to replace the iNES file which is the way you emulate them! There's a fine line that apparently one other person can see besides me. iNES is for emulation. ZapFC or whatever you make can be for preservation, that's fine. Just don't try to do both with a new format if it isn't what it's intended to do.
<br />
<br />
<br />That is all I will say now. Last post, although I may edit to add things. But right now, next year, and a decade from now, I will be using an iNES based file system with everything inside one file.
