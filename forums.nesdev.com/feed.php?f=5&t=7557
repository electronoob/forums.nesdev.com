I fear the unideal. I know people who have some egos about their work, but are perfectly fine people otherwise. I do not want to be the one to face the beast. Think deviantart drama ego, if you're familiar with that site. Unfortunately I live in fear of people exploding like that. Maybe I'm projecting, and it's me that's the problem, not the world. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />On sites where lots of music is posted, it can get tiring to sift through 90% music you don't like and 10% that's at least OK, so that's where unresponsive audiences come from (8bc is an example).<br /></div><br />I understand in that case, since it's a much larger "market". I'm not saying one should post in every thread giving constructive criticism, just that sometimes silence is not the best option. It's my view that if someone is doing something wrong, and no one says anything about it, they will continue to do it. It's a sliding scale I suppose. Is what they're doing annoying enough to justify saying something? For my friends offering help it doesn't come up often enough to justify it. But for the bootleg threads here? That was coming up fairly often, and I certainly understand the backlash some of them got. <br /><br />I only posted in the other thread when my "scale" tipped because several people had interest, but he was not making it easy to accomplish his own goal. <br /><br />I know some people who say politically incorrect things in some... bad situations. It's usually not annoying enough to say anything, but when it's really bad, you tell the person. Because if no one else does it, they will never think that it might be wrong. Say something in a non condescending tone. But say something. <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />This whole thing saddens me a bit.<br /></div><br />I just get into the habit of making people on forums I frequent like celebrities. "Aw, man. All this stuff they create is amazing!" and when they disappear I had as much contact with them as I've always had, and people can still appreciate their stuff. When Michael Jackson died, Thriller didn't become a worse song. Shame there won't be new stuff, but I never talked to Michael anyway. Very nearly the same with Blargg leaving/hiatusing. I talked to him like once, he seems reasonable. All I really know about him are his contributions, though. I understand those who were in more regular contact with, yet not close enough to get the reasons for his departure, though.<br /><br />Quietust still updates Nintendulator, and bunnyboy still updates powerpak mappers. Maybe blargg will continue to work on things, and post them someplace for us to find. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also why am I posting??? back to lurker mode<br /></div><br />Quite, quite. For me as well. I write too much anyway. <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />My apologies for the inflammatory remarks Kasumi.<br /></div><br />Thank you. I apologize as well. By saying something, you made me feel I did something wrong and reflect on it.

If I did post, in the vast majority of cases of this happening, my posts would read "meh" or "i don't like it" which aren't helpful.

There's been a very limited number of them, and all of them seem to disappear.  The folks I got audio information from for NESTECH are gone, then Brad Taylor appeared (and is now also gone), then there's blargg (who too is gone).  They're in limited supply, so the impact is greater.  And that sucks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Apr 13, 2011 5:01 pm</p><hr />

If someone asks for feedback, and the feedback is "I won't buy this at all," that's fine. If someone asks me, "Do you like the food I made?" I will usually give an honest answer. But I'm not going to tell someone I don't like it, if they don't specifically ask me. <br /><br />I see threads like this on other forums.<br /><br />Poster 1: "Here's a T-shirt design. Will you buy it?"<br />Poster 2: "Looks great."<br />Poster 1: "I don't care if you think it looks great. Does it look great enough for you to <em>buy</em> it?"<br />Poster 2: "Well... no."<br /><br />So. "Don't be a dick." is fine. You can say something someone might consider, "not nice." without being a dick. Did I succeed at not being a dick in the topic you mentioned? Probably not. I tried not to be one though.<br /><br />As for Blargg. It is like when Q(uietust) left. I am sure we will move passed it.

(note, this is not aimed at anyone, just a general rant)<br /><br />I always remember what someone told me a long time ago, and as I get older I see it is more true than ever.<br /><br />Simply, "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything".<br /><br />Sure there may be things I don't really agree with, but generally I will not bring it up since it's not worth the negative vibes, unless it's really egregious somehow.<br /><br />So probably the best thing to do is just ignore threads you don't like, and not bring up the same constant complaints about people trying to make money off NES development.  The simple fact of the matter is almost no one is going to actually make any decent money off it, no matter what they are selling.  And as I get older I also understand how expensive (time wise if nothing else) a pursuit such as writing a game or developing a piece of hardware can be.    If you've never put months or years of your life into something,  you probably won't understand the desire to actually get something back from it, even if it's a token amount.<br /><br />Figure you sell an NES game for $30 and make $10 on it, and sell 500 carts.  That's a cool $5K in profit you can make... but how long did it take to get that game ready?  4-5 months?  If so, that's selling time really cheap.  Obviously you do it for the fun of it instead of the money and that's what it comes down to.  The profit also doesn't account for the time spent making those cartridges either, or the money you had to front to buy those parts and boards and stuff.<br /><br />All the money I have made off NES development of any stripe (yes even the Ciclones and Copynes') was plowed right back into my projects and development.  That money was used to buy an oscilloscope that was then used to figure out the NES' video voltage ranges and some timing information.  Scopes are expensive.  Without the funds generated from my earlier work, I would not be able to perform the later stuff since I wouldn't have been able to afford the scope.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Wed Apr 13, 2011 12:46 pm</p><hr />

"Don't be a Dick" is the best advice a father can give his son, and it's certainly the golden rule of the interwebs.<br /><br />Like that other thread where the guy said he was uncomfortable giving his real name to folks on the forum, and then a few dicks wanted to show off how super-cool they were and find his real name. That's just being a dick, and is not constructive.<br /><br />It's sad that we don't have Blargg around anymore. I was just beginning to realize the importance of his contributions when I realized he was no longer involved.<br /><br />Anyway, the moral of this thread (not Blargg's departure, I'm sure he had better reasons that internet dickbaggery) is to ignore what irritates you. Only put on the fighting gloves when it is something actually important, like a web site selling unlicensed repro's that obviously violate the rights of the creators.

Because one time I pissed him by posting some code and constantly editing it, among other things (Look at my posts from august last year if you really have to see it).<br /></div><br /><br />No.  He and I discussed primarily 3 reasons, and two (well more like 1.5) of those are focused around this forum.  They aren't necessarily focused on individuals.  What I took away from our discussion is that the moderation here need to be improved, or at least refined.  That doesn't equate to "more rules", it equates to "when problems occur, try to get to the root of them and solve the issue" (vs. just banning people).<br /><br />I think the latter relates to what tepples has applied for quite some time, which is basically sticking to what the <a href="http://www.parodius.com/policies/" class="postlink">Parodius Policy Rulebook</a> goes over, with the (IMHO positive) addition of <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1961" class="postlink">don't be a dick</a>.<br /><br />I'm a continual violator of the latter (which is why I come off sounding stern most of the time :-) ), but as I've gotten older (health problems, personal issues, you name it -- real life stuff) I've resorted to the <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/can%27t+be+bothered" class="postlink">I can't be bothered</a> form of thought.  Don't worry, I still rant/rave daily.  ;-)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Wed Apr 13, 2011 12:06 am</p><hr />
