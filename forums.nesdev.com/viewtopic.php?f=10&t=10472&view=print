		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Greetings everyone, first post here. I'm a C programmer on OpenBSD who is making just a little progress in making a game for NES. I have CC65 set up, according to Shiru's tutorial, and I'm able to compile and run .nes binaries with FCEUX. My goal is first to make Towers of Hanoi, and I'd ultimately like to make my answer to the Atari game, Adventure. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />All that said, I need a tool to modify CHR files, and one that will work on BSD. I have tried a couple DOS tools in Dosbox, which certainly didn't seem to work. I'm perfectly able to run a CHR through hexedit and see the really obvious patterns of image data, but I know nothing about the format. (Got further reading?) That gave me the idea of just writing a program to open any binary file, as a hex editor, and display each byte as a color in a 256-color palette. But really, a Gimp plugin might be best for my case.<br /><br />I really appreciate any help, and thank you so much for this site. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

After loading tileset.bmp into xpaint, and then saving it right back and closing it, bmp2chr is unable to load tileset.bmp. I have a strong feeling it has to do with the image editor changing the pixel format. However, in Gimp, even if I change the image to Indexed and set the colormap to 0x000000,0xffffff,0xff0000,0x0000ff for CHR storage, the problem is the same. Bmp2chr will not load it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Got it! I'm sure you all knew this before I did, but I'd like to write here for posterity.<br /><br />When using Gimp with Bob Rost's NES Sprite Tools, you have the option to not overwrite the color space. This is easy to miss. It falls under &quot;Compatibility Options&quot;, so look for that when trying to export. If you do not select this option when exporting to BMP, the BMP will not work with bmp2chr. (This was my problem.)<br /><br />The BMP you wish to convert to a CHR must be 24bpp with only 4 colors. These are 0x000000, 0xffffff, 0xff0000, and 0x0000ff.<br /><br />While it's better to create your artwork in an indexed mode with 4 colors per sprite of your choosing, when you export to BMP, you must switch the colormap to the above colors. Then, change the image to RGB 24bpp mode, and then export -- without overwriting the color space.<br /><br />So, it's probably a good idea to keep these palettes around when working with Gimp or another tool of your choice.
