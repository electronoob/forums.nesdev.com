I am currently making a hack of the FDS SMB1 where is matches SMB2J in everything, including physics.<br /><br />This is what has been done:<br /><br />1. Fixed Minus World glitch<br />2. Got timer routine to count down on X-4 stages<br />3. Added skid sound from SMB2J<br />4. Jump physics match SMB2J<br />5. Graphics match SMB2J<br /><br />I only need help with making it a one player game and adding fireworks routine from SMB2J.<br />I have found an smb1 .ips patch for the NES that does a jsr mod to make it a one player game. When porting the code to the FDS through hex editing, the FDS version is $20 less than the NES, so I successfully added it to FDS but something is still not right. I am now learning assembly and this is above my skill. <br /><br />I will pay anyone $20 USD through Paypal if they are able to make this a 1 player game and add fireworks routine frm SmB2J. As mentioned, these are the only two thing needed to complete this upgrade.<br /><br />Please, only PM me if you are serious about doing this and know ASM well enough. We will work through ips patches, and I will send you the patch of my current hack. <br /><br />I have checked with the administrator and this topic is not breaking any Forum rules, so please do not complain about this topic. Thank you  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> .<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5262">ShaneM</a> â€” Wed Jan 23, 2013 3:28 pm</p><hr />
