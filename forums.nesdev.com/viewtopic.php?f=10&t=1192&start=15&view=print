It's true of F*ROM, U*ROM, and S*ROM, but not NROM, CNROM, or CPROM, which have only a single fixed 32 KB bank. (Most generally, you usually want reset, NMI, and IRQ in a fixed bank.) For instance, the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> has reset=$8000 and NMI=$8082. It appears the OP is using NROM:<br /><div class="quotetitle">No Carrier wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Now that I have a few NROM devcarts</div>

<br />
<br />For bankswitching programs yeah, but I'm sure anyone who's just coding for testing will find NROM to be more than enough (until a ton of data comes into the picture).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just don't do it period. I always have the reset vectors and stuff in the same bank as the vector adresses. It's safer to do it that way, in my opinion. I'm sure it will work if you don't, but if you're bankswitching, you most likely want to put it in $C000-$FFFF, because you will be able to reset at any time because you'll always have it in $C000-$FFFF. Okay, this next sentence may require you to read it multiple times, because it is long. 
<br />
<br />If you have it in $8000-$BFFF, and you are in a bank that doesn't include your reset routine, and you do a soft reset, the vector addresses in $FFFA-$FFFF will jump to $xxxx (the reset address), but it will jump to that address in the wrong bank, so it will be a catastrophe.. Or do the banks go back to what they started as at soft reset?
<br />
<br />P.S, let me know if you have no idea what I'm talking about.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's just that I never heard of it beeing a forbiden thing. I always knew you could screw up if switching banks the vectors pointed to, but if you're carefull you can just have copies of these routines in all banks.
<br />
<br />Now, i'm not discussing what is more practical, usable, compact, better or any of that. The thing is that, apparently, you <strong>can</strong> set the vectors to whatever you want (even point to RAM) but you must be carefull and have code prepared at the correct locations all the time. I got confused when you said it was forbiden, as I had never heard of such a thing.
<br />
<br />The actual comment should be: "If you're starting to work with bankswitching, you <strong>should</strong> have all the vector point to a hardwired bank".
<br />
<br />'Cause you know, there are useful things you could do with the NMI in switchable banks. Maybe your game has many different types of levels, and you have different engines for each one of them. In this case, it would be useful to have different NMI routines in the ROM that you'd like to switch in according to the level.
<br />
<br />You can't just say "it won't play", period. That's misleading.

<br />You could even point to the PPU registers, the APU registers or whatever, but the result won't be very usefull.........
