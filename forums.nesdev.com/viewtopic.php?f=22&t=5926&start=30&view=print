<br />
<br />Main thing that annoys me is the cursor moving down after I flip a second card. I realize this is to get out of the way so I can see them, but it's bothersome to my subconscious positioning. I'll be going through flipping cards at the beginning, and have to keep moving the cursor up to compensate. Can the cursor's top just move to the lower-right corner of the cell during that time? More internal state, I realize.
<br />
<br />I do find it fun that I can move the cursor while the opponent isn't, and he'll just move it back where he wants it.

<br />When I work on my laptop I always backup (online or to a flash drive) each session's work, because I know I'll have a hard time getting the data back in case anything bad happens (even if the HD doesn't fry, as I have no idea how remove and read laptop HDs).
<br />
<br />Anyway, good luck recovering from this shitty event.

I just haven't been religious enough about it to automate it to the point where I can plug in a drive, push a button, play some NES, and come back to "backup complete". That's my next project.
<br />
<br />One thing I learned: Don't run distributed computing projects like World Community Grid's Nutritious Rice for the World on a netbook, even while you have it plugged in. It will wear out the fan.
