		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm having trouble with the math.<br /><br />If I did some kind of APU IRQ, what's the fastest rate I could get? And, yes, I know there would be a ton of overhead in the IRQ handler, making this difficult to calculate. Rough estimate? Anyone?<br /><br />I know MMC3 scan line counters are NOT really useful below 2 scanlines, and that's not fast enough (7000 hz) for what I had in mind (PCM audio).

You would need to play a sample of 10101010, which would add a slight noise to the playback as well. So DMC irq probably wouldn't work for what you're looking for.

Then I quickly realized the PIC MCU I used could do everything even better, ended up with NES just getting IRQ to write the PIC's generated data to $4011.<br /><br />Another reason MMC3 wouldn't be useful for this, is that the IRQs stop coming during vblank.

Can you get a ~500 cycle delay in this case?<br /><br />i.e. when using the PCM IRQ would it be prudent to use OAMDATA instead of DMA?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I remember being concerned that OAM DMA would ruin the audio, but when I enabled it, it seemed pretty much unnoticeable to me.  But that was 10+ years ago on a project where I was excited that it even worked at all (being my first hardware), so it could be a case of rose-tinted glasses (er, earphones?).  I'm seriously tempted to revive my old code and find out sometime. I'd expect to hear some kind of combination of a 60hz buzz and aliasing, getting worse as the frequency gets higher.<br /><br />I wonder how much worse the OAM DMA's effect would be when the NES is doing the synthesis, because those cycles are just gone.  In Squeedo's case the PIC runs independently, the NES misses out on a few updates, the audio isn't permanently distorted.
