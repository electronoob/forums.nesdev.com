I'm doing what Memblers (I think) said, have one socket soldered to the board and another with the chip, and then the sockets are the ones connected and disconnected all the time, and nothing important gets damaged.<br /></div><br /><br />It is much easier to solder a socket it its place. However, be careful of what type of socket you choose. ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) sockets are much more bulky, but if you aren't going to try to put a case on the cart - it shouldn't matter. I used them in my NROM and CNROM carts. Regular sockets are much thinner, and take up less room on the cart itself. However, you need to be VERY careful when removing ROM's from the regular sockets, because you can easily bend/break the pins.<br /><br />Here are some pictures:<br /><br />ZIF socket (32 pin):<br /><br /><img src="http://www.futurlec.com/Pictures/ZIFU32.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Regular IC socket (32 pin):<br /><br /><img src="http://www.eleparts.co.kr/imall/item_images/355.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />For the ZIF socket, you simply place the ROM inside, then flip the little handle and it locks on. With the regular IC socket, the ROM "snaps" in place, and can be hard to get out. I use one of these to remove it now, and it works wonders:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.arieselec.com/Web_Data_Sheets/22003/22003a11.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />That is a simple DIP extractor. It looks cheap and simple, but I couldn't live without it. You can place equal pressure on each of the ROM (lengthwise), and easily pull it out without breaking any pins.<br /><br />Hope that helps,<br /><br />NC<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=265">No Carrier</a> — Fri Mar 24, 2006 2:33 pm</p><hr />

I didn't get any board working, sadly. I've attempted like 3 times, and none of the times worked. I was using my old crappy code though, so it might have been that. But what you might want to do alot is when the tip of your soldering iron turns all black and crusty, you want to sand with sandpaper, so you can get all that crap off. Whenever I try and tin my iron, the rosin seperates from the alloy, and burns on to the tip, and the alloy balls up and just slides off my iron. So I just don't even try, and I sand off what gets burned on the iron when I'm soldering. It works, so don't worry, I'm not like killing my iron.<br /><br />It's a little tricky to get the EPROM in the socket, or whatever you're using. I should really get some standoffs, or whatever they're called. The slots for sticking chips in, so you can just stick it in, and pull it out, you know? For quick and easy chip switching. You solder them into your board, and you just stick chips in them. They seem REALLY handy. I need to buy some more EPROMS. Unfortunately, I bought a Willem with USB power only, but I was told it would work with all chips it said it was compatible with. Obviously it should be, but some people here were saying it wouldn't, a while back.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Mar 23, 2006 9:13 pm</p><hr />

It is possible to desolder them. Take the tip of the soldering iron, and touch it to the solder. Then take your desoldering device, and remove the solder when it's hot. I'd reccomend a desoldering pump, or something along the lines of an eyedropper type of device. With mine, you push down on this button, and when your ready to have it suck the solder up, press another button, and it will well, suck it up. I didn't think it'd work, but it did. Desoldering can be a bitch, I will admit. Beware... In every desoldering project, there is ALWAYS one pin that is such a bitch, and so hard to desolder. I call it the bitch pin. <br /><br />It could be any pin on any chip, but it will give you such a hard time, and it will take like 1 hour to desolder. I personally have never had any of my NROM devcarts work on a real NES.

Yeah, I ordered the programmer, it hasn't arrived yet. I'd like to speed things up by preparing whatever I can before it gets here, so I decided I'd take the ROMs from a NROM cart off. But... how the hell am I supposed to take them off? The pins are so small and all, is it really possible to desolder them? I can barely make contact between the soldering iron and the thing... I read once someone cut all the pins and then desoldered them, but that would mean ruining the game that's in there, right? So, how should I go about removing the ROMs?
