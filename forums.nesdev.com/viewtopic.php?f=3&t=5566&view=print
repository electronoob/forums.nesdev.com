		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I seem to have yet another problem with the 'open bus' thing. I was able to solve my <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=5482" class="postlink">last problem</a> in a sort of round about way, but that was just the program counter and getting the opcode but now I'm dealing with assignment to a register. Now I have another problem with open bus and it's with the LDA ($NUM, X) command inside nestest.nes
<br />
<br />A snippet of that section in the FCEUX log. Problem Line is on $CFF2 and $CFF4
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">$CFEA:A1 80&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA &#40;$80,X&#41; @ $0303 = #$5C A:5B X:03 Y:69 P:nvubdIzC<br />$CFEC:C9 5C&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CMP #$5C&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:5C X:03 Y:69 P:nvubdIzC<br />$CFEE:D0 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BNE $D000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A:5C X:03 Y:69 P:nvubdIZC<br />$CFF0:A2 00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDX #$00&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:5C X:03 Y:69 P:nvubdIZC<br />$CFF2:A1 FF&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDA &#40;$FF,X&#41; @ $C600 = #$20 A:5C X:00 Y:69 P:nvubdIZC<br />$CFF4:C9 5D&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CMP #$5D&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:5D X:00 Y:69 P:nvubdIzC<br />$CFF6:D0 08&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BNE $D000&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A:5D X:00 Y:69 P:nvubdIZC<br />$CFF8:A2 81&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LDX #$81&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A:5D X:00 Y:69 P:nvubdIZC</div><br /><br />It tried to access $C600 which I know shouldn't be accessed like that so I would think it's using the open bus thingy, but there's no indication of a $5D being used anywhere except after the LDA! And I'm sure the CMP has no effect. Where'd that $5D come from and why? Maybe it's not open bus like I thought? <br /><br />I tried to test it by trying to duplicate it in a test rom of sorts of my own.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #$00<br />&nbsp;STA $00FF<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;LDA #$C6<br />&nbsp;STA $0100<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;LDA #$5C&nbsp; &nbsp; ; just in case<br />&nbsp;LDA &#91;$FF, X&#93;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;CMP #$5D</div><br /><br />$C600 has the value $FF and the Accumulator comes out zero <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />Different Address but same value as FCEUX log:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">LDA #$27<br />&nbsp;STA $00FF<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;LDA #$C0<br />&nbsp;STA $0100<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;LDA #$5C<br />&nbsp;LDY #$20<br />&nbsp;LDA &#91;$FF, X&#93;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;CMP #$5D</div>
<br />
<br />Accumulator comes out as $FF. 
<br />
<br />So I'm thinking that maybe the value in the address has an effect(or it could be the address itself, I dunno) but I have no idea why.
<br />
<br />So just what is the method for dealing with this type of thing?
<br />
<br />Thank you for your time <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think that is open bus. Open bus is when you try to read an address that is not implemented for reading, like some of the PPU regs, or the APU regs, or any address beyond those that are not mapped by the game cartridge itself, like 0x5000 and above up to 0x7FFF. The address $C600 should be mapped however, since that is the prg rom. Since nestest has 1 bank 0xC000 to 0xFFFF is mirrored with 0x8000 to 0xBFFF. The indirect x reads in a pointer way, where it gets the value next from the opcode,in this case 0xFF. then adds x to it (wrapping around, since whatever happens in zero page stays in zero page), then it reads the low and high address to get the real address to read from. Since the pointer can change, the cmp could have an effect, where maybe it is used for some timing purposes to keep bne in a loop. For real open bus addresses, I just returned whatever is read last on the bus, like address lda $5000 would be 0x50, since the last value read is 0x50. Though the PPU open bus is handled a little differently, search for dvdmth posts about open bus and the PPU, where he explains it really thoroughly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for replies!
<br />
<br />I'm not sure about the wrap around because right before the LDA at $CFF2 the value in $0000 is $04. It's not reading from $04000 though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />But the value in $0100 is $C6 making it indeed get the address $C600
<br />
<br />So I still unfortunately have no idea how the $5D came about <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Also how am I supposed to implement data bus emulation? I don't have my source code right now, but I guess my implementation is a little different cause I'm not dealing with the data bus whatsoever....
<br />
<br />But basically it's like this
<br />
<br />LDA IMMEDIATE
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&#41; Find the address to operate on from the Address Mode<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2&#41; Get the Value from that Memory location and place into Accumulator<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&#41; Check Zero Flag<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4&#41; Check Negative Flag<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5&#41; Up the Program_Counter<br />&nbsp;<br /></div>
<br />
<br />No dealing with the data bus or anything fancy shmancy. Just get the address, get the value, store value, check flags, point to next instruction
<br />
<br />Is there anything wrong with that method?

<br />That's wrong, it should read from $400. All zero page instruction, be them lda $xx,X or lda [$xx,X], or even lda [$ff],Y, wrap arround in zero page and will never use anything from the stack page no matter the values of X/Y.

Though I think fceux has a good cpu emulation, last I tested it out, it passes all the cpu instruction tests except for like 2 unofficial opcode, if there was a bug in the debugger, it probably is a bad parsing or something, instead of bad cpu emulation.

<br />
<br />The main problem is that the Name Table isn't getting loaded properly for some reason. It's the only graphics implementation I have right now, but I have tested it with my own test rom and used graphics from Donkey Kong title screen and my background graphics emulation seems to work so I'm under the impression that the problem is with the CPU somewhere. But I have no idea where. All I get is a blank screen.
<br />
<br />There WAS this one time where I got SOME of the Balloon Fight title screen to come up(The title options showed up but not the logo and there was lots of 'junk' around), but ever since I changed all my 'char's to 'unsigned char'(cause I just found out they should be unsigned) All I get is a blank screen.

<br />
<br />Now that I think of it, vast majority of my problems with this emulator comes from instructions not working properly cause something needed to be signed or unsigned <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> It's driving me nuts!
<br />
<br />I probably unsigned some variables that shouldn't be unsigned. I guess I'll have to check through then.

<br />Title screens come up but no demo modes. I haven't implemented some things yet, like the sprites or controls so hopefully that's it.
<br />
<br />In Balloon fight the title's only up for like half second and then just a black screen. 
<br />
<br />Then there's Donkey Kong which just hangs on the title screen! Same with Joust.
