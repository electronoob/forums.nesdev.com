		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So I'm new to NesDev and 6502.  I'm doing the Nintendo Age tutorial right now and the author, bunnyboy, recommended downloading Tile Molester.  I downloaded v.16 and clicked on the Executable Jar File.  It starts to run, but then I get an error ---&gt;  "No language files found.  Please check your installation".  I tried to download v.15, both binary and source, but it said something about windows denied the opening of those files.  Hopefully this is enough information...if not, I will answer questions.  Thanks.
<br />
<br />Here's the lesson I'm on right now:

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks Kasumi.  I went ahead and downloaded the NES screen tool along with Nestopia last night.  I also downloaded a Ninja Gaiden .nes file in order to use on NES screen tool, but then got sidetracked with playing it on Nestopia until 5:30am...haha.  I'll be able to pick up my Nintendo Age tutorial lesson later on today.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />3gengames is right, you won't be able to use a generic tool to edit screens in ROMs. That's because each game has its own way of storing screens/maps/whatever. If you want to modify a game you have to reverse engineer the format it uses and hack that.

Large characters like Mario are made from multiple 8x8 tiles. All the backgrounds are also made from these tiles. The tile system means less memory is needed (was expensive at the time) but also means that things like bitmap pictures and 3d graphics aren't really possible. To see all the tiles in a game, download Tile Molester and open up your .NES file. Scroll down until you see graphics that don't look like static. You can see that small tiles are arranged by the game to make large images.</div>

<br />This is what the Nintendo Age Lesson asks me to do.  I posted the link at the top for the lesson if you want to know more.  Should I just skip this part or what?

<br />I did my research and found Ninja Gaiden uses CHR-ROM because of the cinema scenes.  I loaded the .nes file into the YY-CHR tile editor and confirmed that it's just a bunch of static.  Is there an NES game I should get that would help me to better see the tiles in YY-CHR?

<br />Moving on to Nintendo Age Lesson 3!

"cinema scenes" can be done with either ROM or RAM, the game it's self give absolutely no clue weather it uses ROM or RAM. Look the game up on here to see what it uses and just find a game that uses CHR-ROM. Something like Mario Bros. 1/2/3 all use CHR-ROM, try those.

<br />And it should take you to the characters in YY-Chr, but if not scroll to them with the arrows, they will be in there.
