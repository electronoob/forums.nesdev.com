		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The noun &quot;American&quot; is an awkward word.  It attempts to cover too much (lacks granularity).  By definition, it can refer to someone who was born, or actively resides in, North America or South America.  Also by definition, it can refer to someone who was born, or actively resides in, the United States.<br /><br />This is compounded by fact that the noun &quot;America&quot; (singular) is multipurpose and just as awkward: it refers either to any of the Americas (North, Central, South), or refers to the United States specifically (see below for colloquial usage).  The number of times I've witnessed people (already in heated discussions) nitpicking over use of this word is astronomical.<br /><br />In my experience (as someone from the United States) that many of us here in the States forget that North America, as Bregalad mentioned, includes both Canada and Mexico.  Canadians seem to be more aware of this fact and use the terms correctly (better education?  Better grasp of geography?  Unsure); they also use the term &quot;American&quot; to refer folks in/from the United States.<br /><br />In American English, we don't really have a term that *exclusively* refers to people from the United States.  The closest we've got is &quot;American&quot;.  The irony is that many folks born in the United States forget that the word encapsulates more than just the country they live in.  In turn, you have to go off of context, and/or ask questions (&quot;Wait, by 'American' did you mean folks from the Americas or just the United States?&quot;).<br /><br />TL;DR -- the terms American and America require one key off of context, and often add strain/stress during conversations that are already volatile (esp. if involving politics).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ask any canadian if they're &quot;american&quot; and they'll tell you no. Generally speaking, &quot;american&quot; is <em>not</em> used to refer to people from any part of the Americas. It only refers to the United States of America, in any English context I'm aware of. This isn't a usage limited to the USA.<br /><br />The two main exceptions I can think of are historical contexts that predate the existance of the USA (e.g. discussion of Columbus' exploration), and of course people pointing out that &quot;technically American means anyone from both continents&quot;.<br /><br />The default usage is just to refer to the USA, and unless you've prepared a context that makes it clear you're using it the other way, you will be misleading people (i.e. using it wrong). If someone asks you whether you're &quot;american&quot;, they normally want to know if you're Usanian<sup>*</sup>.<br /><br />The meanings of words change over time. The fact that the word has &quot;america&quot; in it is merely a historical consequence (etymology). Just because that's where the word came from doesn't mean it hasn't changed since. The nitpicking about this meaning is just something for people to say when they're bored.<br /><br /><br /><sub>* I made this word up, it is not valid.</sub>
