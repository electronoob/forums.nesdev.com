As others have said, ice and sludge rqeuire a more complex physics system.  ReaperSMS pretty much got it.<br /><br />Every frame, you add velocity (which may be negative) to the player's x and y values.  Also, every frame you add acceleration (which may be negative) to the player's velocity values.  Acceleration needs to be a force that acts to move the player downwards (y axis gravity) and a force that varies based on current velocity to slowly stop the player's movement (x axis friction).  Jumping temporarily sets y velocity to a high number which will slowly be decremented by gravity.  Moving left or right modifies x acceleration and counteracts friction (or ignores it altogether).<br /><br />You have a different maximum <em>velocity</em> based on how quickly you want the player to move, so while on the ground and in sludge this value would change.  You have a different <em>acceleration</em> based on how quickly you want the player to speed up to that maximum velocity, so while on the ground and on ice this value would be very small.  When no direction is being pressed, friction would also be low as well (meaning the rate that velocity is moved towards 0).<br /><br />As for the other topic in this thread...I hate talking about people as if they weren't there.  I hope the discussion doesn't bother you too much Sivak.  These forums are a free source of information and I'm really glad for that, that any of us can use the information we find however we want.  Personally I'd really love to know more about how your games are put together, I asked before and didn't get a lot of info.  But I understand that people can be busy or not forthcoming for various reasons, sometimes it's hard to explain how you did things.  Some short blog entries or a developer diary of some sort would be of great interest to me, if you'd be willing.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Thu Mar 11, 2010 5:56 am</p><hr />

No need to fight over this, guys. Fortunately we live in a world that's free enough for both of them to exist: this place is open to everyone, so Sivak can ask whatever he wants regardless of his intentions, and nobody is forced to answer, so Bragalad can abstain from helping.

Not sure if you realize this but ANYONE can read ALL of the information here, and use it for ANY REASON they want.  Even if you ask posters if they plan on profiting first (which you don't) someone else could come along later and steal your brilliant ideas.  <br /><br />Say tokumaru asks that exact same question, looking for advice.  You help him because you think he won't make money.  Then someone else a year later reads the thread and makes a game using your idea.  If that game is never released was your time wasted?  What happens when the game is given out free but you aren't thanked?  If that game is sold are you then suddenly being ripped off?  You have lost absolutely nothing in all cases, but somehow money changes how you feel even though you have no plans to capitalize on it.<br /><br />It's just your hobby, so you spend a couple minutes answering a question.  No code, just a quick idea like acceleration.  Then Sivak takes that idea and works for many months to make a game.  How is that exploiting you?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=228">bunnyboy</a> — Wed Mar 10, 2010 9:12 am</p><hr />

That should be inspiring to many. I'm not wild on the closed nature of it, but hell, show me others here who are open about everything <em>and</em> have been able to pull off publishing. For all I know, the two don't really go together, for whatever reason. Until we have tens of people here like that, I don't think it's a problem.

I don't think anyone will ever be able to feed his family by programing NES games again, Neil Baldwin is the only one here would knowns what this is, anyone else mentioning it will just make me laugh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Mar 10, 2010 6:27 am</p><hr />

I don't know how well this would work, let alone if it would, but avoiding subpixels and going strictly with counters, one could have a set count down before moving in a particular direction, then, when the person stops, this same delay can be repeated, unless the person jumps or walks against the counter. The jump would reset the delay to 0, unless the fall makes contact with the ice, and moving in the opposite direction would simply make the delay counter expire faster.<br /><br />To accomodate for small movements in opposite direction (when lining up a jump or simply to stop) the delay would need to check for a direction change and null if the full delay isn't met when going the opposite direction(this could open up a possibility for quicksand that doesn't allow movement unless the delay is longer, then the influence on movement could be reduced, etc).<br /><br />Please ask if something confuses you, I get that a lot.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=26">AWal</a> — Wed Mar 10, 2010 3:08 am</p><hr />
