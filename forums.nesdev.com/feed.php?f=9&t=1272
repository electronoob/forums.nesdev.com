This isn't a code, but a glitch in the game. The programmers most probably didn't want that to happen, but it happens.<br />When you use the command "Item-W", it allows you to use 2 items. You have to pick up the first, then the second. If you're selecting the same item both times, it's amount won't decrease the second time. Then, if you cancel, it's amount will still increase. Repeat this to get 99 Elixirs, 99 Mega-elixirs, 99 shelters, etc...<br /><br />It's a bit like in FF2 when you select "attack", choose a target and cancel, and  repeaat this many times, your weapon's level will go surprisingly up, because  for some reason the game think you actually attacked all these times.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Mar 26, 2006 1:39 am</p><hr />

Yes, I forget what it unlocks, though. Doesn't he have extra materia or something like that when you do that? But some of the cheats won't be available. Like I forget what you do, but it involves the X-Item materia and the elixir, and you can make 99 elixirs. There will be none of that, I don't have time to make code that will allow people to make infinite elixirs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2006 4:00 pm</p><hr />

There are a lot of name confusion along the series, such as Lydia/Rydia, Butz/Bartz, Lenna/Reina, X-Death/Exdeath, Tina/Terra, Cefka/Kefka, Clad/Cloud, Aerith/Aeris, Xell/Zell, Djidane/Zidane, etc...<br />I don't think one more will relly be care.

I could do multiple-letter tiles, but I also don't think it'd look too good. But Sephiroth will be reffered to as Sephiroth through the game, but in menu/battle, his name will be Sefroth. Remember like FF4, where they had Leviatan, and his name as a summon was Levia? Yeah, it'll be like that, but in menu/battle, Sephiroth will be Sefroth. You won't be able to name Sephiroth, so it won't matter. I'm very excited to see how this will all turn out, I hope it rocks, and doesn't fall apart along the way of developement.<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, I forgot, Bregalad. I for some reason always make a typo when typing "Barrett", I always type "Barrette". I don't know why, it's just a typo though, not how I'm actually going to name him.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2006 2:29 pm</p><hr />

That's true, I forgot. You're adding a "e" to Barett ? Barette, it really sound like a girl.<br />You're limiting to 7 letters ? If so, you'll have to limit everywhere, not only in the menu. Alternatives like CatSith isn't too noticable. But Sephrot is.<br />Sephi, or Sefiroth maybe ?<br />Else, do as tepples does, but I'm afraid it won't look very good. It works fine for il, li, ll, but not for other letters.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2006 1:52 pm</p><hr />

You are correct about that. Isn't it funny how obvious some things are about how they programmed? Like, exactly 256 enemies, that's really funny. And I think there were about the same amount of weapons/armor/items too. You also forget (Though it is not a big deal,) That you will be able to name the characters, and you'll have their names stored in RAM, too. That'll be about 70 bytes, 7 bytes per name. There's Tifa, Cloud, Yuffie, RedXIII, Sephiroth(Will be Sefroth for menu screen), Barrette, Aeris, Vincent, CaitSith(Will be CatSith for menu), and Cid. But it will be in the "QuickStats" array which contains what will be shown when the menu opens (Name, Level, HP/MP). I still have to show the Limit/EXP levels I suppose. But for now I just have those shown.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2006 12:41 pm</p><hr />

Well, you also forget that there are many materia, AND I have to define if they are linked with another materia. So that causes a little more complications with that type of stuff. And possessed items would be different. It'd be more like 512 bytes, because I have to know how many are in stock. So 1 byte for each item, and 1 byte for how many are in stock. Things like this make me take up more SRAM. And the quest bits, if there's 2048 quest bits, then that's alot of comparing, and that'd take up alot of PRG space.

Okay, I assume you're talking about FF7.<br />That would do a such SRAM chart for each saved game and the current game :<br /><br />Possesed items : <strong>256 bytes</strong><br />Possesed Blue Magic : 24 bits -&gt; <strong>3 bytes</strong><br />Possesed materia : <strong>256 bytes</strong><br />Equipped items : 3 slots and 8 characters -&gt; <strong>24 bytes</strong><br />Equipped materia : 16 slots and 8 characters -&gt; <strong>128 bytes</strong><br />Status : (13 ?) different stats and 8 characters -&gt; <strong>104 bytes</strong><br />Party's characters -&gt; 8 bits (one per character) -&gt; <strong>1 byte</strong><br />Pary order : 3 slots, and 8 characters make 3 bit per characters -&gt; 9 bits -&gt; <strong>2 bytes</strong><br />Limite gauge fulness : 1 byte per character -&gt; <strong>8 bytes</strong><br />Limit activated : 7 limits, 8 characters -&gt; <strong>8 bytes</strong><br />Limit level activated : 4 levels -&gt; 2 bit per character and 8 characters -&gt; 16 bits -&gt; <strong>2 bytes</strong><br />Configuration : Should be hold in a <strong>single byte</strong><br />Gil : Up to 999'999 gils mean <strong>3 bytes</strong><br />Time : Seconds, Minutes, Hours, made <strong>3 bytes</strong><br />Location : One byte is enough when using save points. I think more are needed on the world map. Let's say <strong>4 bytes</strong>.<br />Quest bits -&gt; About treasure chest, game events, optionnal and non-optionnal bosses, chocobo breeding, etc... each thing should have its bit to set if the player had it or not. So, for a game like FF7 it needs, I think, about <strong>512 bytes</strong> (2048 quest bits)<br /><br /><br />This makes an overall 1315 bytes, 523 in hex. So, let's admit it fills $600 bytes. This allow you up to three save games, and the current game data, and 4 times $600 does $1800, 3 quarters of your SRAM chips. This leaves $800 for other use, such as game engine. I think it is do-able with 8kb.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2006 1:25 am</p><hr />

With two chips, only 8kb is battery backed.<br /><br />However, that would need create a new board and your game will only run in emulators that could support this (so, in other words, only in emulators of people that knows you and your projects).<br /><br />If you want to keep in the "official" boardtypes, do one of the following :<br />- Reconsider limiting you to 8kb (I'd recommand this one actually)<br />- Use SOROM (but this limits you to 256kb of PRG)<br />- Buy a very expensive FF1&amp;2 japaneese card, open it and so you'll be able to officially reconize it board, allowing you to 512kb PRG and 16kb SRAM on the same cart)<br />- Use the MMC5<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Mar 25, 2006 12:39 am</p><hr />
