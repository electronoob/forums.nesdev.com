I can't think why anyone would use anything else... It's really simple to implement in 6502 ASM too. Actually modifying the pattern tables is the hard part.</div>It certainly is a beautiful algorithm but it's hardly the most efficient way to do things. On the 6502 you really need the accumulator both to deal with the Bresenham error term and to combine the pixels, which involves at least a pair of transfers per pixel on the minor axis. Plus it's tricky to avoid the second "correcting" addition to get the error term positive again, especially if the loop is already unrolled on other things.
<br />I've managed to get my "calculation" down to a single two-cycle SBX #$?? per iteration by precalculating the slopes and employing a bithack or two..
<br />
<br />As for the pattern table the key to efficiency is to unroll the loop for the entire tile, that is have 8x8 pieces of code to deal with all the possible pixels within a tile. Naturally this wastes a great deal of ROM space and just keeping the branches in range can be a nightmare but the performance gained is easily worth it.
<br />
<br />(And, yes, I'm inordinately proud of my line drawing code. So sue me..)

I don't think there is a better way to handle that sort of rendering than using a lot of tables. When I was planning a raycaster for the NES (can't say if I'll ever make it) it also used a great deal of pre-calculated values.
<br />
<br />I meant that, as a general line-drawing algorithm, Bresenham was better than anything that included divisions, for example.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, actually, I think it might just be a good idea to not try to PSet directly into the pattern tables. I would take a certain section of RAM and dedicate it to holding copies of the lines. The most calculating you'd have to do would be for the placement on the name tables. Actually, it'd be like doing the PSet function on the name tables with tiles. I can see how this is possible. The only thing I don't get at this point is how to assure that you won't have repeating tiles.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you're going to make CGs, why deal with polygons at all ? I mean you can use them to create your CG, but once they're done you can "convert" images to NES without using any polygons. Just have parts that needs detail use sprites, like people, even if that means one full sprite per frame, and parts that needs less detail should fit in 256 tiles at once using BG.</div>
<br />
<br />Because complete pre-definition takes up too much space. If you can calculate it, you don't have to use nearly as much space. 6 bytes for one line. It's 16 for one tile! If there was a line 256 pixels long, that would be 32 tiles. That is 512 bytes! Why waste all that space when you can just use 6 bytes and a little math? Oh, and if you're wondering why you'd want to use crappy looking 3D compared to nice/colorful/detailed sprites, it's because it's funny! And also, if people would have been playing the game back in the day, they would have crapped their pants in awe of the 3D graphics.
<br />
<br />I don't know how many bytes it would be for filling at this point, but I'm sure it's nothing big. For tiles, the most it would be is as many tiles as there are lines + 1 (For a completely solid tile).
<br />
<br />Well, it seems that the amount of space required to do this is 5k (1k for a copy of the name table, and 4k for the copy of the BG part of the pattern table). Guess what the really good news is for me. In my game, I use SRAM to hold saved game information. However, it only takes up a little more than 3k! So the really great news is that I can make up for that "little more than 3K" by predefining the solid tiles. That makes me excited.
<br />
<br />Another thing that worries me is drawing a line in the same 8-pixel field as another line. But I'm sure it's possible.
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oh, and the Bresenham line algorithm is really the way to go, I think. Since the only multiplication/division it requires is by multiples of 2.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think I've finally implemented a working raster "system", that is making sure that the char and nametable transfers can run properly during an extended blanking period, and ironed out the remaining line drawing bugs and fill-convention issues. You see the drawback with XOR-filling is that off-by-one errors can screw up the rest of the (vertical) scanline, so you have to be damned sure that your lines actually reach their proper destinations..
<br />
<br />So without further ado I reveal to you the very first proof-of-concept demo of filled polygons for the NES: <a href="http://www.minoan.ath.cx/~doynax/6502/polynes.nes" class="postlink">http://www.minoan.ath.cx/~doynax/6502/polynes.nes</a>
<br />To run this you'll need an emulator with a fairly complete implementation of illegal opcodes, which seems to exclude everything except Nestopia out-of-the-box (though at least FCEU can be trivially patched). Hardware-wise it's just a 128k MMC1 cart with SRAM and CHR-RAM (Zelda without battery backing in other words), but I have no illusions that it'll work on a real console just yet. Oh, and it's written for NTSC since I wanted to target the lowest common denominator.
<br />
<br />Now there's still a great deal of code cleanup/polish, compatibility testing and optimization and left to do before I can move on to actual 3D work. But with a bit of luck it shouldn't be too long now (yeah, right..)
<br />
<br />Alas, my only regret is that I failed to provoke anyone into stating that polygon filling is impossible ;)

<br />I'm one that believes that the NES is capable of much more than what has already been done with it. It's just amatter of figuring out HOW.

<br />That's not it... when I disable it, the screen jumps around, so it becomes worse. With the limit enabled, the tiles are just messed up, but they are in the correct places.

<br />I've tried downloading a fresh (Win32) version of Nestopia 1.37 and fetching my own ROM from the server. And it works out-of-the-box.
<br />Worse, I can't find any setting to tweak besides the sprite limit that fucks up it. Even PAL mode actually works, albeit slowly.
<br />
<br />Any chance you could send me your emulator + ROM set just as a sanity test?
