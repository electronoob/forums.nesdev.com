I was thinking and it would be cool to run this tool in real-time, with the NES playing along, so you could hear how well it matches the source material.<br /><br />BTW, when making problem reports, it's good to describe the symptoms, rather than just that it doesn't work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Nov 08, 2010 9:38 am</p><hr />

Well I didn't ask for it to be converted to C, but thank you for doing it.<br />I tried to compile it under windows but failed miserably. I downloaded both libraries you are mentionning, one comes in the form of an installer and I'm not sure where it gets installed, and the other I was able to get. Anyways, gcc still says both .h files are missing and can't compile the thing.<br /><br />(you know, no offense but not everyone here is a PHD in computer science).<br /><br />@blargg : you have a perfect point. I'm more interested in this tool for curiosity than anything else. It could be used as an inspiration tool to make drums manually too (instead of "blindly" copy it's output).<br />You can make noise splash which doesn't sound like real drums at all but goes well along a song. Castlevania is a good example of this, it comes with 2 kind of noise splashes for all percussion, and this works well. Wizard &amp; Warriors II would be another example of this.<br /><br />Also, I think the drum kit in Ferrari Grand Prix Challenge (from Neil <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ) and Blaster Master sounds absolutely amazingly close to a real drum kit with kick, snare and hats. It's hard to make a crash cymbal without having the other drums stop playing unfortunately.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Nov 06, 2010 3:16 pm</p><hr />

The demo isn't really convincing of this approach being better than just making drums manually, though I may be missing the point of the tool. Thinking about the big picture, the following comes to mind:<br /><br />With traditional percussion, composer uses those that best elicit the desired "feeling" when listening. Presumably the development of drums themselves was shaped by this as well, so we have drums that form a good sound palette.<br /><br />With this tool, sound palette is drums put through tool, forming a sound palette that might not be optimal anymore. Traditional drum sounds are somewhat limited by the physics of drums, so the best palette using them is shaped by these limitations. If different limitations were present, a different palette might be better. Converting a palette based on the physical limitations of drums to the limitations of the NES is unlikely to give the best palette for the NES.<br /><br />Making new drum sounds on the NES and tuning them until they sound good is likely to yield the best drum palette for a NES. Here, it's not their similarity to physical drums that's important (though that may play a role), it's just their effect on the listener that's refined.<br /><br />Anyway, just a thought that came to mind when scanning this thread and listening to the demo.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Nov 06, 2010 12:40 pm</p><hr />

To dig up this post again from the dead, bregalad was pestering me about it on the wiki, and I said "eh... needs to be rewritten in C"<br /><br />So I did. It now deals correctly with sample rates other than 48kHz. It now assumes an "ideal" white spectrum by directly calculating the spectrum of the lowpass caused by the noise hardware rather than comparing to a sampled reference. The gain calculation seems incorrect, but it's the same one I was using before.<br /><br />source code: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://eamp.org/li/preanalyze.c">http://eamp.org/li/preanalyze.c</a><!-- m --><br />demonstration rom: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://eamp.org/li/noise.nes">http://eamp.org/li/noise.nes</a><!-- m --><br /><br />noise.nes- samples play on A,B,select,start,down,left. Down and Left are a comparison of the old analyzer to the new one respectively.<br /><br />To build this you'll need fftw3 and libsndfile. I don't have a windows machine to build this on but it should be much easier than fighting with PDL.<br /><br />I release it to the public domain, or if you're in a place where that's not allowed, under the WTFPL.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Sat Nov 06, 2010 12:04 pm</p><hr />

Once you have the filter, you can take its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform" class="postlink">Z-transform</a> to find the "poles" and "zeroes", which are related to which frequency bands a filter increases or decreases.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Fri Jun 26, 2009 7:02 pm</p><hr />
