<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Can you make your scanline emulator emulate part-of-a-scanline?<br /></div><br /><br />Yes, I remembered this after I posted. Most of the time rendering covers multiple scanlines, which can be optimized using a scanline-granularity renderer (which actually renders n scanlines at a time, where n &gt;= 1). When there's a partial scanline, then things need to be done pixel-by-pixel (for that scanline only). I guess the main barrier to this is the complexity and small benefit it brings. If there were more NES demos that relied on these things, it might be more encouraging for an emulator author to go all the way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sun Oct 02, 2005 6:41 am</p><hr />

Can you make your scanline emulator emulate part-of-a-scanline? If so, it'd be easy to bring it up to pixel accuracy. Start by simply running the CPU ahead of the PPU and then having the PPU catch up to the CPU on every CPU$2xxx write. See which games screw up under that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat Oct 01, 2005 7:45 pm</p><hr />

I certainly agree that a claim of accuracy at the very least requires a pixel-accurate PPU rendering, not scanline-based. Maybe the criticism of inaccuracy is based on Nesticle and the common belief that it's the standard in accuracy.<br /><br />But regarding goal 1 (fun), one needs a reasonable amount of accuracy for an emulator to be fun. When I first wrote my emulator it rendered the whole screen at once, so the status bar at the top scrolled with the screen. It was somewhat fun, but not near as much as when I improved it to scanline accuracy. There are so few games (that I know of) that require more than scanline accuracy that it's not worth it in terms of fun. Limiting accuracy to scanlines makes rendering simple to code and very fast (I can run 11 emulators tiled on screen at 60 fps on my 400 MHz Mac). Because of this, I think aiming for "mere" scanline accuracy isn't a reason for criticism.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Oct 01, 2005 6:29 pm</p><hr />

WedNESday, I imagine your enthusiasm for supporting the hardware exactly might wane when you find out all the intricate details. I've been testing the PPU's VBL flag recently and it's quite intricate (yes, the simple behavior of being set and cleared automatically).<br /><br />I don't think there's anything wrong with an emulator running a limited set of games, <em>as long</em> as it's not being claimed to be a full NES emulator or that it emulates those games correctly. Some reasons for writing an emulator have little to do with general accuracy. There's an odd elitism I've seen here recently regarding the "correct" way to experiment with NES emulation. Obviously there is only one correct NES emulator (one that performs exactly as the hardware does), but that's not the only possible goal. This elitist attitude takes the fun out of writing an emulator and discussing it here.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sat Oct 01, 2005 2:45 pm</p><hr />

Since a real NES can run all games using the same engine, a good emulator will do also. Leave the number of VBlank scanlines at 20 as this is correct. Making your emulator custom for certain games is what very old (and therefore crappy emulators used to do). Never introduce hacks for games, if it doesn't work then go back and find out why, as this is considered good programming practice.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=191">WedNESday</a> — Sat Oct 01, 2005 9:06 am</p><hr />

Well, you have a sprite #0 test, but it's nothing more than a sprite #0 test over a canonical background pattern. You should pay attention about a complex image - if the PPU scroll registers are reset in a wrong time, sprite #0 will fail out (no background pattern at that time).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Sat Oct 01, 2005 4:12 am</p><hr />

Does that mirroring apply only while reading data, or for both read and write to the name table ? If it's both, then the nametable used for all 4 screens is determined by the single mirroring bit regardless of if the game write or reads it. In that case, it would probably change several times in a single VBlank while uploading status bar's tiles and playfield tiles.<br />Else, that would mean that write to PPU $2000-$23fff will write to nametable 1, and write to PPU $2400-$27fff will write to nametable 2. Then, when the screen is rendered, only the name table 1 or 2 is used in function of the 1-screen mirroring bit. That would make programmer's live easier, but it would need extra logic on the cartridge.<br />I don't know wich one of those is correct for a mapper 7 game.

Firstly, you *should* write a debugger. I'm sure the hang occurs because of sprite #0 hits - there's no background pattern due to ppu scroll reset timing. YES, my emulator has a similar problem - the game works, but it hangs "randomly" on Impact Crater stage *due to* sprite #0 (infinity loop).<br /><br />Secondly, it might be a CPU bug.
