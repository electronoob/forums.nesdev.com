		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hoping for some inspiration here so feel free to chip in (sorry) with any ideas.
<br />
<br />Currently I have a full note table in Nijuu - 80-or-so 16 bit entries, the index into the table being the current note number. Familiar stuff I'm sure.
<br />
<br />Couple of things bug me with this approach though;
<br />
<br />1 - Pitch sweeping. I currently have to calculate (real time) the fractional step size to get from one note to another in a given number of frames. This involves a few 16-bit maths operations. It works but it's clumsy.
<br />
<br />2 - Vibrato. Currently I just add an 8-bit value to the value pulled from the note table, in a cyclic fashion (add for one frame, subtract for 2, add for 1, repeat). Again, it works but the obvious flaw is that the effect is not uniform over all octaves.
<br />
<br />3 - Arpeggio. I attempted to implement arpeggio in combination with pitch sweeping by working out the 16-bit difference between the root note and each arpeggio offset (+/- from the root) and then adding that to the current 16-bit value that gets written to the 02/03 registers. I got it working (of sorts) but there was a flaw in it (I could explain in a separate post) and it was a horrible mess of code so it's currently in the commented-out-graveyard.
<br />
<br />So I've been trying to figure out if there's a better way. An older thread discussing pitch tables and (I think it was Bregalad) the idea of having intermediate steps in between each note value (a figure of 31 steps in between was discussed) got me thinking along those lines. But for me that would generate a ridiculously large look-up table (80 notes  x 32 intermediate steps x 2 bytes = 5120 byte table!) so I've given up with that thinking.
<br />
<br />Any ideas?

<br />Some people do not store values for all octaves, instead they just have the values for one octave and use bit shifting to get the others. 12 x 32 x 2 = 768, not that ridiculous.

<br />
<br />I did think about that but I don't use an octave command (notes are just 8-bit indexes into the current note table) so I'd have to change that too.
<br />
<br />Plus wouldn't it still be quite a messy bit of addressing (and further calculations)? I'm scribbling stuff down on paper at the moment trying to work out the implications. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Then keep subtracting 12 and shifting the frequency value until it ends up where it needs to be. As for arpeggio, you will probably need to store the "base" note's note number, and then look up each of the other notes on each frame.

<br />
<br />Meanwhile, the topic in hand.
<br />
<br />I've now got a look-up table that has 32 steps in between each note of the lowest octave and I've modified my note-fetching routine to successfully turn my original note numbers into some useful data.
<br />
<br />However, I've been wracking my brains to try to come up with a method to sweep the pitch in big steps.
<br />
<br />I've basically got a variable "note_fraction" which is essentially the 1/32 step in between notes. So I've been adding values to this and when it goes over $20, increment the note (0 to 11), incrementing the octave number if the note number goes over 11. Then re-grab the data from the new table. It works but you're limited to the size of number you can add to the fractional part before it stops increasing the amount of pitch shift.
<br />
<br />Any thoughts?

<br />Don't think so. Where ya lookin'?
<br />
<br />If it's before the "sbc #$0c" it's deliberate, the carry is set after the BCC instruction.
