		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES CPU runs at the same speed as that of the Atari 7800 and (assuming a 2:1 IPC ratio*) the Master System. The 65816 in the Super NES likewise runs about the same instructions per second as the 68000 in the Genesis (<a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=92238#p92238" class="postlink">proof</a>), and it has almost the same data bus bandwidth. One problem is the 65816's relative lack of certain C-friendly constructs present in the 68000, such as 32-bit registers, autoincrement addressing modes, abuse of the address generator as an ALU with the LEA instruction, and 16-bit multiplication and division. (The built-in multiplier and divider on the S-CPU are 8-bit.) Switching between operating on 8- and 16-bit values requires setting a mode (using REP or SEP), which takes programmer care to ensure that the mode is correct at subroutine entry and exit. The packed pixel format of the Genesis VDP is also more convenient for certain data compression methods.<br /><br />It is, however, an improvement over the 6502, with new addressing modes that take some of the load off the X and Y registers: movable zero page is a frame pointer freeing X, zero page indirect without indexing frees Y, and stack-relative addressing modes free X. Dedicated instructions (JML, PHK, PLB, PHB) and addressing instructions perform bank switching with less pain. And the S-CPU has a DMA unit at $004300 that can perform both Blast Processing (hardware accelerated memcpy to video memory) and automatic raster effects.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: normal">* Let C64 fans who fought in the C64 vs. Speccy flame wars correct me.</span>

There are some games that run smoother on the NES than their SNES counterpart, which doesn't make sense because they could've used practically the same code for both systems, and the SNES would've still ran a bit faster.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To answer the original question, I think nobody really had much of a problem with the SNES CPU exept Sega fanboys. The CPU was the only part of the Megadrive's hardware which was not clearly much more worse than the SNES' (they are about of equal processing power, as shown by tepples). However, being clocked about 2x faster, Sega used it as a marketing argument into tricking people to think the CPU was faster with so-called &quot;Blast processing&quot;. Back then, nobody really knew anything about processor architecture exept professionals, and the general public was under the wrong assumption that the clock frequency was the only way to measure a CPU performance.<br />Unfortunately it only measures performance between two processors of the same architecture.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Switching between operating on 8- and 16-bit values requires setting a mode (using REP or SEP), which takes programmer care to ensure that the mode is correct at subroutine entry and exit.</div><br />On a related note, is there any use for register smaller than 16-bit, other than writing to 8-bit memory mapped I/O ? Or is the point to reduce the code or data size ? Considering how large SNES carts and it's RAM can be I think it's much less of an issue than on the NES.

A lot of RPGs use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding" class="postlink">digram coding</a> (also called BPE or DTE), which allocates half of the 8-bit space to a binary tree representing common combinations of characters that appear together. For example, $80 could represent &quot;qu&quot; and $81 could represent $80 followed by &quot;e&quot;, squeezing &quot;que&quot; into one byte. Others use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding" class="postlink">Huffman coding</a>, assigning short bit strings either to individual characters or <a href="http://pineight.com/mw/?title=Huffword" class="postlink">to entire words</a>. <em>Star Ocean</em> and <em>Street Fighter Alpha 2</em> use so much compression on their tile data that it takes a separate IC in the cart to undo it.

I have always questioned if SNES games were actually written in asm, because of it being so time consuming, and the amount of slowdown in some games.</div><br /><br />Lots of SNES games and I'm sure Genesis games were programmed in Assembly. Some were also programmed in C. At the end of the day their performance is what matters. Just because a game suffers slowdowns isn't because it was programmed in C. It's entirely possible that a game is programmed quite efficiently but it just has too large of a workload to avoid slowdown due to the design of the game or the exact situation occurring. <br /><br />I do recall hearing that Capcom CPS2 arcade games were programmed in C. It's era was from 1993 onward. And it ofcourse used the 68000. I imagine alot less console games prior to the 32bit generation were programmed in C than in ASM. ASM may be more time consuming but we are talking about people for whom this was their job. It's different than being a hobbyist.
