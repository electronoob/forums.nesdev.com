<br />I'm having a really hard time finding connectors, or even old floppy cables locally.  I know a few places I can order either online, but I was hoping to work on it a bit tonight.
<br />
<br />There's one place in Morgan Hill and another in Downtown San Jose that might have it - i'm going to try to make the drivce to check at least one of them out today.

<br />
<br />Is there a specific name (besides 5.25" floppy cables) for ribbon cables with connectors like these:

<br />
<br />There is a small shop in morgan hill that might have them, but I showed up 10 minutes after closing, so I wont know until friday at the earliest unless I can get a more specific name. (I kind of sucked at describing them over the phone.)  I can find tons of "Contemporary" style floppy connectors, but unless there is some trick I dont know, I cant use those.
<br />
<br />Again, a shot of the kind of connector, and "the dream" here:
<br /><img src="http://benheck.com/Games/Nintendo_projects/NES_Micro/NM_pic_1.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Any terms this is commenly refered to that might help me find it? (Or find a place to order it online so I can be 100% sure i'm ordering the right thing?)

<br />
<br />It shoudl be pretty easy to make the BRK to $0000 model to work, so i'm planning to go with that - a few seconds delay between switching the games should do it.  If all else fails, i'm happy to simply hold the reset button in-between switches (and i'm going to do it anyway for games with save cabaility) - though i'm going to see what I can do to keep it automatic.
<br />
<br />I've found a grand total of TWO 5.25 cables, enough to make ONE whopping connector. I need at least two more to make a prototype thing.  I'm going to check the local salvage shop tommorrow.
<br />
<br />Apparently, you can also use those connectors to read SD cards.  It's not useful for this project, but I might make use of it elsewhere knowing it.

<br />Ugh. These were a bitch to find.  The guy at my local surplus computer salvage place had a few universal cables for $3 each.   I picked up enough to make a prototype 2-game switch -- If it works and I feel confident, I have some sources (thanks to those of you who PM'd me) to get some full NES 72 pins at about the same price. I'll just use those next time to make it easier - I don't think i'm going to find any more of these locally.
<br />
<br />APparently fry's ussually carries them, but the one on Brokaw (downtown san jose) didn't have them, and they would probably be $9 there anyway - not worth it.
<br />
<br />
<br />My friend Mike is getting here with there spare system in tow tommorrow, so we'll see if we can get most of the work done by nightfall Saturday.  With any luck, i'll have some pictures (and maybe a video) of a working two-switch up by midday sunday.
<br />
<br />If nothing else, i'll post an update with the problems we ran into.

<br />
<br />Why go through all that trouble?  It's silly and will be fragile and intermittant.  An NES cart has a 2.5mm pitch connector, while those things are .1"  (2.54 mm).  It may work but it's gonna be somewhat flaky.  Not to mention the board thickness is wrong too.  Carts are 0.043" thick while those IDC connectors are designed for 0.062" thickness boards...  Meaning the cart will be "floppy" in the floppy cable connector.
<br />
<br />I just checked ebay and found someone selling 5 game genies for $25, which ended up being $7 a connector with shipping.   Just take those off the boards and get a perfect connector designed to fit.  There's alot of hits for "game genie" and they seem to be fairly cheap.
<br />
<br />If you really got a chubby to do this still, I suggest switching the following signals:   (CPU) A14, /CE, IRQ.  (CHR) CIRAM A10, /RD.
<br />
<br />And if you have more than 5 carts, put tristate bidirectional buffers on D0-D7 for each CHR/PRG for every 5 carts, and single direction buffers for A0-A13 on CHR, /WR, /A13.   And A0-A14, R/W, M2 for PRG.
<br />
<br />Anything else will be frought with peril.  Don't forget bypassing caps either or else things will probably be flaky, oh and you will need a new power supply.  The 7805 in the NES probably can't handle more than 2 or 3 carts at once.

Unless there's something i'm missing, this is really just the main trick to this problem, and if anything it's just going to be slightly annoying to wire and time consumign.  It's funny - I read it on the first page, forgot about it, thought of it on my own, and then re-read the thread and realized i'm not so smart.<br /><br />Anyway, that's what i'm trying saturday.<br /><br /><br />[quote=Kevtris]Why go through all that trouble? It's silly and will be fragile and intermittant.[/quote]
<br />No it wont.  If half of the projects from Ben Heck are any indication, they make a pretty decent connector - and a connector made from these cables typicaly works much better than the 72 pin native to the system.
<br />
<br />Also, $7.00 a connector is way to pricy for me - my income is pretty low, so i'm kind of working on a budget.  I only bouht enough parts to make four connectors today because it's all i could afford - - and that's with a cost of about $3 a connector.

<br />
<br />If something requires electricty to function, it stops functioning when it loses its source of electricity. I don't see any way the games could function without a source of power.
<br />
<br />I ussually find that the simplist sultion is ussually the best one.  We'll see if it holds true today. (Hopefully. There's always the chance we wont finish today, but i'm going to try my hardest to get SOMETHING by the time I get to bed.)

By having the GND and signals still connected, the chip will pull from those and start giving you outputs.  All those "unpowered" chip outputs collide with the ones you want and nothing works.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">seaniccus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I ussually find that the simplist sultion is ussually the best one.</div>
<br />Simplest solution is also frequently wrong, which is why there are multiple posts from the smartest people here telling you the correct way (besides the off topic rom stuff).  Basically:
<br />- Cutting VCC will not work
<br />- You need to control the select lines to each cart
<br />-  Multiple carts will need buffers and another power source
<br />-  Long floppy cables will kill everything unless you have buffers
<br />
<br />Nobody is trying to discourage you from doing this.  The ones that know electronics are just pointing out that it isn't as easy as soldering some wires.  On a comical note, while they are good with the dremel and hot glue the ben heck forums aren't known for their technical expertise  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
