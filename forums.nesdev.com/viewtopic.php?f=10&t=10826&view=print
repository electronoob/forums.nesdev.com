		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After playing around with lesson #3 of the Advanced Nerdy Nights (<a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=36958" class="postlink">http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=36958</a>), I was wondering how one might go about loading endless, random nametable data into the program? Not entirely random data, of course, but random sets of pre-defined columns (in other words, the columns are not random, only the order). I can think of several different ways conceptually, but then they all spiral out of control in my head and leave me starring off into space for hours at a time. I have in mind something similar to Sivakâ€™s Fall Down game from a few years ago (<a href="http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=13981" class="postlink">http://www.nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=13981</a>), but moving horizontally. There are probably other examples, but I cannot think of any off of the top of my head (feel free to mention any; ideas never hurt). Thanks for any help, and if this question needs clarification just let me know!

In place of having the program load SMBLevel.bin I have it load the above, all the way down to 1-16 (and yes, I know that the last few digits at the end of each pair of lines is thrown out since it only loads 30 as opposed to 32 tiles). The only way to re-arrange the order in this scheme is to re-arrange the sets. I assume that some kind of pointer table could allow for each set to be handled individually, but I am not sure how to load these into a string.

In my defense it was up to 32x256, but I began to suspect that there might be a better way. With some help I managed to alter the NN code to be dependent on player movement, and it only scrolls in one direction and loops back to the beginning once it finishes. With that said, I do not know what you mean about keeping track of where I am at. Isn't it always at where it needs to be? Sorry if that is less than helpful, feel free to educate me. I am learning as I go.

That's a different set of skills than adapting source code, and a bit beyond my ability to explain.<br /><br />Otherwise, somewhere there should be a pointer in the code, something like a <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">lda &#40;something&#41;,y</tt> instruction; it is that (something) that is keeping track of which tile it's uploading.

Looking over it again, the only change that I have made to the NN code is replacing &quot;columndata,&quot; which pointed to a BIN file that I could not figure out how to peek at, with my overly gigantic array. SourceLow would appear to be the instruction that is keeping track of what tile to load.

Each time you call DrawNewColumn it calculates the source pointer, destination pointer, and then uploads those 30 bytes.<br /><br />As you noticed, it's the &quot;scroll&quot; variable that chooses which of the 256 columns to upload. &quot;DrawColumn&quot; doesn't modify &quot;scroll&quot;, only reads it.<br /><br />So now you just need to figure out how you want to modify &quot;scroll&quot; before you call &quot;DrawColumn&quot;.<br /><br />Does this make sense?
