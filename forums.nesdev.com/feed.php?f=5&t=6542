Haha thanks guys for the replies and amusement. I started fooling with the TCC and got it working and was just assembling some sample programs online. It seems that alot of stuff when you google for C is C++, Is there a TCC  equivalent for TCC to assemble C++? So far I am liking C, It is very interesting to see stuff run on PC as opposed to like the NES and such. ^_^<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Aaron<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Sun Jul 04, 2010 8:51 pm</p><hr />

Never underestimate the power of buffering. If the stream abstraction works, use it. Oh yeah, always be sure to check the return value from fclose() when you've written to a file.<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> just in case it wasn't clear, my point was that putc and getc <em>do</em> buffer for you automatically, so you don't need to clutter your program with explicit buffers. Using just them is perfectly valid and efficient.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Mon Jun 28, 2010 1:27 pm</p><hr />

I guess it seems logical to me that if you want to code a complex project, you want to use a complex IDE, and if you want to code a simple table generator or something, you use a simple command line tool.<br /><br />I guess GCC/G++ allows both, but I have issues with this :<br />- I have no idea how to acess your hard disk, which is required for anything NES-developement related (I had so many courses where they tell us to do a lot of very complex things and NEVER ACESS HARD DISK)<br />- When you have an error in C++ code, it's just INSANE to find where it's located and where to fix it. The error messages form G++ (and likely GCC too, although I never used it much) does make absoultely NO sense if you're not an experienced computer science PHD.<br /><br />So I mostly use Java.

For the IDE, it all depends what you code. If you do a lot of .net coding and do it in notepad... I'm going to slap you silly, really. For .net VS is great. For C/C++, it's not perfect but there is no perfect IDE for that (too hard to parse C/C++ code) but the debugger is quite good.  Remote debugging an IIS 7 process is a breeze. Still didn't figure out how to do the same thing with apache/eclipse on linux thought (...).<br /><br />If you do C/C++ on win32 platform, you should use VS since the debugger is worth it.  For just compiling stuff, GCC is more than enough.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Mon Jun 28, 2010 6:58 am</p><hr />

Well... the good ones, anyway.</div><br />I meant that if you are making simple programs (converters, table generators, etc) using IDEs might be overkill, not that the IDEs are simple programs. Sorry if that wasn't clear.<br /><br />Yeah, I absolutely hate bloatware, and will try to avoid it as much as possible. I do like to use tools that make my job easier (at home I use Notepad++ for coding 6502 for example), but I don't like to depend on them, so I make sure I can still just pick any random PC and use crappy old Notepad for the same purpose, without having to worry about what's installed and what's not.<br /><br />It may seem like a strange scenario for some people, but a while ago I used to have access to a lot of different PCs, like at work, college, family members' places, and by keeping this minimalistic approach I could always squeeze some development time out of busy days.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jun 28, 2010 4:24 am</p><hr />
