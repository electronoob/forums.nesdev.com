Unless they're running those 3V chips at 5V, and not using a voltage regulator, in which case I'd be a lot more concerned.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If the chip fails faster when using 5V, either it would fail immediately or over time. <br /><br />Clearly, there's no immediate failure when using the cartridge normally. I believe the EMS cart has a voltage regulator. I know the bootleg carts don't most of them time. What I've found is that while you can read from the bootleg carts, you can't write to the flash while the supply voltage is 5V. A crude way of dealing with that is to add a diode across the supply line, which some of these carts helpfully include a pad for on the board. The diode drop just barely brings the voltage below the absolute maximum rating, and you can flash the flash chip. <br /><br />Then there's long term use. I think the CMOS output drivers couldn't care less about the supply voltage. However, a read operation in a flash chip is ever so slightly destructive to the data, because it depletes the charge in the floating gate of the cell. This is true for flash chips under all conditions regardless of voltage conditions. It's possible that using a 5V supply makes that problems slightly worse. But you're still probably looking at many years of data retention.<br /><br />All in all, I wouldn't worry too much.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Using a 3V IC, supplied by 3V, in a 5V system, without current limiting... <em>that</em> will stress the driver and the overvoltage protection diodes. In the case of CMOS systems (like the GB and SNES), that's definitely a problem.<br /><br />(For NMOS systems like the NES and SMS, it maybe might not, because NMOS pullups are just not very good at things)<br /><br /><br />For a 3V IC, supplied by 5V, <em>that</em> will cause a whole different set of weird failure modes, but at the beginning, they &quot;ought&quot; to be limited to destroying the 3V peripheral. (Once the 3V peripheral is sufficiently damaged it could become a short, then damaging the 5V driver).<br /><br />One of the weird failure modes is what I'm referring to in my tangent related to that PDF: bits that were programmed may read as not, randomly.

Leakage through the protection diodes could be a likely cause. I haven't heard about permanent damage to the CPU from using an EMS64 cart, though.
