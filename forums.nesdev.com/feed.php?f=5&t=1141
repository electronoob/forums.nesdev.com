<title type="html"><![CDATA[Strange GBS Problem]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=1141&amp;p=9767#p9767"><![CDATA[
After ripping Keep the Balance, I find myself in a strange predicament. The rip works great when converted to a gb rom (w/ gbsplay 1.02), but fails to play correctly as a GBS file itself in all of the players I have tried.<br /><br />Usually when a difference like this pops up, it's a result of incorrect banks being selected. Different players do different things when selecting a bank that's not present in the GBS file. However, when I checked to see if the correct bank values were being written in the rom conversion with a debugger, I found no potential problems. All bank numbers were correct.<br /><br />I was wondering if anyone here has some insight as to what could cause this to problem. Here are the files (GBS and GB ROM conversion): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://h1.ripway.com/kingshriek/balance.zip">http://h1.ripway.com/kingshriek/balance.zip</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br />Below is some information on the rip:<br /><br /><br /><br />The game contains seven tracks, each having it's own bank. In the game, the music data banks are at 0A-10. I relocated them to 02-08 in the GBS. The game's main music routines (init/play) are in bank 0, with some auxillary routines in bank 2 (which I relocated to bank 1 for the rip). <br /><br />Also, the game's actual init routine is at $307, but I relocated it to $2307 for the GBS rip, changing all necessary hardcoded addresses. More precisely, I moved $200-$83F in the ROM to $2200-$283F in the GBS. This was done to make it work with gbsplay, which needs 1024 bytes. ($0-$3FF).<br /><br />The game does a lot of stack manipulation/referencing in the music routines. For example, in the init routine, the song number is read from sp+04, where sp is the vale of the stack pointer immediately after the routine is entered. I accounted for this when writing the GBS's init wrapper.<br /><br />The rip's init routine is as follows:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">push af<br />la a,01<br />ld &#40;2000&#41;,a    ; in the game itself, bank 02 is used<br />call 4000      ; initialize sound registers<br />ld a,05<br />ld &#40;cafa&#41;,a    ; counter for play routine - routine is called once every 5 times<br />ld a,01<br />ld &#40;c26e&#41;,a    ; needed so play routine is carried out<br />pop af<br />add a,0a       ; song number - same as in game bank number<br />ld c,a         ; transfer song number to the high byte of a 16-bit register<br />push bc        ; needed for stack alignment<br />push bc        ; game's init routines reads song number from this position<br />ld hl,4000<br />push  hl       ; address read from in game's init routine<br />call 2307      ; game's init routine<br />pop hl<br />pop hl<br />pop hl<br />call 4026      ; set up music tempo - bank # is 01 before called<br />ret</div><br /><br />Any help/information will be greatly appreciated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=190">kingshriek</a> — Sat Feb 18, 2006 11:38 am</p><hr />
