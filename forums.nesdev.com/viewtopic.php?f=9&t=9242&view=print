		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was working on a batch of <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/product_info.php?cPath=24&amp;products_id=42" class="postlink">ReproPak</a> boards today, and after finishing I attempted to clean the rosin spatter with 99% isopropyl alcohol. I noticed this caused the solder mask to become sticky, and after drying none of the boards functioned at all (would not boot).<br /><br />I have built many ReproPak cartridges in the past, and I remember this happening once before but I wasn't sure if it was related to using alcohol on the PCB. Since then I avoided doing that just in case (i.e. cleaning the card edge contacts only, but leaving any rosin on the board), but something compelled me to try it again today, and given that all of them failed without exception it does seem to me that the alcohol did some serious damage to the boards.<br /><br />Has anyone else experienced this? I've cleaned lots of other PCBs with isopropyl alcohol and they never became sticky as a result, just these ReproPak boards.<br /><br />Edit: I have found a solution to this problem. With a very thorough scrubbing with more alcohol, followed by a quick rinse in water and a quick dry, whatever the offending substance is eventually washes away.<br /><br />Not sure what it was. Rosin would explain the stickiness, but I don't know why it could cause the board not to function. It appeared to me that when I began scrubbing the board would become sticky on its own, whether or not there was rosin spatter. With further scrubbing it would eventually go away.

I presumed this was a reference to the plastic cases.<br /><br /><br />The isopropyl alcohol leaves a sticky surface behind, but there is otherwise no visual evidence of damage to the board after using it. I dunno, I've been cleaning grime/rosin/dust off PCBs for years with alcohol with no problem. Is this problem common with custom made PCBs in general, or is it just something specific to this one?

It's kind of mysterious. Everything is still visibly red where it should be, just a bit sticky.<br /><br />I tried desoldering and resoldering one of them, but it didn't seem to help. My multimeter doesn't have a continuity mode, but I did do some checks with the ohmmeter. I didn't get any helpful information out of that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hm, I could take a picture of the bad boards, but they look the same as a good board in a photograph.<br /><br />Hmm, now that they've been drying for a day they're not really sticky anymore. I guess whatever substance was created by the interaction takes a while to dry, unlike the alcohol itself.<br /><br />The end result is that the solder mask surface is rough to the touch instead of smooth, to varying degrees (I guess depends on how hard I brushed it at the time). Still the same behaviour now that they're dry though: game won't run.<br /><br />If you'd like a pile of non-functioning boards I'd be willing to mail them to you. I just consider them a loss; I've tried as much as I'm willing to get them working. I had actually thrown them in the electronic waste bin, but they were still there today so I took them back out to look at them.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If isopropyl alcohol is going to destroy the PCB from contact, that's not okay as far as the PCB design goes. I've doused (turned-off and discharged) NES and SNES motherboards in alcohol as well as liberally applied it to cartridge PCBs that were properly manufactured with no such issues... it should evaporate on its own and be as if it was never there.

He seem usualy pretty busy but if I was manufacturing PCB to sell to hobbyist like he is, it's something I would be damn interested in hearing! If this is the case, I wpuld write a big notice in cap on the product page and in the manual. I hardly think you are alone cleaning pcb with rubbing alcohol, I do it all the time and I'm certain many other do the same as it's one of those thing that evaporate so fast. You're saying the boards we're assembled and tested before the cleaning took place? If they stopped working right after, and won'r work after they dried up for days I think it would be worth it to investigate as I do not see any logic behind it. If for sone reason the coating react with the isopropyl alcool, how could it even create such trouble? I understand your confusion as I'm at a loss here too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My guess is the clear coat or whatever the boards are finished with dissolves in the alcohol, and dries in a day or two.  Still doesnt really make sense that it would prevent the boards from working though.  Bunnyboy has recommended &quot;Myro&quot; for PCBs in the past, not sure if that's who he uses or not but it might help the investigation.<br /><br />For some reason I think I've had similar issues with some PCBs I've ordered elsewhere.  At the time I thought it was due to the flux not dissolving well in alcohol.  They worked fine though so I never thought much of it.<br /><br />The only thing that should be conductive on those boards is the copper...  It's possible the sticky mix is conductive, but if it's not enough to pick up with your ohmmeter on the highest setting then I doubt it's the problem.  I would try replacing all the roms and chips on the board, vice just resoldering possible bad roms.<br /><br />So just now I decided to pull one of my old repropaks out and see if I can find the same problem.  I applied a LOT of alcohol several times and never saw any such stickiness.  Are you sure your applying enough alcohol to fully dissolve and remove the solder flux?  Do you have some weird solder with bad flux? You could always try an alcohol bath and see if it improves or worsens since you're considering them trash.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Honestly, I don't have an explanation for it. I'm just describing what I've seen. If I use 99% isopropyl alcohol on my repropak, it becomes sticky and no longer functions. That's all I know. I'm pretty content to just move on and not put alcohol on others in the future. I'd rather not spend 20 hours getting to the bottom of this when I could spend that time making working boards with fresh parts.<br /><br />As for continuity testing, I wouldn't say I've done a thorough test. The ohmmeter doesn't update quickly anything, and there's like 150 points of contact to test, so it's not like I can try every possible combination. As for whether my flux is weird... this has happened with two different rosin-core solders from different manufacturers. I kinda doubt there's anything special about the flux, but... who knows.<br /><br />Specifically what I did was dip a toothbrush in alcohol, then scrubbed the back of the board with it. After that I waved it dry and left it under a fan for a bit.<br /><br />I was really just wondering if anyone else has had this problem. It doesn't really make much sense to me that this would damage a PCB. Sounds like it hasn't happened to anyone else, though? Maybe this only happens to me and something else is going on.<br /><br />I could take one of my working boards and start giving it the alcohol treatment progressively to see when it fails, but I don't think I would find out anything interesting and I'd rather just have one more working board.
