Thanks, but as I said this was just laziness. I just didn't want to do it for some reason at the time, which is hilarious because I fixed it and polished the game in less than an hour, literally. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />The final NROM 16k build of the game is available here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/AleffCorrea/BrickBreaker/blob/master/brix.nes">https://github.com/AleffCorrea/BrickBre ... r/brix.nes</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Now with less ugly visible screen updates, Level 2 completely purged (the #1 reason people didn't care for my game was this unreasonably boring and hard level, I'm sure of it) and levels slightly adjusted and reordered to make for a better experience overall.<br /><br />INL: can you do a quick test on hardware to see if I'm mistiming PPU on/offs? IIRC the screen jumps if you turn the PPU on outside of vblank, I'm almost sure my game does this correctly but it never hurts to ask someone with real hardware to test it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5877">Punch</a> — Tue Feb 27, 2018 9:48 pm</p><hr />

I've just released the source code for my game! It's not pretty but it's there, under the MIT license.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://gitlab.com/aleff/BrixBattle">https://gitlab.com/aleff/BrixBattle</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Edit: aha! I think I got why the paddle-ball collision felt so weird! There's two reasons, first of all my threshold to decide whether to use the left, center or right corner of the ball was too small, making it difficult to &quot;aim&quot;. <br /><br />Secondly, due to the way the paddle graphics are presented, one would expect the ball to merely invert its Y direction when the ball hits the center of the umbrella, since it's a flat surface (and all other flat surfaces i.e. bricks behave that way), but sometimes it reflects on X too due to how the paddle works in this game (sectioned into parts, each giving the ball a fixed movement vector, disregarding the ball's current one).<br /><br />The second one is not much of a problem and it's easy to adapt to it, but the first issue made the second one confusing. I'm in the process of improving the game and that was taken care of and it makes a lot of difference. Check git for the update.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5877">Punch</a> — Fri Feb 24, 2017 3:04 pm</p><hr />

I made them from hacking away pixels from the original structure and moving them into a disarray. I also attempted to move them so that they'd break the tile grid somewhat, to signal the dissaray of a pile. To the upper left is some metatile variations made from the same four tiles. To the lower left they are put next to each other. Randomizing metatile content could perhaps work well.<br /><br />I used the same technique when doing the brick walls and power ups blowing up animations for wrecking balls (there were some compromises and decisions, all frames didn't make it into the submission and others got changed. I just lazily took a snapshot that happened to be sitting on my desktop):<br />animationsequences.bmp<br />Deteriorating things that explode/destruct frame by frame feels easier to me, even if, say, only a few or even one selected frame would be used. <br /><br />In the mockup above in the post, i made an interim frame between 'cracked' and 'destroyed' which would be redundant to the game logic, but helping in the process getting there.</div><br /><br />You're too kind about my pixel art. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br />I think that's an excellent method of doing explosions/destruction. Some variation would also help too, yeah. Your example is very good and while it's unrelated it also has some nice edge embossing to make them distinct when adjacent with one another, something that I wanted to do on my metatile but didn't have time to. I'll see if I can update the art following your tips for the multicart version, thanks a lot.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rainwarrior wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I really like the title screen.

The one that stands out to me is the one for the bricks, which feels like a representation of crushed brick, but perhaps not a direct derivate of the bricks that were there in prior to crushing. <br /><br />Here's a quick mockup (though in a somewhat different style)<br />bricks.bmp<br /><br />To the upper right is simply a metatile of crushed bricks. I made them from hacking away pixels from the original structure and moving them into a disarray. I also attempted to move them so that they'd break the tile grid somewhat, to signal the dissaray of a pile. To the upper left is some metatile variations made from the same four tiles. To the lower left they are put next to each other. Randomizing metatile content could perhaps work well.<br /><br />I used the same technique when doing the brick walls and power ups blowing up animations for wrecking balls (there were some compromises and decisions, all frames didn't make it into the submission and others got changed. I just lazily took a snapshot that happened to be sitting on my desktop):<br />animationsequences.bmp<br />Deteriorating things that explode/destruct frame by frame feels easier to me, even if, say, only a few or even one selected frame would be used. <br /><br />In the mockup above in the post, i made an interim frame between 'cracked' and 'destroyed' which would be redundant to the game logic, but helping in the process getting there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7508">FrankenGraphics</a> — Tue Jan 31, 2017 1:21 am</p><hr />

Super fun happy crunch tiem!<br /><br />The decision of not pushing back the deadline was reasonable, and the right thing to do IMO, specially considering that there's a second category for late submissions. I'm just disappointed that I'm not going to be able to use this video for effect correctly anymore (:P):<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJEmqZcfWJs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJEmqZcfWJs</a><!-- m --><br />&quot;bwahahahah I'm not a game killa hahahahah&quot;<br /><br />Come to think about it, I'm not sure if I can finish the game as I first drafted it to be even if the deadline was extended so no big deal really. I'll just focus in my ブリックブレーカー game for now and do the &quot;full game&quot; for Category 2 <em>if</em> I feel like I can finish it in time for cart inclusion. Here's some footage of the game's current state right now:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/KygvdNaBAV8">https://youtu.be/KygvdNaBAV8</a><!-- m --><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gXh8L8d.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />You probably noticed that it doesn't have any sound. My audio man won't be able to do any arrangements for me (and it's my fault for not asking in advance for them) so it will probably be silent unless I decide to add one of the public domain .ftms I have in my HDD into it.<br />Also, notice that there's a glass object in there (with wrong palette though), I will try to add levels just like the bonus ones I was planning for how the game was originally designed, puzzle maps where you have to get the ball to a target tile without breaking any glass objects. It's just a &quot;if (breaktile(x,y) == TILE_GLASS_SHATTERED) then game_fail()&quot; so I think it might be doable.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">FrankenGraphics wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />This is looking better and better! I like what i see a lot. Congratulations! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/Mfr_icon_homebrew.png" alt=":beer:" title="Beer" /> <br /><br />The graphics are distinct, coherent and <em>fun</em>. If i get to nitpick, maybe the &quot;crushed/passable&quot; characters could perhaps be brought a little more in line with the rest, but that's my subjective view. <br /><br />I suppose it's because that gives the player exploitable control over the ball, + 90 degrees can get balls stuck in persistent loops in some circumstances.<br /></div><br /><br />Thanks, that means a lot <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />I thought that the &quot;damaged/crushed&quot; tiles were ok and not in a different style. That blue shell looking thing was supposed to be jello (???) and not really related to the blue cross tile so please ignore that, esp. considering that I changed it to a more acceptable-looking one (which still might not look like what it's supposed to be):<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1mPEUBn.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It probably won't make into the submitted game though.<br />If you're talking about how the graphics are top-down AND 3/4 perspective, I know that it's kind of jarring but I couldn't get good results when I tried to do the brick wall and iron plate/brick thing in a way that looked isometric. I'll try to improve that later.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5877">Punch</a> — Mon Jan 30, 2017 5:27 pm</p><hr />
