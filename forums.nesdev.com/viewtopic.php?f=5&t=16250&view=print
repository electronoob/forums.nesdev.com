My first programming language was [url]scratch.mit.edu[/url]. It is a block programming language and how I learned was when I was 7 years old, my school had people from SparkFun teach us how to code. I was little and thought that coding was one of the coolest things because of the matrix and what not. But only a few kids could be part of this demonstration, and if you wanted to, you had to write a paper on why they should chose you, and I wrote &quot;Because I know binary&quot; (I kind of lied when I said that, all I did was read about ascii in a book) And I got in. Surprisingly enough, these people didn't have much experience with programming themselves, because they didn't even mention variables  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  (Probably because we were only in 2nd grade and that was a future math concept) And basically, I just dragged blocks and made programs that way.

What computer did you use for Fortran IV, I know that computers like the Apple II and Commodore PET existed, but did you have to use a computer the size of a room?

It was extremely laggy, and it often times crashed my browser. But it was still a good language to get me started with programming. I remember when I came up with how to use variables on my own, it went like this: I wanted to have money in the game. And then I remembered about these things called variables and thought, &quot;What if I had a variable for how much money I have&quot; And sure enough, it worked. I could go on about this story, but it's probably pretty boring so I'll just stop there.

Basic (heh) 6502 assembly on Apple ][ (via reading books, that never worked out). I also managed to learn why most of my graphics hacks of FDS games usually only worked on Side A but not Side B, to no avail, partly due to the disassembly tool I had at the time using awkward mnemonics for the 6502 opcodes, such as using JZ instead of BEQ (and I eventually found out more than two decades later that the reason the hacks not working was because of hidden last files on the disk).<br />5. dBase in some elementary summer course... yeah.<br />6. VERY basic Pascal in University.<br />7. VERY BASIC C++ in University.<br />8. VERY BASIC <strong>COBOL</strong> in University.<br />9. <a href="http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/" class="postlink">AGS</a>.<br />10. Some x86 assembly.<br />11. Revisited 6502 assembly, so I could finally make something that seemed to work on Apple ][ and Famicom.<br />12. Revisited C++.<br />And more of those other languages that I had dipped a bit into but not quite using.<br /><br />I wasn't meant to post all these.

I can legitimately call myself a native programmer. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br /><br />I quickly migrated to Turbo C++ and then flat assembler (x86), which I used to write a Forth OS, before DOS died and I drifted away from programming for a few years. After I switched from Windows to Linux I picked up GCC, which I've been using ever since.<br /><br />Plus a bit of Java for a Minecraft mod I never published, back when it was still a decent game.

I'm sure i never did anything useful but it sparked my interest. After that summer, i borrowed every book on BASIC at the library and read them and copied example code to paper and began to write small programs on the same. Those books were for ABC80, ABC800 and Commodore 64. <br /><br />I then got a 286 with qBasic off the trash bin at mothers' work and finally got to program on an actual computer. Learned how to make batch files by this time too. qBasic is the first language i got to properly learn.<br /><br />My grandma got me a subscription of a webdev magazine by christmas '96 which was my primary source for learning HTML and JS.

It seemed too high-level, like it was hiding the details of how the computer worked from me, and I found it vaguely annoying.<br /><br />I had to learn C++ in college as part of my first year of engineering.  But <em>only</em> the first year.  After that it was several years of nothing but Matlab.  I only got back into C++ at the beginning of my Ph.D., and I still like Matlab better.<br /><br />I never seriously considered learning any sort of assembly language before the spring of '14, when I started my current SNES project.  In fact, my first thought was to ask somebody on NESdev to program the game for me, but I abandoned that idea as a likely lead balloon...
