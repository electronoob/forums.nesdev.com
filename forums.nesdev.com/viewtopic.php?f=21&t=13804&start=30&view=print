		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, I have to admit, the teppels and dougeff's conversions are much better than mine. Although I don't like how the blue color in tepples's version is lost. After all, the image is supposed to show off the color capabilities of the system. I guess dougeff made up for that in his version, but some shades are missing.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">90% of the consoles listed there don't come close to properly displaying the picture, a photograph that has no business being in a video game console to begin with.</div><br />True. It'd be a better idea to show some pixel art, considering the limitations of the systems. Although converting images and figuring out how to make them look good is kinda fun. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />

If the best published sources say X, but even better nonpublic sources say Y, then Y isn't verifiable, and Wikipedia will say X. Wikipedia also tries to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOR" class="postlink">eliminate what it calls &quot;original research&quot;</a>, which would at first glance appear to rule out posting your original pixel art on Wikipedia. (Those, together with &quot;neutral point of view&quot;, are its core content policies.) But because Wikipedia knows that it's in the minority with respect to copyright licensing policies, it welcomes original illustrations &quot;so long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments.&quot; You might be able to justify posting an original pixel art trace of the same parrot that way.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">a photograph that has no business being in a video game console to begin with.</div><br />The conception that photos don't belong in a game console is the problem. A few weeks ago, Holt mentioned an <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=13642" class="postlink">interview with David Crane</a> of <em>Pitfall!</em> and <em>A Boy and His Blob</em>. Crane was looking for less tile repetition and more photorealism in consoles and was disappointed to see <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> embrace tile repetition as its aesthetic. See in particular the trees in the screenshot of <em>A Boy and His Blob</em> that rainwarrior posted.
