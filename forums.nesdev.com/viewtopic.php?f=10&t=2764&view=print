Does anyone know what causes this?

<br />Which supports my earlier idea, that what you think the screen is "supposed to be" is actually wrong, and what you think is wrong is actually right.
<br />
<br />What code are you using to draw <em>before</em> you start scrolling?  You said that's when it shows up "right" -- so that's probably where the problem is.
<br />
<br />Or just upload the whole ROM or source somewhere and link us to it.  It's really hard to remotely debug something with only small code snippits.

<br />
<br />As for "right" being "wrong," I made the nametable using NSA, and it shows up there the same way it shows up when the screen is not scrolled. But whenever I scroll the screen, it suddenly jumps. 
<br />
<br />And for the "during the frame" hypothesis, I do all of this code right after the NMI is triggered. There is nothing else going on.

<br />Your VRAM address got left at $3F10 after writing to the palette, which is effectively moving the viewport upward. You must initialize the VRAM address before you enable rendering, and it also doesn't hurt to set it on <strong>every</strong> frame.
<br />
<br />In short, Disch was right.

<br />
<br />Anyway -- having looked it over:
<br />
<br />- in your 'ClrMem' routine you're performing STA's without ever having set A to anything (no prior LDA command).  So you're effectively writing garbage instead of $00
<br />
<br />- You're having NMIs occur, but you never RTI, you just jump back to your infinite loop, which will cause your stack to overflow like mad (run your ROM in FCEUXD and look at RAM at $0100-01FF in the memory viewer / hex editor).  This will still work for what you're doing now -- but it's bad practice and will probably cause problems later when you're doing more things with the stack.
<br />
<br /><em>Always</em> exit your NMI with an RTI.
<br />
<br />- (Probalby the cause to the problem you're talking about):  You're never setting the scroll to any initial value... so the screen will be starting from a "garbage starting point".  So for the first 8 frames, the scroll is screwed.  I believe you left the PPU address at $3F20 when you turned the screen on -- so that's like starting with a Y scroll of 11.  It isn't until 8 frames in where you reset that scroll to zero -- which is why your screen is shifting up by ~11 pixels when the screen starts scrolling
<br />
<br />So I was right before -- your scrolling is correct -- and what you're thinking is "right" is actually a little off.
<br />
<br />To remedy this -- set the scroll before turning the screen on.  You can do this by writing zero to $2006 twice.
<br />
<br />- Also -- to avoid one frame of flicker -- you might want to wait until VBlank before turning the screen on.  If you turn the frame on in the middle of rendering time, the screen will start rendering halfway down the frame (will look weird).
<br />
<br />
<br />EDIT -- I'm too slow!  Q is too quick  ;D   and whoops -- I thought you were starting at $3F20 but Q is right about $3F10 -- which would only be a Y scroll of 3?

<br />
<br />Remember, $3F10 is $310 relative to that nametable. If he's using horizontal mirroring (which he probably is, otherwise he'd be seeing junk for the first 8 frames), that'll result in an effective Y-scroll of -40 (plus horizontally scrolled halfway).
