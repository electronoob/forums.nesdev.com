<br />I hear what you're saying.  I don't like the idea of destroying carts.
<br />
<br />If I get good at de-soldering, I really want to save each rom I remove.
<br />
<br />I forgot to mention I'm not using any video, just experimenting with sound right now (beginner). I don't need CHR.

<br />Thanks again!

On NTSC, without using sprite 0 or an IRQ to end rendering early, you can blast 160 bytes to VRAM every frame in a 16x unrolled loop and still have time to blast OAM. (At least it works in Nintendulator and Nestopia.) That can be useful for double-buffering each sprite's next frame of animation, up to 10 tiles at a time. If you want to do something like the background tile animation seen in SMB2 and SMB3, you'll need a mapper capable of swapping 2 KiB or smaller CHR banks, and that's expensive to reproduce because you can't just use the CPLD MMC1 clone.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">MottZilla wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If you have to use a real game please make sure it sucks and is common.</div>
<br />In that case, I've been told that UNROM (common as dirt) or BNROM (Deadly Towers) makes a good CHR RAM devcart. If you can't find those, you can put together a complete ReproPak from parts for under $20.

<br />Just use <a href="http://www.parodius.com/~veilleux/boardtable.txt" class="postlink">this document</a> for your board-checking needs. SMB uses an NROM board, as you can see in the list. You can search for other NROM games in there.
<br />
<br />The thing with NROM though is that there are 2 version, NROM-128 and NROM-256, one can hold 16KB of PRG ROM while the other holds 32KB. SMB uses 32KB, so it wouldn't be compatible with a NROM-128 board without modifications. To find out the size of a particular game, just download it after you have found it in the list and check the size of the PRG-ROM (FCEU and Nestopia can tell you that).

<br />There is a lot of overdump arround, and it is really easy to transform NROM-128 to NROM-256 and vice-verse, just deal with the A14 pin which should be VCC in the first case, and A14 in the second (duh).

<br />
<br />When I made my first UNROM cart, someone told me how easy it would be to convert it to UOROM, but it sounded so complicated back then, because I didn't understand shit. A while later I ended up doing the UOROM convertion, and only later I realized I was afraid of it before (I didn't even remember someone had suggest it to me), because I was really getting the hang of it.
<br />
<br />So I felt like I should mention how he'd be able to get the exact type of cart he wants, without worrying about rewiring, even if it is dead simple.
