<br />
<br />I have another question.  Sorry for my ignorance but I missed how you connect the cart for uploading the data into it in this current version. From the video (which I looked at it very fast) I didn't saw it. I think it's through the game port?  If that's the case, how can you do it with an older famicom, not av one?

<br />I'm also thinking one could use the NES Satellite (a 4-player adapter with infrared I/O) to make a wireless data connection to their PC.  Pointless, but funny.

<br />Having recently been gifted a NES Satellite I might just try that out with the Munchausen prototype, just for kicks. I have no idea if it'll work. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What socram8888 suggested is called the PowerPak. And it uses CF because SD's SPI is far slower than CF's parallel ATA without some hardware assistance. Besides, to make something a PowerPak, even if it's just for one mapper, you still need a boot ROM and an SRAM the size of PRG ROM. Munchausen is supposed to be cheap.

<br />SD SPI mode is really slow because you need to do a write for every read. In native mode you don't need to do that, with the drawback that you can read only 4 bits at a time. I haven't tried reading SD cards on the NES - but I have on the SNES, and I can read files at upwards of 200 kB/s with good cards and some minimal hardware assistance (no DMA or anything, just a kind-of latch that combines two 4-bit data reads into a byte that gets placed on the bus at the next write). I'm not familiar enough with the ATA protocol to say which is faster or easier to implement.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It might also have something to do that SD Card Association hadn't published the <a href="http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/pls/" class="postlink">non-confidential simplified specs</a> to read SD cards when the PowerPak was first designed. Sure, it could have been designed with the FPGA doing most of the grunt work in collecting both nibbles or even clocking SPI eight times. But I guess at the time, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA" class="postlink">parallel ATA</a> was better documented, being a subset of ISA.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just thought I'd weigh in here, since it's been a while. The first round of hardware will likely ship to its owners soon, after which I am happy to release instructions and code for building these. They are quite cheap parts-wise, and pretty simple to build. Given the cost (less than $30 in parts to build if you're thrifty, even less if you're building a bunch of them or already have parts) I think the capability is pretty good. MMC1 with CHR RAM and WRAM, and also two NROMs on the cart at the same time, and a simple USB interface.
<br />
<br />Release details and whatnot are coming. Thanks!
<br />
<br />EDIT: Oh, and one other thing, I do intend to offer pre-programmed Flash chips for people, as well as making completed cartridges. This stuff will be licensed under some kind of non-commercial license, but I won't really care if you have your buddy make you a chip and even pay him for it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Not like I can do anything, but it's nice to ask politely.
