<br />I used to have a lot of fun trying random 6-letter codes on all kinds of games.  Some of them are on the site above.
<br />
<br />About the only one I can remember was SSSSSS on Friday the 13th, makes the player invincible when walking.  Can't remember if it was 6 or 8 S's, but 8 S's was pretty fun on Zelda 2 also.

<br />
<br />That's because 8-letter codes are conditional, requiring that the changed byte first match a specified value. It means that a random 8-letter code will have around a 1% chance of even modifying anything.

I modified a 6-letter battles-instantly-end code for Final Fantasy into an 8-letter code, so that it would stop crashing the game in the room with the vampire. The code being several years old(almost to the point of the author's name being lost), it was no surprise it hadn't been fixed before.

<br />Ha!  <a href="http://www.retro8.net/ggco/badnewsbaseball.html" class="postlink">This site</a> has a submission from you for things like this.  I'm not sure if you submitted it to this site, or a previous incarnation, or a whole different site,  but I find it really funny because I just saw this page there today.  What a coinky-dink <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  I did notice that the same /ggco/ directory was in there though.
<br />
<br />hmmm... now that I checked out a few of the codes, I wonder if the site I posted just now ganked those codes, or if they were given to the webmaster.  I just gave that guy some material, so I hope that nothing on that site has been ripped off <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />Yeah, looks like it has all the codes from the older version of GGCO, where I submitted some originally.  So they've missed a lot of stuff.  I can't remember who ran the site, cracked8ball maybe.

<br />That site said the GGCO section was later moved to NESChedda.com, which is gone now.

<br />
<br />
<br />It was six S's on Friday the 13th and remember it only works when you are moving if you stand still you can still die. I remember playing that game a shitload and not being able to beat it then putting in that code and realizing it made you "almost" invincible. Now that someone has brought this topic up i'll have to dig up my old notebook with all the codes we made up over 1000 years ago, If I remember correctly there were some pretty good ones. Not to mention it was always fun to try and spell words like piss, ass, satan etc.. and see what it would do to the game if anything.
