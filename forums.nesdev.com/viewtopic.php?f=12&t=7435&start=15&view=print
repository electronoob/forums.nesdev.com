<br />Obvious missing niceties at the moment are PPU graphics viewers and the properties viewer for register states, the pure-Qt version has those.

You could make a PC game or go the MM9/10 route, but where's the challenge in that? (Yeah I know, completing a game in of itself is a challenge, but you know what I mean)
<br />
<br />Now the question I have, would you introduce intentional sprite flicker on the SNES to get that NES feel?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />I might be getting how you'd make a SNES sound engine or pretty much any sound engine in general.  The samples would be like the NES waveforms so your code would output the samples at a period/frequency which means you're not just playing pre-recorded songs but putting them together from a selection of waveforms.

I don't get you guys... If that's really the case, there are plenty of more modern platforms where you could be making games, I can't possibly believe it's just the lack of tools.</div>
<br />
<br />For me the interest comes from nostalgia and the idea of fulfilling my childhood dream of making my own video game.  I grew up with the NES, Genesis and SNES so I would be personally motivated to learn any/all of the three.  The NES got first pick because the nostalgia runs farther back and I happened to stumble upon this site first.  I don't know if I would have stuck with it if it weren't for this forum community, the good resources available (wiki, tuts) and tools like FCEUX's debugger.  When I started I looked into Genesis dev too and I couldn't find anything like that.  If I had, it's conceivable that I could have gotten into gendev (or snesdev) first instead.
<br />
<br />So I guess my point is that all three are equally interesting to me, but the abundance of tools/resources (and my ability to find them) made NES the winner.
