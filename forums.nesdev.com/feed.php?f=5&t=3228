Hey, that's true. Lemmings would be one great use of the touch screen, because the NES version with only joypad controls is limited to what your cursor can do.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed May 09, 2007 12:20 pm</p><hr />

Being a person that was skeptical of the PSP, I've ended up loving it.  If you don't want to read what I have to say about some of the games, just ignore the rest of the post and you'll still get the gist of what I have to say by the first sentence up there ; )<br /><br />When I had heard about Metal Gear: Portable Ops being out, I wanted it.  I never had the money to get the handheld though.  I then found out that Rondo of Blood was being ported and updated to the PSP, along with Symphony of the Night.  I've heard that it's supposed to be the Saturn version of SotN, but I've never seen anything definite with my own eyes... link if anyone has a reliable source that confirms for certain please : )<br /><br />Anyway, I ended up getting one so I could experience the sequel to Metal Gear Solid 3, and also purchase Rondo when it comes out.  I've found that there are some good games coming out, or that are out right now.<br /><br />Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins is one of them.  Man, this is one outstanding game!  It still retains it's difficulty, but has all kinds of cool power-ups and weapons added... it's not a port of the original G 'n G if anyone was wondering.<br /><br />I mentioned Metal Gear: Portable Ops above, and it's really a great game.  It has some strategy that you can apply to it by recruiting bad guys that you knock out.  Man, this game was really fun I think.<br /><br />Silent Hill: Origins is coming out, which is just what it sounds like.  I guess it's the first story of Silent Hill when it's all crazy.  The funniest part is that you're a truck driver haha  I find that hilarious personally.  The game looks great on videos so far though.<br /><br />Lemmings is another one.  I really want to try this one out, and it's soundtrack is even done by Tim Follin... that's a bonus for sure, as you all know.<br /><br />Gun: Showdown is one I want to get my hands on.  I loved the game on the Cube and XBox (never played PS2 or PC versions), but I've heard that there are some features on it that add to what it was.<br /><br />I've heard great things about the first Lumines games, but I've never played it myself yet.  We own it, but my wife is the only one to try it out so far.  I guess she got bored with it, but others haven't.<br /><br />That's all that comes to my head right now.  I really didn't think I'd like the PSP when it was out, but after getting it and some of the games, I'm diggin' it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=174">Roth</a> — Tue May 08, 2007 4:29 pm</p><hr />

I saw the Sega's Crush game trailer. It's a "new" engine, much like Paper Mario for Wii. It's annoying to me, but anyways it might be a time to be familiar with this new "style of gameplay"... I guess. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Ya, I'm starting to think about leaving PSP... thanks for the MegaMan games, dot.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Mon Apr 16, 2007 4:37 pm</p><hr />

The homebrew only works if you own a 1.5 firmware version; else, only a few versions accept "downgrade" through a "dangerous" software that could brick your PSP for ever. ^_^;;<br /><br />Since mine is newer than 3.03, I'm unable to downgrade it. Well, it's not my goal to run homebrew, but native PSP games only.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=39">Zepper</a> — Mon Apr 16, 2007 2:52 pm</p><hr />

Each single people I've heard buying the PSP until now did it to emulate NES/SNES/whathever games. Almost all games made for the PSP are remakes. I've heard of remakes of Tales of Synphonia, Final Fantasy 1&amp;2, Valkirie Profile, Final Fantasy Tactics, Breath of Fire 3, Mega Man, Mega Man X, Mega Man Legends and possibly others. I've not heard of any next gen game being released for the PSP (unless you love sports game, in which I have zero knownledge).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Apr 16, 2007 9:51 am</p><hr />
