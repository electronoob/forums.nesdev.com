And a person's word should not count as decisive evidence, so you can't just keep saying "He stole my money!" and expect us to believe that bunnyboy did this to you on purpose, especially since many of us on this forum have been doing business with him without problems.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, your word _should_ have been enough when you first told him about the returned package. I can't really tell if that was the case since I haven't seen any evidence produced by either side - and really, this is something that should be between the two of you. If you truly believe the things you're saying about him then I have to say that you come off as a bit paranoid. What happened was most likely that he sent you the wrong product by mistake, and then the two of you failed to resolve the error because of bad communication.
<br />
<br />My solution if I were bunnyboy would've been to refund you right away for whatever it was that you bought to begin with. And _if_ you also wanted a refund for the shipping charges you'd have to send the incorrect item back and make sure you get proper documentation from the post office (receipts etc).

<br />Let's say : 
<br />You pay for a dozen apples (not ipod of iPhone <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />, just apple). You go home and you get a banana ! You do agree to give back the banana because you pay for dozen apples, but... you come back home with your banana again !

<br />

<br />Yes, as I had mentioned in another thread, something like this, when done intentionally, is considered "mail fraud" and is punished harshly by the federal government (think FBI, or Postal Inspectors, who have a similar feared reputation).  Most crimes are covered by state laws, but since mail covers state lines, it's different.  A little US law lesson, if you were interested. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  No one who is sane would court that kind of trouble (so I believe it had to be a mistake), and no one wants to be out of their money either, so I'm hoping to see this resolved.

<br />
<br />Then we have Mumbly complaining about wrong product shipped to him. He tries to ship it back to the US, but wrong adress. Pissed because he has to pay the shipping costs once more. I start to.. hmmmmmmmmm weeeeeell.
<br />
<br />Then I google 'SNES Powerpak reviews' .. and start reading <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/340">http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/340</a><!-- m -->.
<br />
<br />3 people complaining about customer service.
<br />
<br />I'm not trying to bash bunnyboy, but.. It's getting more and more clear to me there's something lacking in the customer service arena at retrousb.
<br />
<br />Seems to me, IF something goes wrong, you'll have a hard time trying to fix it because of the lack of communication. *Crossing fingers*

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If it makes you feel any better, it's generally the case on forums and such with any hardware/software that people having problems with it tend to be the ones who post about it.  If it works out for someone, they'll just spend their time using it rather than talk about things being as expected.  So it's very normal to see disproportionate numbers of negative posts for a popular product, especially a complex design that can be a little, um, precarious without widespread testing "in the field".
<br />
<br />Also with Retrozone being a small operation, I'm sure it's easy for them to be overwhelmed when a major issue turns up.  Seems to be the case right now too.. on the SNES forum, Jagasian just mentioned that SNES PowerPak shipments are on hold due to a compatibility issue.
<br />
<br />A similar deal happened with the NES PowerPak also after it's release, when people had to send it back in to have some resistors added to the board.  That seemed to be handled well enough.
<br />
<br />Reasons like this is why I try to not be the early adopter of something as complex as this. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Heck, I still haven't ordered an NES PowerPak, which surprises myself sometimes.  But that's probably more because I'm saving my NES monies up for my own hardware designs, I can use every dime that I've got. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
