<br />
<br />Myself being schizoid, I don't gang up on people, and often rather make what i feel known; rather than keeping it in unless it is mass agreed upon.
<br />
<br />Aspies/Auties tend to run with the crowd while feeling that they predominating actually are intellectually superior; Schizoids damn well know nobody ever takes schizoids seriously, and damn well just end up p.o.'d a lot of the time.
<br />
<br />Neither group tends to have a fairly level headed mood; and without that neither group is intellectually superior over the other.
<br />
<br />So stop treating others like garbage and maybe this board can return to a non-hostile conditioning.
<br />
<br />there i just went ahead with you guys and voted 'no' just now to make the tally more clear.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am afraid that last part in your second to last post is simply part of human nature, most of witch is derived from one trait. The one that drives us to conform to the norms around us and to reject those that ether wont or can't. It has always been like this and it always will. 
<br />
<br />This has its good points as it keeps most people from doing too many crazy things and it allows us as humanity to act as a cohesive group. 
<br />
<br />Also it has its bad side, it is responsible for things like racism and many of the other darker parts of man. 
<br />
<br />Peoples tendency to apply a label to someone else and consider them beneath themselves whether this label be a slut, a freak, a loser, or a nigger. this list could go on forever as there are many reasons people reject each other 
<br />Most people will ether dismiss or try to do harm to people they consider one of these things. All we can do as individuals is be aware of this nature and try to be above it ourselves as the group as a hole will never change. 
<br />
<br />edit: btw those with Asperger's also find it impossible to be "One with the heard" as they cannot grasp social norms "normal" people often find them annoying because of this. They are perfectly aware they can never really be like everyone else. I do not have this condition but I am aware of what it means to have this burden.

<br />
<br />The primary model of my experiment that was most successful at allowing me to interact with others was forced ignorance. It took several years before I managed to convince myself to resort to this for any length of time.
<br />
<br />For this reason, I wish for those on this board not to give me a reason to vehemently ignore them. I find it pointless to have to avoid idiocy based on the person posting it. A little abstract anti-logic can keep one on their toes, but sheer idiocy is just annoying.

<br />Wow.
<br />
<br />Very, Very Deep.
<br />
<br />I had Asperger's Syndrome until my brain broke on December 18th, 2001 based on a journal I kept. For some reason my brain just went *foop*. My younger brother is Autistic, btw.

I don't urinate on those I consider inferior, simply because they're inferior, but I certainly consider some individuals inferior enough to not care about.
<br />
<br />Inferior intellectual and willing to learn is a newbie. Play nice.
<br />Inferior unintellectual and unwilling to learn is a moron who I don't care about.
<br />Inferior and uncommited to the mind is just someone ignorant. Poor them.
<br />
<br />I take the stance that if I can do something or understand something, then that should be a sign that virtually anyone should be able to concieve of it. I'm not so good that everyone else is less. I'm just enough to wonder how the hell people can be so stupid as to be too incapacitated to out-think me if the problem and solution is explained to them. Why do you need to try and pull a fast one on me, when there's either a better solution, or not a better solution. I don't have to like being outdone, but I'd at least like them to best me without changing the subject to how much I know, and killing the argument that way.
<br />
<br />As for labeling...um...yeah. I do that. It helps a lot. Intelligence can't be labeled easily, because of it's diversity. People who know some things somehow tend to learn more than those who resolutely stand by their infallibility. Ignorance is a lot easier to pin down, because it's either incidental and reversible, or a core belief. Which one I find determines if I think the person is wasting oxygen too close to me.

<br />I know first hand that many many people were PMing me on the same network #nesdev is on, on other networks, and even in public channels unrelated to NESdevvery about him being unbanned and being furious about it.
