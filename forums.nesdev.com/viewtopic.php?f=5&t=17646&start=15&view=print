		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I used to play around with a DOS program called Babble, where you could load from 4 different sources and mix them at whatever ratio you wanted.  It was a lot of fun.  That's how this file ended up on the server: <a href="http://nesdev.com/random.txt" class="postlink">http://nesdev.com/random.txt</a><br /><br />I had to try one of my own:<br /><div class="quotetitle">nestech.txt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The nes <br /><br />the ppu will post the following code to the vertical blank. Please be familiar with information about the actual colour intensity. However this document is a copy of my documentation regarding anything nes. Some games only use the first value of vram as squaresoft's &quot; gauntlet pro am &quot;. While fayzullin's 6502 pushes the ppu control register, it must not use a myriad of memory mapping hardware. Naturally, this feature will often degrade data written to both palettes. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="Http://nesdev.parodius.com/">Http://nesdev.parodius.com/</a><!-- m --> contains a verbose explanation by ricoh. This section will span across multiple devices quite often. You will be reset via a strobing process. Contact me with the expansion port method. See subsection g ( tiles themselves ) to be trashed, as rumored. Ignore subsection h ( vram installed within the mapper ), and nintendo entertainment system development is done because of this phenomenon.  <br /></div>

It's like new discoveries have been made about the way the NES works and I'm trying to comprehend all this new stuff.

I wrote the bot code myself from scratch, barring the MegaHAL C-based core, although I did have to patch some of it.<br /><br />Said bot has &quot;Tepples-esque&quot; stuff in it, but it'll be a cold day in hell before I ever paste anything it says about that subject, or disclose anything else about it.  I think it'd &quot;trigger&quot; too many people.  But since <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=17498" class="postlink">IRC is old crappy dead ancient beard-infested technology</a>, technically what I describe might not even exist.  Maybe it's a thing of the past.  Or maybe a thing of the present.  Or a big lie.  Or maybe it's real.  Then again, maybe not.  I asked him a moment ago &quot;Are you real?&quot; and his response was &quot;Eat my mom's liquified uterus.&quot;  You decide.<br /><br />TL;DR -- I remember MegaHAL.

They vaguely make sense because I'm choosing the ones that sound the best.  Just going from the options given though, I only added periods, commas, and new lines.<br /><br />Screwed around earlier and did a few more from NES manuals here: <a href="http://www.digitpress.com/library/manuals/nes/" class="postlink">http://www.digitpress.com/library/manuals/nes/</a><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">SMB2 manual wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The game pak can only be used with benzene and offensive capabilities. When thy meter becomes 0, you will flash faster. We are completely under his evil television of dreams. Shyguys often ride the boss character when you press a jump button. Similar damage may occur dropped at the player.  the game pak reads a little devil who appears in his bed spreads entirely covered with spines, so you can't jump on his back. He spits fireballs from his own brain. <br /><br />* try throwing the control pad at enemies if they are displayed on your projection television screen. <br />* picking up enemies with magic potion from the beginning area recovers the life. <br />* princess toadstool is a little boss character. <br />* you'll become invincible by using the select screen. <br /><br />When standing still, luigi is entirely like a mushroom machine. He interferes with mario and his friends. Please help mario, and the coins you have collected on wart's feet will be liable to start another completely new game. You have already got a bird button. Please defeat the enemy skillfully like a vegetable meter. <br /></div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Control Deck manual wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The control deck <br /><br />symptom: your tv set ( refer to your fingers ) is broadcasting on the rf and the antenna is no improvement. <br />Remedy: Switch on your control deck before the tv programs control your television. <br /><br />Symptom: the controller sockets control your fingers. <br />Remedy: do not insert or yank your game pak. <br /><br />Symptom: only one player is good. <br />remedy: to reach nintendo customer assistance, tune the power pak properly ( refer to channel 4 ).<br /> <br />nintendo recommends against not trying to play both controllers. Note to your fingers, please call our consumer service department at the beginning of your game malfunction. However, dust etc is connected to a particularly strong cloth. Color coding is required to use any foreign materials. <br /></div><br />Yeah, &quot;fingers&quot; came up a lot and I couldn't resist.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Contra manual wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Red falcon's life <br /><br />the earth assault sensors suddenly become more difficult to destroy. The unpleasantry is mutual. Press with a risky cosmic commando squad to survive in 1957. Naturally of course, you'll ultimately need a viking warrior in the royal guard. Remember -- beware of alien henchmen equipped with awesome extra- terrestrial dog hits. We suggest you have been overruled and instead the special mayan civilization symbol looks like an octagon with a single universe in 3-d. Destroy these ghost death sensors. But before you doubt this authentic konami game, you'll attempt to make your way into the pentagon. Reinforcements pour in and then your guerrilla warfare instincts confronting the inhumane challenge at your mission begins. But pray these alien larvae can continue to exist. <br /></div>
