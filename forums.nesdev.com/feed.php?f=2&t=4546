Actually, both the NES and the SNES aren't as nostalgic for me. They are nostalgic, but not as much as other people here, I'm sure. The Gameboy is by far the most nostalgic system for me. Some day I'll learn to program for it. I just really like the NES, and I thought it'd be simpler to program for than other consoles with all of it's limits (I was sort of wrong). One day I plan to move onto the SNES as it's a lot more capable. I really am not so concerned about not being able to make graphics that aren't amateurish as much as I am about making code that I think is running perfectly but since there aren't many debugging tools, there's really some small glitch that will cause the program to completely crash in one spot. Since I've only been programming for about 3 years, and I've only done the 6502 and a tiny little bit of QBasic, I don't think I'm ready to move on to that quite yet.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Tokumaru, tepples : Instead of accusing me to complicate things, you should better read what the author asks instead of posting wrong things.<br />Especially since I mentionned a couple of times that you should be mitaken horizontal and vertical and you completely ignored that.<br /><br />@Secret sevice dude : I'm really sorry but you'll have to read the whole thread ignoring all tepples and tokumaru's posts, because they were assuming you were scrolling horizontally all the way down there.

I was indeed thinking horizontally all the way... sorry. I guess that the word "parallax" simply feels related to horizontal movement. So even though I read all the posts, my brain simply turned "vertical" into "horizontal". Sorry about that.<br /><br />But he doesn't have to ignore everything. He seems to have got good ideas from the discussion anyways, and that's what counts. By now he already knows how to update the tiles and knows that name table updates will be necessary.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Nov 08, 2008 2:09 am</p><hr />

Ah, so you will in fact use vertical parallax as well... Well, it seems like you'll need name table updates after all. Sorry, I missed that.<br /><br />Have you figured a good way to redraw only the necessary rows of the name tables? The fact that there are pieces of foreground covering the mountains will probably make this a little harder, because you'll either have to skip them or redraw them. Redrawing is probably easier.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Nov 07, 2008 11:03 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Both of those games does horizontal parallax effects, not vertical, and it loops forever.<br /></div><br />I believe I mentioned those requirements for it to work as I suggested. Well, maybe not the lack of vertical effects, but yeah, I was completely disregarding vertical parallax effects. This would make things extremely complicated.<br /><br />Like tepples suggested, there are games with horizontal parallax effects only, while vertical scrolling works as usual, and that doesn't look bad at all. I guess we tend to forgive the lack of attention to vertical scrolling. Even in Sonic games you can find several levels where the background doesn't move up or down at all. I can't remember if there is any that scrolls at the same rate as the foreground though.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The montains in the background doesn't look to loop forever in his screenshots, which changes a lot of things !<br /></div><br />Of course they look like they loop! They are only interrupted by foreground objects, and there is no problem with that. You'd need name table updates only if there were background interruptions, but the background looks very contiguous to me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, I think you mentioned to me once, Tokumaru, the idea of doing CHR RAM updates when there's free time.<br /></div><br />Oh yeah, but this is probably not appropriate for parallax effects, as the movement would look pretty jerky when updates failed to be executed on time, because the foreground would still scroll, meaning that the mountains would be moved the same amount as the foreground, and you'd cancel out half of their movement only on the next frame... they would appear to flicker or shake back and forth, really bad...<br /><br />This idea was originally for updating animations of objects... Since objects rarely have their graphics changed every frame (it's more like every 4 frames for 15FPS animations) a delay of 1 frame to load the new graphics shouldn't really be noticeable.<br /><br />@SecretServiceDude: Sorry, I missed the part where you showed you'd need to change 5 tiles and just from looking at it I assumed 4 (although you could easily reduce it to 4 if you shifted the graphics down a bit, unless you have a very specific reason to use that particular vertical position). But still, with the single plane trick we're looking at 40 bytes, pretty doable. Like Celius suggested, that's so little you could even buffer the bytes in zero page, so that it'll be quicker to read them, although that's not a requirement if you have the VBlank time to spare.<br /><br />If you are feeling like optimizing it really bad, you could take advantage of the fact that the gradient has a few lines that alternate, so you could keep the 2 patterns in 2 different registers and perform a few writes before needing to load new patterns, saving some time. And the bottom of the mountains tiles have a few lines that are always filled and need nu updates at all! Of course this is specific to the mountains, and if you plan to use the same code for different graphics you'd better stick with full tile updates. You could have optimal copying routines for each type of graphics, but that sounds a bit extreme if you're not really short of VBlank time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Nov 07, 2008 9:45 pm</p><hr />

Oh yeah, I actually plan to use sprites for clouds too! This would be good as you could place them behind tree tops. to make it look really layered.<br /><br />I really dislike some really stationary backgrounds where it looks really really flat; especially ones with skies. Using sprites for the moon and clouds really eliminates this garbage wall paper look. Though sometimes that adds character to a game, I generally just think it looks bad.<br /><br />EDIT: About making the foreground, that is a really great idea. Having a foreground like you mentioned really makes it look 3Dish. In my opinion it has way more effect than making an extra background layer. Both in combination will really make your game look great (assuming you pull it off right).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Nov 07, 2008 7:07 pm</p><hr />

Also, since it's only 32 bytes, you might even be able to set aside an array for that in Zero Page. So it would actually be 224 cycles to do it.<br /><br />Also, I think you mentioned to me once, Tokumaru, the idea of doing CHR RAM updates when there's free time. Say if you're not updating a row or a column of tiles, then you could update the CHR RAM data. Though this might not be such a good idea in situations where there are always updates for whatever reason.<br /><br />Though if you are scrolling vertically, you'll want to modify the name table as well as the tiles. It just didn't look like that's what you were doing.<br /><br />You know, you're not just limited to working with the BG and shifting tiles. Sprites operate on a coordinate system, and can go behind the background (except for color #0). Perhaps you might benefit from doing <em>something</em> with sprites. I'm not saying make a mountain out of sprites (that's a bad idea, especially since you only have 64 sprites and 8 on a scanline), but you might be able to do something with them. In my game, you'll enter a cavern-type area, and there'll be some icicle-type rock formations hanging down that will be made of sprites, and there'll be parallax for them.<br /><br />Another thing I might do is for something like a large moon, make the circular part out of sprites while filling the center in with solid BG tiles. This would require only writes to the name table, but it'd probably require a lot of sprites to completely cover the solid BG tile edges. You'd want to do this with 8x16 sprites because it's big, but your biggest issue would be worrying about the 8 sprite per scanline limit. If you have the circle part of the moon flickering when the BG doesn't, it'll look pretty bad.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Nov 07, 2008 6:08 pm</p><hr />

After 8 rotations, all tiles have to be shifted and we go back to the first rotation. But think about it: if instead of updating the name tables you kept rotating the patterns for 8 more steps, a 16-pixel wide area would be covered before name tables updates are needed. Now, imagine that if the repeating image is in fact just 16-pixels wide, like SSD's mountains, redrawing everything shifted 16 pixels is totally unnecessary, because it'd look the same. I suck at explaining stuff, but I hope you got it.<br /></div><br />If he applies what you say, he'll get a mountain rotating itself in the background and that scroll down just as the foreground does. In order to matain the mountain in place, it should be raised in the nametable as the same rate the scrolling raises up.<br /><br />Or are you talking about having enough tiles in CHRRAM to cover the whole 30 rows of the nametable ? That would mean 60 tiles should be reserved for the effect (but only 4 of them updated at a time), but yeah no nametable update needed. I guess that's a good idea after all. It'd just be a shame computing the adress of the tiles that needs to be updated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Fri Nov 07, 2008 2:36 pm</p><hr />
