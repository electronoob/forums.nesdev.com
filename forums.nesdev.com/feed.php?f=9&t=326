Does it have to be NES? I'm trying to build a Game Boy flash cart and it'd really help if you could flash a program onto the chip for me. Once it has the base program I can use that to reflash through the link cable.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sun Jul 17, 2005 9:12 am</p><hr />

Get them from ebay ? Well, it's easily said, but :<br />1 - I'm not suscribed to ebay, and I can't suscribe because I've not yet any cash card (I'll probabily have one later when I'll be 18 years old or something, but for now...)<br />2 - Shipping in Switzerland may cause problem for many products.<br />3 - You have to suscribe in function of your country, and the page for Ebay Switzerland is in german, and I don't undersand german (I shall record to another country or ?)<br /><br />About making my NES universal : I ask myself if cutting pin 4 of the lockout chip on the card would work. So there would be both locks, and there is no reason to have it different that both keys (the locout chip doccument say it so, but i hasn't been confirmed). Also, I could lend my homebrow game to friends and so on, and they would work on their NES. Else, I could effectively replace them by an european lockout chip (by the way I ask myself if SNES lockout chips are compatible or not).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Jun 07, 2005 9:54 am</p><hr />

Get them from ebay! (I never pay more than a few bucks a piece)<br /><br />You know, you can use NTSC carts, you just have to swap the lockout chip with a PAL one. Or, I believe you can just cut off pin 4 of the lockout chip inside the NES, I know it works for NTSC board, not certain of PAL, anyone?<br /><br />As far as I know, the MMC chips are all the same, regardless of territory.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=45">drk421</a> — Mon Jun 06, 2005 6:37 pm</p><hr />

Thanks, but my main problem is personally not to burn Eproms, it's just to found NES cartidges. I don't know if anyone there has the same problem, but I've in head scince 9 months to burn a FF2 rom from a Legend of Zelda cartidge (Metroid or Kid Icarus would also works with few modifications). Thoose are the only 3 communs SNROM games released in PAL. I check for any cartidge of those 3 games scince a while, and I'm really unable to find any of theese. The only NES game I can still find are all NROM or TLROM (several SLROM and UNROM, too). Any other board is simply IMPOSSIBLE to find, at least in my country.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun Jun 05, 2005 1:22 am</p><hr />

I will program EPROMs (for free) for people who want to make their own NES carts to run their OWN programs, as a service to the NESDEV community. This is for homebrew code ONLY. DO NOT waste my time asking me to program hacked games or commercial games.<br /><br />You may supply your own EPROMs, or you can buy them from me (my prices may be rough sometimes).<br /><br />I may lend out my own hacked carts if you send money or other collateral, if you don't want to take the time to modify a cart. (desoldering the old mask roms and rewiring it).<br /><br />Make sure you contact me before sending anything.<br /><br />You must pay postage both ways!<br /><br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:drk421@gmail.com">drk421@gmail.com</a><!-- e --><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=45">drk421</a> — Sun May 29, 2005 9:58 am</p><hr />
