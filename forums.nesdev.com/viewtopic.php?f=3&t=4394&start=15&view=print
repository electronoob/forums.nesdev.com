Rendering two movies simultaneously would probably be nicest but would also require a bit more architecturalish code changes than I'd like to undertake at the moment.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  (As an aside, how would you treat audio in this configuration?  One game goes to left speaker, one to the right speaker?  What if stereo sound isn't supported?)  I think a good, easy compromise would be an option to alternate monitors between movies.  I'll see what I can do!   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
<br />
<br />In a scenario with more than one monitor, if you do show more than one movie, the sound will be an issue like you said.  In that case, I would:
<br />
<br />- disable the sound or
<br />- Select witch monitor as sound priority
<br />
<br />The second option seem strange unless you can specify that on monitor X, always the game you like the most play and this is the monitor that you want sound from.
<br />
<br />But for now, if it can alternate between monitors or you can select to be on only one monitor, this is already more than enough <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />I agree. That would make a nice one.  Only issue (?) is you can only run it with dual monitors <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Here is the screen saver homepage: <a href="http://www.ubernes.com/nesscreensaver.html" class="postlink">http://www.ubernes.com/nesscreensaver.html</a>

<br />I think in both case, I was playing in one of the games shown on the screen. I had 4 of them at the same time, using direct draw, NTSC filter. I set dual CPU.  I use system pool for buffer. I don't scroll any text.  I don't think I did any other settings.

<br />Edit: I just recorded a bunch of umf files of me playing Super Mario Bros. I started recording at each level's intro (World ?-? screen) and stopped at every death or at the very end of each level. (after the flagpole fanfare) It's not stellar play, just me messing around, and I did most levels up to somewhere in World 7 where I got a game over. Some levels there isn't a video for, because I screwed up with the recording. If there's interest I'll try to do one for each level, and upload them. It's kind of cool to have the screensaver play random Super Mario Bros. levels.

<br />
<br />The way I understand it, the movie has many "checkpoint" in it. So if you had only SMB in your screen saver with the full movie of the game, it would show random part of the game every 1 minute (or the setting you set).  Is it what you're looking for?

<br />Thanks for trying out the screen saver!  I'm not happy with how cumbersome the GUI is for the video stuff so while I'm redoing that I will try to get these features added.  The grid spacing will be very easy to add, but the show top/bottom scanlines will be a tougher nut to crack for tedious implementation reasons.  
<br />
<br />Banshaku's post is correct in that a single SMB movie with checkpoints at each level could be displayed as a big wall of SMB levels just the same as having a single movie for each level; six of one a half dozen of the other.  Along those lines, a "no-warp" play-through of SMB would be a really nice addition to the online movie gallery to go along with the speed runs already there.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />If you can create a debug version that could catch and write logs about the possible error, I could always try it.

I re-installed my os recently and it ask for specific DLL (MSVCP71.DLL, maybe will ask for another one once I have this one).  I checked on the net but I cannot find any VS C++ redistributable for VS2003. They are only available for 2005/2008.  Maybe they came with dot net 1.1 framework but I didn't re-installed or have no intention to do it.
