		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I recently got my hands on a Gimmick cartridge in hopes that it would work with my TNS-HFC5 and TNS-HFX4. Unfortunately, all that happens is that when I turn it on, the chip's noise starts playing, crescendoing, regardless of what nsf is playing. During nsf's with actual 5B expansion music nothing changes, and there aren't any square waves or tones. Is this a lost cause? If it is, is there some other possible way to have a 5B chip play back audio?

I've played tunes through my Gimmick! cart by hotswapping or using the CopyNES.<br /><br />Does the TNS-HFC5 or TNS-HFX4 actually support the 5B? I can't read Japanese very well, but the website description seems to suggest that they do not support the 5B cartridge directly, but instead offer an option for an equivalent chip on the TNS board?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@rainwarrior<br />Thanks for the reply. What is hotswapping and CopyNES? I'm completely inadequate when it comes to hardware or software admittedly I'm just a middleware-using musician so I appreciate all you guys are doing.<br /><br />Edit: My Japanese is very subpar, but I agree that the website and directions seems to indicate that the YMZ249 is the only compatible 5B hardware it was designed for...<br /><br />@jsr<br />Is it possible then to do it with something like this? <a href="http://applesorce.b.osdn.me/2011/09/27/%E3%82%B5%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BD%E3%83%95%E3%83%88%E3%81%AE%E6%8B%A1%E5%BC%B5%E9%9F%B3%E6%BA%90%E3%81%AE%E5%B0%81%E5%8D%B0%E3%82%92%E8%A7%A3%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E9%B3%B4%E3%82%89%E3%81%99%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95/" class="postlink">applesource</a> These directions say that this schematic renders the cartridge compatible with the TNS-HFC3. I definitely wouldn't want to tamper with the actual Gimmick cart, maybe I can try my luck at finding a 5B in some cheaper Sunsoft cartridge...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hotswapping is writing a program that copies itself to RAM and runs from there, running it on my Famicom, yanking out the cartridge (i.e. powerpak), then jamming in Gimmick. The program will still be running (usually) and I can then get it do stuff with Gimmick in place.<br /><br />CopyNES is an NES modification that lets you attach it to a PC and control it from there. You can use that to play NSFs through your NES via computer control, rather than running them from a cartridge. If you put Gimmick in, you can use its sound hardware.

CopyNES sounds like a very powerful tool, though it's a bit outside of my range of money, time, and skill at the moment (I'd have to buy everything but the Gimmick cart, and I'd probably feel obligated to spend a ton of time messing with and learning about the other functionality.)<br /><br />Also, have you by chance looked at that schematic from the link I posted? Do you think that will work if I somehow find another Sunsoft 5b? Do you know how rare it is to find in Batman/Gremlins2?<br /><br />PS: One more question, have you beaten Gimmick? haha it's so tough

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not the best person to ask about the schematic; I'm pretty slow with electrical engineering stuff. I'm sure there are a lot of other people on this board who could evaluate it more quickly and accurately than I can.<br /><br />I don't know how often 5B were used in other carts besides Gimmick. I've heard of a 5B appearing in Gremlins once before, and this article is the second one I've seen (and also a Batman). I have no idea if this is like 50% or 10% or what, but I think you're more likely to find 5A or FME-7 in them.<br /><br />I've beaten Gimmick many times! I even took a video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZX6DYe3ffU" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZX6DYe3ffU</a>
