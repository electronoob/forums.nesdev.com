I imagine wireless having a lot of problems and delays in gameplay, and the games that needs to be controlled not through buttons, but through movements will always do the wrong movements, etc... Also, having to handle the controller vertically and having the B button on the back seems to suck to much.
<br />Of course, I may be totally wrong. Also, the controller could serve as a NES controller through backward-compability (I'm not sure how this'll be done), but it looks like just too big and not handy.
<br />
<br />The main reason why I bought a PlayStation and PS2 insted of N64 nor Game Cube, is of course the fact that there is none Final Fantasy games nor Dragon Quest games for, but also the fact that they went totally wrong on the controllers. The N64 controller is really odd, the GC one is horrible, so I let you guess about the Revolusion.

<br />I had forget about Chrystal Chronicles, but I haven't heard any good from it. It sure have several good games, but not enough to be worthy.
<br />Why play NES games though PocketNES, GBA2GC adpatator instead of emulating them directly on your PC with better resolution and accuracy ? Or better yet, play them on the real NES, but this isn't always advisable for rare games or untranslated games, unfortunatly.

<br />You mentioned <em>Final Fantasy</em>. Two out of three <em>Final Fantasy</em> games for NES/Famicom hardware remains untranslated.
<br />
<br />So what would you use as a mouse on the PS3 or Xbox 360?

I think they're just trying to release the worst console ever made, and for now they all got the rights paths. Even the PS3 controller looks horrible, after the great PS1&amp;2 controller, they just didn't have to touch it. Or better yet, making buttons a bit curved like on the NES, directionnal arrows "fusionned together" like the NES, with the exact design of the PS1/2 controller would make the best controller ever made. They just not have to search that far.
<br />
<br />I got a new PC for not too expensive, and it runs all emulated games at full-speed and with decent graphics (turn on interpolation to get TV-like graphics).

<br />
<br />Not as such - I think Nintendo is going to clean up here.  Especially once  developers figure out that you can have one of these controllers *in each hand*.  
<br />
<br />I do know that multiple mice in Windows all affect the same cursor, almost like the mouse events all tumble into one master mouse event queue.  I'm sure you could hack something up under Linux to maintain multiple mouse cursors simultaneously (imagine four mice plugged into a USB hub), but to what end?

I think they've started to get the right idea with taking games to a whole different level of gameplay, instead of following all the other companies and taking the consoles to a whole different level of power.  Power is good, don't get me wrong, but if I'm not having fun, I'm not playing.  The controller might seem a bit weird when you first think of it, but I seriously don't see them releasing an entire console with a controller that doesn't work very well.  I was pretty skeptical of the DS when I first heard about it, but now it's one of the two consoles I play more than any other (NES being the other of course <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ).

<br />I have U-Force too, but I have to disagree: that thing is bloody useless.  Maybe that's more of a symptom of being a third-party product with no games to back it up, but its just too awkward to use.

<br />It doesn't suck. It's pretty damn cool. We rigged up pretty rocking printf-based 2-player versions of "Tug" and Joust using just the actuators in the controllers.
