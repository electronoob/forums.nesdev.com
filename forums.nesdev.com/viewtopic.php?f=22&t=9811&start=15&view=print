You don't want to sue them anyway (you're not the MPAA...), so you just want it to be the minimum of difficulty to make it awkward for them to extract the image but still 100% reliable for you. Adding the visible watermarking means now they don't get a copy identical to the master, so there's no urge to hoard, and maybe a little bit of name-and-shame.

If it doesn't detect it, just make the game bad to play. Like earthbound did. Stupid hard, no final boss, erased save data, make &quot;random&quot; crashes, etc. I'd say random crashes triggered by a random program so it happens minutes in to the game would be great as you can make it as hard to trace as possible, and allow it to take a while to do and such.

Now, we can make them to do useful things in a custom emulator. Say, we'll add operation stz addr. In source code of the game we can have a macro that will do it either normal way, with few opcodes, or with this new custom opcode. It will be used all around code, and with simple recompile we can have a normal version and this 'protected' one. Even if a hacker will know what the new opcode does (by decompiling the custom emulator or just by a guess), he'll sure be able to hack an existing emulator to support it, if he aren't too lazy. But to make it work on the real hardware he will have to replace the opcode. Since it does job of few opcodes, a lot of code shifts and inserts will be needed, or a full disassemble to recompile - that's just too much of work and will take quite some time even for someone who is brave enough to do it.

Also, for those on the forums, I've decided to stick to my guns with the you decide how much % that goes to the store, even if that number is 0% for any number of copies you sell. It is more important for me to see a thriving NES indie development scene than it is for me to break even. I cannot however affect what Ouya takes (30%), so pad that ouya store tax into your prices.<br /><br />Also for pricing you can reference: <a href="http://ouyaforum.com/showthread.php?749-How-much-do-you-think-you-would-be-willing-to-pay-for-the-average-OUYA-Game" class="postlink">http://ouyaforum.com/showthread.php?749-How-much-do-you-think-you-would-be-willing-to-pay-for-the-average-OUYA-Game</a>
