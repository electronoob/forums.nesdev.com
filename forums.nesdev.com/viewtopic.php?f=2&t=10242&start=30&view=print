		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm so excited to hear that folks! Thank you!<br /><br />I've come to a bit of a decision point that I'd like some input on. For inline assembly, should I just pass the inlined text directly to the assembler, or have a basic assembler parser that can convert the labels and addressing modes so it can generate cross-assembler code? Honestly I'm not sure which one would be better. Passing the text verbatim would be the most powerful, but also the most error-prone from an end-user's perspective.

Note that you need to assemble and link against lib\crt0.s to get a complete .nes file.<br /><br />Before release 0.4 I am going to have an automated regression test in place so I won't be wiping egg off my face so often <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Last go-around I tested what I thought I was going to release, but accidentally CD'ed into the wrong directory for the packaging step.<br /><br />Anyhow, I guess I'm going to go with verbatim assembly blocks for now. Once I get that worked into the file parser and get comparisons done I'll have 0.4-rc1 ready and can start building some NES demos with it. Exciting stuff <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

It sounds like the easier option from your end as well.  It gives the user the power to do anything they want in assembly directly.  And while it does allow them to make more errors, it's not for the 'beginner' anyways.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey,<br /><br />I haven't been posting in this thread now, and I haven't the time to test the compiler right now, but all I can say is that it looks *extremely* promising.<br /><br />All I can say is that I hope that shifts and function with multiple return values will be supported.<br />Shifts because they are extremely annoying to deal with in 6502 assembly.<br />Functions with multiple return values because when I code in assembly I use this all the time, and I feel handicaped by high level language which only allows a single return values. I never understood why this became a standard, there is no logical reason behind this. Except maybe the usage of function within an expression, but I think outside an expression a so called &quot;high level&quot; language should be able to return 2 or more values.<br /><br />What I use especially all the time in assembly is a subroutine that returns some value in A, and a validity flag in C. That means for example, C=0 means no error, the result is in A, and C=1 means there have been an error, and A contains garbage. I never found a way to replicate this in HLL, exept using the sign bit and returning -1 on error, but this only works if you don't use all the number range in the return value.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for the encouragement Bregalad! You'll be happy to know that bitwise shifts are currently supported. However the number of shift positions must be a compile-time constant. Additionally, multiplication and division are not supported at all.<br /><br />I was thinking about multiple return values for a while now. Because subroutines can't be used in an expression, there's no reason not to support them. But because there was no ask for them, I didn't put them on the road map. I've added this to the road map for version 0.7. It's mainly a change to the parser. Most of the code generation needed for this is already there.<br /><br />As for things like statuses in the carry bit, this is the 10% of assembly optimization that the language does not attempt to implement. Hopefully the multiple return values will satisfy the need, and if the performance overhead is that important then it probably should be in assembly to begin with <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The way I envision using this tool is to write most of the code in the high-level language, and performance-sensitive parts like the vblank kernel in assembly. Then if I hit a performance bottleneck during development, I will profile it with Nintendulator and go to optimizing, with inline assembly being the last optimization step.

Thanks for listening to my blabbering anyways.<br /><br />I can see why you don't add variable * variable multiplication and divisions (too many different implementation on them, and picking one over another is going to start a flame war anyways), but variable * constant and constant * constant should definitely be supported (constant at compile time). variable / constant is not too hard to do either.<br /><br />I can already see this language mixed up with both assembly and C in a big project :<br />- Time sensitive things : Assembly<br />- Medium sensitive things : This language<br />- Complicated logic not sensitive to timing : C
