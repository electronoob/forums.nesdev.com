The current implementation is strictly a UI-side feature and it would actually require a lot more changes to be able to properly highlight all writes (as there is currently no tracking of PPU read/writes in the debugger).  I'll add it to my list as a future improvement idea, but it might be a while before I can get to it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">gauauu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Is there a way to make it start in a random bank/banks? (which I realize is slightly complicated because it has to work for each banking scheme).  It would be nice to be able to properly test to make sure my stubs to jump into the first bank are all working right.</div>I've added an option for this in the emulation options: &quot;Randomize power-on state for mappers&quot;.<br />It only has an impact on some mappers - specifically, those you mentioned + most of the mappers covered by tepples' holy diver tests (since I figured those were also most likely good candidates for homebrew).  It will randomize startup banks, and also other things like prg/chr banking modes or mirroring (when possible). It's far from perfect, but it should at least help just a little bit when trying to check for initialization bugs.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi.<br /><br />I've been enjoying 0.9.6 so far. Such a good tool for development.<br /><br />One tiny feature that I keep wanting to have would be to be able to jump to the memory viewer by right clicking on a Label in the debugger. I use debug info, so pretty much every symbol is there and often I am &quot;what does this thing contain again?&quot;.<br /><br />The ultimate would be to have 2 options (if applicable):<br />- Show in CPU memory<br />- Show in ROM/RAM memory (useful when a bank isn't currently mapped).<br /><br />See attached image for a terrible ms-paint mockup.<br /><br />-Mat

These kinds of actions would probably be useful in a number of other places, too (e.g right-click in the code window, hex editor, etc.)  It shouldn't be too hard to add these (not just in the label list, but in general), I'll try to get around to it soon.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do we want to count the ROM addresses relative to the start of PRG ROM (e.g. $000000-$01FFFF) or of the iNES image (e.g. $000010-$02000F)?</div>Mesen currently has &quot;PRG ROM&quot; and &quot;CHR ROM&quot; addressing types for breakpoints/labels that count bytes based on the start of a particular memory type, rather than the offset in the .nes file.
