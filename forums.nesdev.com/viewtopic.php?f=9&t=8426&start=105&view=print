And sure you can still buy 74HC, even a few which might be PACKAGED recently (not that I believe ic2ic), seeing how it's the most popular legacy logic family along with 74LS, but that doesn't mean the dies are still being produced (they are separate businesses). I doubt that anyone but NXP actually offer it. 74VHC (mid 90s) seems to be the last logic family for which '175 were produced, and those are definitely discontinued and unavailable. 74HC, which date back to 1982, are only available due to prolonged EOL.
<br />
<br />If you look at modern logic families you'd see that '175 aren't being made because it's no longer a desirable part to use along with fast-food integration, and that's my point: it's unsustainable. I guess that hardly matters here considering the small run, and of course the fact that the logic in this thread is nonsensical and random part selection would fail just as well.

The ONLY exception is if you KNOW that both chips hold the same data for the current address.   That shouldn't be true for CHR ROM and RAM so the answer is NO you can't do that, you must disable SRAM if you're not using it.
<br />
<br />EDIT:  My suggestion is stop trying to make sense of the chinese board and copy it.  What you think you "know" about it you probably don't.  Just design it from the ground up properly.  Unquestionably this thing won't work the first time you power it up.  If parts of your design are copied from the chinese board and you really don't understand the design fully, and you'll never be able to properly troubleshoot it to fix the problem.

<br /><strong>2 FARID</strong>
<br />'175 have Q and /Q, so you need just one bit to control CHR ROM/RAM without extra invertors.
<br />
<br />And could you please use another image hosting
<br />
<br /><strong>2 infiniteneslives</strong> it's very simple design. Very simple. And <strong>MotZilla</strong> gave more than enough information to build it.

<br />
<br />No, it seems CHR side is different than PRG side. Originally /OE and /CE of CHR-ROM and CHR-RAM have their own lines :
<br />/OE --&gt; CON17 --&gt; CHR /RD
<br />/CE --&gt; CON56 --&gt; CHR /A13
<br />
<br />I don't think it is possible to hijack those lines and control them. Anyway I used 157 to solve this issue.

<br />So by logic and reasoning, I would listen to what kyuusaku is trying to say ... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
