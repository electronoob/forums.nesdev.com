		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a fool.  A moron.  I failed to heed the warnings that the PPU had some solder points that needed tons of heat to work, and rather than be more careful, I got in a hurry.  I tore up traces, and broke pins off of my PPU.<br /><br />I have since gone through as carefully as I could and jumped all of the damaged traces I could find, and installed the dip socket that came with my NESRGB board - but I must admit that I am in over my head.  I get a black screen when powering up - but if I use my multimeter to check the composite video signal, I get what amounts to 1Vpp, which if I understand it correctly, is a proper voltage for a composite video signal.  I get black screen from composite video, svideo, and RGB.<br /><br />I have installed the PPU into a second socket that it will permanently live in, dremeled part of the package itself away and soldered wires to the exposed copper to repair the chip as best as I could.  I get 5v at the NESRGB board.<br /><br />Here's a bunch of pictures of the disaster I have created.  I am acting out of paranoia at this point checking continuity all over the place, using this pin map:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tUMvwwt.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Right away I'm concerned, because I don't have continuity from pin 3/D1 on the PPU to pin 10/D0 on U1 (sram) - but I have bridged continuity D1 to D2 on SRAM, and D2 on the PPU has continuity to those two points - however no continuity D1 to D2 on the PPU itself.  Very odd.  :\<br /><br />Anyway - here's the pictures of where I am with this:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imgur.com/a/8EgIZ">http://imgur.com/a/8EgIZ</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Halp.  I can't tell if I have killed the PPU or not.  I don't currently own an o-scope or logical analyzer, and from what I can tell a replacement PPU will run me $60.  At that point I could almost afford to just buy a new one and start over.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><br /><br />What can I do here?  Right now I'm just matching up pin names and testing continuity out.  Finding things that leave me confused, like the PPU diagram I have shows pins 14, 15, 16, and 17 as R, G, B and I assume sync (it's black).  Yet from my pictures, it looks as though 14 and 15 were bridged, and 15 and 16 were bridged, and all 4 have continuity to ground, so that's what I reproduced as best I could.<br /><br />As you can see, I'm floundering here.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

Looking through the rest of the suggestions to figure out how to proceed, because after I put the chip back into the NESRGB, and then installed it into my top loader, I still get a black screen - tested composite, svideo, and rgb.  Same results across the board.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm part of the way through this process, but I get stuck going from the &quot;V&quot;RAM at U4 to the PPU.  I'm looking at the block diagram, and I'm getting a little sidetracked.  Here's what I've sorted out so far:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">VCC all check out.<br />PPU&nbsp; 40<br />CPU&nbsp; 40<br />U1&nbsp; &nbsp;24<br />U4&nbsp; &nbsp;24<br />U9&nbsp; &nbsp;14<br />U7&nbsp; &nbsp;16<br />U3&nbsp; &nbsp;16<br />U2&nbsp; &nbsp;20<br /><br />Grounds all check out<br />PPU&nbsp; 14,15,16,17,20<br />CPU&nbsp; 20,30<br />U1&nbsp; &nbsp;12,20<br />U4&nbsp; &nbsp;12<br />U9&nbsp; &nbsp; 7<br />U7&nbsp; &nbsp; 8<br />U3&nbsp; &nbsp; 8,15<br />U2&nbsp; &nbsp; 1,10<br /><br /><br />“W”RAM to CPU - all but two?<br /><br />U1&nbsp; &nbsp;CPU&nbsp; &nbsp;BUS<br />&nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; 11&nbsp; &nbsp; A7<br />&nbsp;2&nbsp; &nbsp; 10&nbsp; &nbsp; A6<br />&nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9&nbsp; &nbsp; A5<br />&nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8&nbsp; &nbsp; A4<br />&nbsp;5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7&nbsp; &nbsp; A3<br />&nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp; A2<br />&nbsp;7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5&nbsp; &nbsp; A1&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; A0<br />&nbsp;9&nbsp; &nbsp; 28&nbsp; &nbsp; D0 <br />10&nbsp; &nbsp; 27&nbsp; &nbsp; D1<br />11&nbsp; &nbsp; 26&nbsp; &nbsp; D2 <br />13&nbsp; &nbsp; 25&nbsp; &nbsp; D3<br />14&nbsp; &nbsp; 24&nbsp; &nbsp; D4<br />15&nbsp; &nbsp; 23&nbsp; &nbsp; D5<br />16&nbsp; &nbsp; 22&nbsp; &nbsp; D6<br />17&nbsp; &nbsp; 21&nbsp; &nbsp; D7<br />19&nbsp; &nbsp; 14&nbsp; &nbsp; A10<br />21&nbsp; &nbsp; 34&nbsp; &nbsp; WE -&gt; R/W<br />22&nbsp; &nbsp; 13&nbsp; &nbsp; A9<br />23&nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; A8<br /><br />U1 18 (CS) to U3 4 (1Y0)<br /><br />PPU to CPU<br /><br />PPU&nbsp; &nbsp; CPU&nbsp; &nbsp; BUS<br />&nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 34&nbsp; &nbsp; R/W<br />&nbsp;2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 28&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D0<br />&nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 27&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D1<br />&nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 26&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D2<br />&nbsp;5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D3<br />&nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D4<br />&nbsp;7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 23&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D5<br />&nbsp;8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 22&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D6<br />&nbsp;9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 21&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D7<br />10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A2<br />11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A1<br />12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A0<br />18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 29&nbsp; &nbsp; CLK&nbsp; &lt;- unsure, no continuity<br />22&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; Reset<br />------------------<br />25&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17&nbsp; &nbsp; A13 |<br />26&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 16&nbsp; &nbsp; A12 |<br />27&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15&nbsp; &nbsp; A11 |—These all fail<br />28&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14&nbsp; &nbsp; A10 |&nbsp; for me.<br />29&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A9 |<br />30&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A8 |<br />------------------<br /><br />AD0-AD7 and ALE go nowhere?</div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Starting to make a little more sense out of the block diagram.  I think.<br /><br />PPU pin 25 should have continuity to pin 37 on the cartridge connector, right?<br /><br />Wanted to sanity check myself, because I seem to be missing a whole lot of connectivity.  According to this block diagram, I should have a direct connection from PPU pin 29 and U2 pin 1, but I have nothing.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://console5.com/techwiki/images/5/54/NES-001-Schematic---CPU%2C-PPU%2C-RAM%2C-CIC.png">https://console5.com/techwiki/images/5/ ... 2C-CIC.png</a><!-- m -->
