		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, I presume Quietust's CopyNESW project has had better maintenance than mine, and most users should probably use that. USBCopyNESBlue at this point is really just a personal fork that I play with when I want to try something new with my CopyNES, which is not very often.<br /><br />I made some improvements to the VRC7 patch tuner, but really that was just to take another pass at matching the internal VRC7 patches. There's not really much point for anyone else to use it anyway, unless you think you can improve the patch accuracy further. The patches I made are <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=9141" class="postlink">available here</a>.<br /><br />I also added an APU stream player, but that's another thing that's probably not much use to anybody but me. I create register write logs using NSFPlay and then play them back as a stream sent over USB. I've mostly used this to test the audio behaviour on expansion carts. Probably most people wouldn't get much out of it (especially since it can't do DPCM samples).

I've only recently become aware of the indie/home brew scene. So I've been using google and forum searches to get up to speed.<br /><br />As an engineer am fascinated and impressed by what folks have managed to accomplish with equipment pushing 20 years old.<br /><br />Knowing (from other threads I've turned up in searches) that there's some ungrateful haters out there that have pushed some folks from the scene I thought I'd give folks some kind words and encouragement when the work they've done or documented helps me out.<br /><br />I apologize if I have adversely affected anyone's forum viewing by doing so. At the time I thought I had good reason.
