However, gloves prevent you from wearing rings and activating fingerprint scanners, and takes up part of your maximum carrying weight. Gloves can be used for other things too.</li><li>Another idea of computer game is a cross of Tetris and pinball; the flippers could also move the tetris blocks left/right, and then you can nudge the table to make the ball bounce off of the blocks in certain ways, which are worth different number of points; maybe four lines at once gives you a ball saver.</li><li>Pokemon game for Z-machine.</li><li>Sokoban with geometry that can be changed using consumable items.</li><li>A game using the actual positions of the planets, dwarf planets, sun, moon to affect the rules of the game (possibly in real-time!).</li><li>Roguelike where any kind of creature in the game is suitable as player characters, NPCs good/evil/low/chaos/etc is not based on their species, any class can be chosen by anyone, including multiclassing, magic is really strange and involves prime numbers and other mathematics (category theory?) somehow, and killing the same kind of creature many times reduces the XP bonus gained from it each time so that eventually it even becomes <em>negative</em> (and becomes <em>even more</em> negative over time).</li><li>Platform game where various things displayed to you are delayed by different amounts, requiring various tactics to get past things that are unknown (especially since it can be random in some ways).</li><li>Pokemon game where the computer is psychic, always knows how the dice are going to fall on this and the next turn, and always knows your command before it decides its own command; furthermore, some things don't always work as you might expect.</li><li>A game for the Famicom with enough commands that you need all of the keys on the keyboard, as well as the mouse, and one standard controller.</li><li>an grand theft auto ish game where you play as an NKVD agent in alt-history xinjiang. (This one is from someone else; not me)</li></ul><br />Maybe I will program it (or perhaps not), or anyone can expand on it; however, please don't restrict anyone else from making a game like the same thing.

The ghosts are furious at this desecration of what could be considered their home, and are trying to usher your sorry inebriated ass out of there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Few years ago I was actually making a kind of reversed Pac-Man game for SMD where only the power pellets available on the level initially. The goal is to eat all the ghosts, but when Pacman eats one of the power pellets, the ghosts are scared so much, so they start to leave shitty pellets behind them, and Pacman does not like eating the shit, he could eat some, but changes the color from yellow to green and gets game over. So the player has to catch ghosts avoiding chasing them directly, and choosing safe, 'shitless' routes. The game was in more or less playable prototype state, I have forgot why I abandoned the project and not sure where it is now (backuped somewhere).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another computer game idea I have is based on a diagram I remember that someone drew for me once. It was a directed graph; the nodes were drawn as faces, some of which had wavy lines above. The faces without wavy lines represented good monsters and the ones with wavy lines represented bad monsters. Probably additional kinds of pieces should be added, though.

Each piece had its own sound effect when it entered &quot;next&quot;: for example, the S was two ascending tones, and the L was a noise burst and a low tone. Each time the piece moved sideways, the game would beep with a pitch corresponding to the horizontal position of the piece's center. I pulled it off my web site in June 2012 when I learned that <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/12/06/21/1219206/us-district-court-game-elements-in-tetris-clone-infringe-tetris-cos-copyright" class="postlink">The Tetris Company had successfully sued someone</a>; at that point, various <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/08/02/26/1859249/tetris-creator-claims-foss-destroys-the-market" class="postlink">things that Alexey Pajitnov had said against free software</a> made me feel like disassociating myself entirely from Tetris.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Duck Hunt style game, but you have to use the joystick and you have to push the correct button A/B/C according to the A/B/C writing on the target, and if the cursor collides with a bomb then you lose (even if you do not push a button)</div><br />EA's Boom Boom Rocket anywhere near close?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Game where you have some magic points that you can use to change the entire laws of physics and game rules</div><br />There is Eversion, a side-scroller whose levels have points where the player can slip to a higher or lower level of grimdark, and blocks' properties change at certain levels. There's also some sort of Mario/Tetris mash-up called &quot;Tuper Tario&quot; that I played on some Flash game site where the player could switch between dropping blocks (as in Tetris) and jumping on them (as in Tetris'D).

(I have actually thought of idea of platform game where the controls will be randomized! I was playing HOCUS once; I know of the cheat code FEELGOOD (someone showed me) to full heal (although I didn't use it after that anyways), and I decided maybe there should be another cheat code FEELBAD which randomizes the controls.) (Another note, which might possibly be of a few interest, is the controls I prefer on a platform game on a PC is to use left and right shift keys to move, space to jump, and ZXCVBNM,./ to shoot. This is unusual, but I prefer it.)
