<br />
<br />Those pirates don't concern themselves with copy rights.  ARRR
<br />
<br />The games are illegal to sell in the US.  There isn't anything wrong with a clone console technically.  As long as they don't claim to be Nintendo making it.

It's not like there are copy write police walking around your local mall looking for this stuff.  Nintendo would have to see it, and then decide it was worth filing a lawsuit over.  And it's probably not worth it to them for that little shop at your mall.<br /><br />You can ask but you're not going to get an intelligent response.  The dude selling them probably has no idea what you're talking about.  He's just some dude doing his job selling junk, it's not like he's the pirate.  He probably didn't even decide what should be sold at his store, he may as well be the dude flipping your burger at McD's.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Tormenter wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Who cares?

<br />
<br />Nintendo cares.  They also sell drugs everywhere, does that make them fine?  That 20+ year old game is still making Nintendo money today with virtual console sales.  And the Mario/Zelda names are still being sold on current games, and the pirates making those obviously haven't been licensed by Nintendo.

<br />Ask anybody who has contributed to NORML or to NORML Foundation. Like the war on drugs, the war on sharing lacks universal popular support, as the recent PROTECTIP protest has shown.

<br />
<br />I want to know how you will tell apart an real console with Ricoh chips from one with clones. I don't think you can do that if it's one of the early clones with discrete PPU and CPU UMC chips ...  At most you can put a prompt on the screen and ask the user if they noticed that the audio duty cycle is wrong.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />

<br />
<br />Replacement connectors for older systems. If you want to play games in the first place, you'll need a working system. I doubt I'll displease anybody who doesn't even have a working NES. Plus, there's 80 million NES's out there. 80 Million. I myself even have 13. How many others have is irrelevant also, because they're NOT rare. They're old and uncommon, not rare by any means. They're also not broken, their connectors just suck. Buy a new one. And if you don't have an NES and still urn with a passion to play my game and will pay good money for it, I'd be happy to put it on Playchoice 10 instead, heh. The final step if you really really want to play it and can pull 10x more wanting than an NES version of any game of mine, I'd possibly make an HTML5 port.
<br />
<br />And to make it not work on clones, I'll have to look into different things ways, but open bus is a problem on lots of them I have heard. Other than that, I'm not really sure, but the open bus problems will be checked for in my non-testing programs. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />
<br />When you read a open bus address  on a machine without pull-up resistors, you have the data lines floating so it might pick any random value (usually it's a vestige of whatever was on the bus at the last cycle).
<br />
<br />When you read an open bus address on a machine with pull up resistors (high value resistors on each data pin of the bus to the +5v) you get $FF every time you read, regardless of last value on the bus. The pull-up resistors will stabilize the bus and keep all lines high when nothing is connected to it as an output.
<br />
<br />That's the physical explanation for your "open bus issue". <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />As I said, the NES has a line of 10k resistors pulling the bus up. The Famicom does not. The clones copy the Famicom, not the NES. 
<br />
<br />That's my point.
