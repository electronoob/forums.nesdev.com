		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm currently starting an NES game.  It will be my first game, not counting numerous SMB hacks.  At the current point of development, I still basically have some raw code.  I wanted to ask:  Should I attempt a lightgun game?
<br />
<br />To my knowledge, lightgun games work by clearing the screen on a single frame w/ the sprite(s) white, then the gun sets a bit on the controller register if it see's white during the cycle's duration.  This is simple enough, but would programming the entire game be more difficult than programming...say...a platformer?  Thought I'd ask people who have far more experience on the NES hardware than the people on the vintage-computer.com forums...
<br />
<br />Oh, &amp; by the way, I'm staying here.  Bookmarking *\search.php?search_id=newposts on my bookmark toolbar.   Want to absorb all the knowledge I can here, then, maybe some day even help out some people if I stay long enough.
<br />
<br />EDIT:  BTW, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://st3phanie.com/stealingyourbandwidth/tothrashbarg.zip">http://st3phanie.com/stealingyourbandwi ... shbarg.zip</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />VERY raw code BTW.

<br />Hum... I wouldn't say so. It might be easier actually. I've never coded a lightgun game, but to me it seems that the simplicity of detecting if the gun has hit a white sprite (as opposed to performing software collision detection between objects and all) can make it all easier.
<br />
<br />However, "lightgun game" is a pretty vague term... The fact that the player has to shoot things with a gun is just a small aspect of a game. Like, recently, we were discussing about making raycasters (pseudo-3D first-person-shooters) that used the light gun. Of course those would be harder to code than Duck Hunt, because the player moves inside this pseudo-3D world. Duck Hunt's world is nothing but some static bushes in front of you.
<br />
<br />So in the end, yeah, it depends on the rest of the game. Platformers have to deal with the complexity of decoding level maps, scrolling, complex physics, and things not commonly seen in lightgun games, so I think most of the time they'll be harder to code.
<br />
<br />BTW, welcome! =)

<br />Do you guys think someone w/ not that much 6502 ASM experience could pull this off?

<br />Uh dude, wake up... the Sci Fi channel has invested in the new Dr Who, and they are currently on Season 3, they're only about 3-4 months behind BBC-1.  Sorry to burt your bubble though.  So that also means you have to get SciFi's permission as well as BBC... even harder

<br />Anywho, I plan to base the game off of the 60-80 era episodes.  Each level with a new doctor, perhaps.  Hell, maybe I can even have levels for side characters like Susan!

<br />What would you guys find nessicary for an audio driver?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Quite a few music engines can be split roughly into three layers:
<br /><ul><li>Song </li><li>Phrase </li><li>Instrument </li></ul>
<br />
<br />The lowest layer of a music engine is the instrument driver. It implements the command "play note <em>a</em> using instrument <em>b</em> on channel <em>c</em>" in terms of writes to the PSG registers, which are CPU $4000-$400F on the NES. Often, an instrument is defined in terms of volume changes, timbre changes, and possibly pitch changes.
<br />
<br />The next layer is the phrase. It implements the command "play phrase <em>a</em>, transposed up <em>b</em> on channel <em>c</em>", it interprets musical opcodes, and it issues commands to the instrument layer. For example, opcodes in a phrase might represent "piano, octave 2, eighth notes G A B c d e fs g".
<br />
<br />The next layer is the song. If you've ever heard the main theme from <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, you'll notice that it repeats parts. The song engine handles starting and stopping phrases, based on opcodes that represent things like "at 5:1, start phrase verse-melody on channel 1".
<br />
<br />Under such a structure, a sound effect may be implemented as an instrument or as a phrase.
