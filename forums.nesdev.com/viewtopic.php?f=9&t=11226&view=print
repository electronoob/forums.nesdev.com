Now I would like to find out what part of it is damaged and fix it if it's easy to replace or otherwise at least save the working parts.<br /><br />So I wonder if anyone knows of any good ways to approach this problem, or maybe some general hints or guidelines when dealing with this kind of stuff.<br /><br />He says it shows a white screen when turned on, if that info is any useful.

Trigger on /INTRAMSEL, and, when R/W is high, see if any of D0..D7 change mid-cycle. If it doesn't, then that RAM might be damaged.<br /><br />If it plays music and makes sound effects in response to user input, the PPU RAM might be damaged.<br /><br />/ROMSEL is also on the cartridge, and /INTRAMSEL and /PPUSEL are also on the RAM adjacent to the CPU and on the PPU respectively.

But that doesn't involve the entire cartridge connector, and you might be even able to piggy-back it on the internal RAM.

The 0xEA NOP would only guaranteeably execute 5398 NOPs (because it started executing at $EAEA) before it could slide into a KIL instruction somewhere. 0x44 (NOP zpg) would at least give you a few more cycles before it slides into RAM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, a little update. I realized I could just borrow a connector from one of my other NESs (I know, pretty obvious, should have thought of that from the start). So I did just that and started it up to see if what he told me was correct. And it was, kind of. But it wasn't white but rather gray. I compared with the white screen of a working NES and it's not the same. And it is not blinking. Don't know what conclusions can be made from that but maybe you know.<br />I'll try the oscilloscope later but I don't have it around anymore since I only borrowed it and the owner needed it now. I will be able to borrow it again soon though.

Which must mean that the CIC is ok i guess.<br />I made it stop blinking and then did some tests with a voltmeter.<br />Vcc showed a solid 5.00V so that's fine.<br />/RST was 4.99-5.00<br />/NMI and /IRQ showed 4.94V. (could this be interpreted as they are triggered sometimes and the measured voltage is some kind of mean value?)<br /><br />I also checked the CLK pin which I'm not sure is ok.<br />What happened was that the measured voltage was 2.xx(don't remember exactly)<br />and the screen turned green. I don't know why, but I got afraid I had done something bad.<br />Eventually the screen went back to gray after I had done some more measuring.<br /><br />And I don't have access to the oscilloscope yet but hopefully soon.<br /><br />@Memblers: thanks for the tip, I'll definitely consider buying one.
