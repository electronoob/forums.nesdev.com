So far, two episodes are available, and it looks like there will be 4 more.<br /><br />In the series they interview several musicians, like Hip Tanaka, Masashi Kageyama (composer for &quot;Gimmick!&quot;), and Akio Dobashi (composer for &quot;Lagrange Point&quot;), as well as other people involved in video game music in one way or another.

The commercial games that were made often involved <strong>manual effort</strong> -- few tools, often just entering raw hex data -- compared to the stuff that floats around the 'net today.  (Rephrased: we have better tools now than they did 25 years ago, yet the games made 25 years ago on a whole were still substantially better... ;-) )

Other than that to match the quality of a licensed game, you'll need to somehow find two other people in the same city with the appropriate skills and find enough money to pay them for a year.

Alter Ego is a recent(ish) homebrew I can think of that had a nice soundtrack.

It might depend on the programmer, but a game written in hex (to actually work in an NES game) sounds considerably worse than something made in Famitracker, which the most that can be done is simply playing the NSF while a very basic screen is shown.  Allegedly Famitracker is a highly inefficient way of making NES music, although the results are much better than something written in hex.  I might be wrong though, since apparently Shiru made a tool for FT music, and thefox made MUSEtracker, which is said to be oriented more towards game development.  Let's not forget how so many composers absolutely insist on using expansion audio, perhaps to hide their own inadequacies.<br /><br />That said, I hope they get to interview Norio Nakagata, who among other things, composed the music for (Samurai) Zombie Nation.  Zombie Nation's music is quite unlike anything else made for the NES, not to mention it's probably the NES game that uses the DPCM channel almost all the time, for drums, snares, orchestra hits, basslines, and even a &quot;Yeah&quot; sound.  These samples would later be used in the Japan only Doki Doki Yuuenchi and Summer Carnival '92:  Recca.

The efficiency comes from:<br /><br />1. Careful composition with redundancy/repetition.<br />2. Exporting the data into an efficient form.<br />3. Diagnostic information about the export to inspect the size of data.<br />4. Lightweight driver implementing only the features you need.<br /><br />The NSF files produced by Famitracker are not the most efficient. It's feature-packed music driver is about 5k of NES code, for example, but there is nothing stopping you from writing an alternative driver, and an alternative export. Shiru did it with Famitone. I did it with my own project. The efficiency of the data depends on your custom export, it can be written to recognize and diagnose other kinds of redundancy. For example, you could write an exporter that automatically recognizes arpeggio patterns instead of building instruments for each. You could make a custom percussion instrument that interrupts triangle briefly while playing noise, so that in the output data it's only 1 &quot;note&quot; for each drum hit, even though in the Famitracker data it would be 2 notes across 2 channels. Etc.<br /><br />Famitracker gives you nearly complete control of all aspects of the NES APU, and immediate feedback with it. It's really not lacking at all as a way to produce efficient, game-shippable NES music.

You don't have to try and guess everything a user can do, you can tell the user &quot;use this pattern, and it will export this way&quot;. This is also a place where diagonstic output helps to see if you did it right, and you might even put up a warning if you can recognize &quot;wrong&quot; ways to do it.<br /><br />Alternatively, yeah, you can just live with not hearing the full effect in Famitracker and do the export frequently to make sure it still sounds good.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Sik:  There shouldn't be any difference between the two, maybe they added/omitted some songs in the Japanese version?  Some games that I do know have different soundtracks for the US and Japan are Casino Kid and Wall Street Kid, the former has the music played with different pitches, not sure about the latter.<br /><br />@Tepples: I suppose the Sunsoft games use the bassline almost every chance they get, but what I meant was that Zombie Nation plays DPCM samples so frequently, it doesn't give the DAC channel a break.  And Klax has a few samples, but they're very sparingly used in the first place.
