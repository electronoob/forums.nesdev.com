<br />
<br />I'll need to make some changes to the board, so I need to do yet another prototype run after I do that..
<br />
<br />I might be able to cut some costs by using surface-mount parts, it's something I'll have to pursue so I can use the better 18F PIC without raising the price for everyone.  So the PRG-ROM should be PLCC-32 instead of DIP-32 in the final version.  Hopefully it won't be much harder to build, I've never soldered surface-mount chips before.

<br />
<br />The previous way I had planned was having the adapter inside the cable hooked to the PC, it could plug into the cart, or the NES controller port (or various other 5-volt systems).  This would also mean the connector could serve as an expansion port with 4 I/Os, 5V+, and GND.
<br />
<br />Another way I'm thinking of doing it is just integrating the serial adapter onto the cart.  It should be cheaper since I wouldn't have to make 2 boards.  The PCB thickness requirements are different, so they can't go in the same run unfortunately.
<br />
<br />So, I'm wondering if it matters either way to anyone.  The external adapter is pretty nice to use with any cart, any system with a couple I/Os, etc.  But if noone would end up using it much outside of Squeedo, it might be better off being integrated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Another month passes.  Sorry it's been so long, when I first started this project (nearly half a year ago already!) I really thought I'd be done by now, heheh.
<br />
<br />But everything is progessing smoothly.  My design has worked 100% as expected so far.  If everything goes well, I should have a final (for real) prototype in my hands in early March.  The next revision has some changes.
<br />
<br />EPROM support is dropped, it'll use FlashROM pinout only.
<br />
<br />On the software side, some good news if anyone is looking forward to doing some hacking with the PIC mapper.  The design will be expanded to have 256 registers instead of 32.  At $5x00-$5xFF.
<br />
<br />On the hardware side:
<br />
<br />MIDI-in option.  Replaces RS232, so you can only use one or the other without a little soldering (or a switch maybe).  The devcart version will be geared towards RS232 only.
<br />
<br />The TTL-level expansion port is being dropped in favor of an RS232-level one.  But VCC will still be provided on the port, in case anyone wants to power their own expansion circuit (and RS232 transceiver).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I know you developed the Squeedo as a sort of super-MMC5-like cart and it is intended for future game development, but how easy is it to hack existing Famicom/NES games with common simple mappers, so that they can run on the Squeedo?  If there was a tool that could auto-hack common games to run on the Squeedo, that would help sell lots of Squeedos, which means that more non-developers have Squeedo carts and therefore game developers can just release a ROM and people can run it on their Squeedo.

<br />No, it would help Nintendo shut the project down for contributory copyright infringement. Look what happened to Bung when it sold GBC copier products. I'd suggest making two builds of a game: one designed to run in, say, UNROM and one designed to run in Squeedo.

The biggest thing is the nametable memory, Squeedo has extra VRAM where most games expect (and often require) there to be none.  If you modify a ROM's header to enable "4-screen" mode and it looks screwed up when it runs in an emu, that's roughly how it might look on Squeedo (in the best case).
<br />
<br />I'm sure it could sell more if it ran whatever game someone wanted it to.  But if my design will be successful, I'd be a lot happier if it was successful as a completely original product.
<br />
<br />So yeah, I am kinda going out on a limb here.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />But anyways, it'll be able to run some existing ROMs as a matter of course.  Most of the current homebrew games/demos aren't very picky about the type of cart it's on.  I'll have some way to load them, because it'd be kinda dumb to require people to reassemble all the homebrew NROM programs to run them.  UNROM and CNROM are some other types that might work.  Still depends on the screen memory and scrolling though.

<br />
<br />So NROM, UNROM, and CNROM?  It lends your new hardware legitimacy as a real piece of NES hardware if it runs even a few official NES games.  I know you probably hate being asked, but how much will a Squeedo cost and when are you going to start selling them?

<br />
<br />As for when I can start selling them, the only true answer is "as soon as possible".  I've got to finish up my production version of the board, make sure it's totally bullet-proof (if not, rinse and repeat..), then the real production can begin.  Maybe in a couple months, but that's very, very optimistic.

<br />Once I get it assembled and test it, I'll let everyone know how it went.

<br />
<br />I just relised something :
<br />If any simple multi-directionnal scooling code is designed to work with 4-screen mirroring, it would in theory work with both horizontal and vertical mirroring, and also on 1-screen mirroring. When you're drawing new data to the "same" mirrored name table, or if it's another one, it makes hardwarely no differences, exept some gliches that could appear. So a programm written for squeedo's 4-screen mirroring could also work on a standard cartidge.
<br />Also, how do you want to use the PIC as a mapper ? I didn't got it wery well.
