Would a general CNROM script work, or would I need to use something more particular to the game's specific chip? As for Fantasy Zone, does anyone even have a script for SUNSOFT-1 PCBs?

Can’t imagine a bad script damaging the cart either.  What do you mean “pass out”?  The boards/carts aren’t getting inserted backwards accidentally are they?  Units purchased from me after fall 2016 have resettable fuses to prevent this issue especially with snes.  Do you have more details on the boards that had this problem (photos etc).

Bought my kazzo in early 2017, pcb is dark orange so it's the model you're describing.<br /><br />The boards are the standard 3-4 globs PCB you'd expect from 90s pirates. I can take pics but I doubt you'll be satisfied by them as there are no signs of damage or anything they just stopped working after.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah only thing I can think of is something about those pirate carts being easy to get into latch up due to hot plugging the cart.  I'm not sure what the original kazzo firmware does with it's i/o when it's idle.  My firmware disables output drivers and enables pullups which should help prevent from powering chips from the i/o lines while inserting.  If the original kazzo firmware doesn't do this, that could be causing latch up I suppose.  With this, I would say when using the original kazzo firmware one shouldn't insert the cart while the programmer is powered on.  Disconnect USB cord, insert cart, connect USB cord, dump cart or whatever, remove USB cord, then remove cart.<br /><br />I don't see how a defect could be causing something like this.  And yes you've got the version with the resettable fuse, you can see the little green fuse next to the USB connector.

Because I remember having to flash it with the original because it wouldn't with the preinstalled one.</div><br /><br />No all firmwares I've ever written, or will ever write will be completely incompatible with anago/unagi.  When I first started tinkering with the kazzo I tried to adapt anago/unagi and the original firmware to meet my specific needs but the lack of documentation and high level of abstraction made it easier to start from scratch.<br /><br />I've been working on a new firmware and software release over the past year that's intent is to make anago/unagi and original firmwares obsolete.  All operations can be controlled by lua scripts on the host side allowing as low level of control as desired.  I'm hoping to release in the next 2 weeks.  But it may take me another month or more to get the mapper scripts built up to the breath of mapper support that anago/unagi currently supports.<br /><br />Additionally I'm releasing a new hardware design which is completely incompatable with anago/unagi and original firmware as it's updating to an ARM core (STM32F070) and hardware USB 2.0 along with support for additional consoles.  But all software and firmware releases I plan to make will be compatible with new (STM32) and old (AVR) hardware.  So I'm not ceasing support for old hardware, but I have no plans to provide original hardware with an AVR mcu which will run the original firmware and anago/unagi.  I'm hoping the new software and firmware will make those program obsolete but we'll see how that goes.
