<br />I'm trying to make the layout fit into 80 columns (CSS: 40em). <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/em/" class="postlink">Longer line lengths tend to lead to eye strain</a> and cause problems on smaller screens. Toward that end, I've put a maximum width on &lt;img&gt; elements so that they don't widen pages. I'm also trying to make the WWWThreads and phpBB layouts consistent: my WWWThreads archive uses exactly the same layout as what you see here.

<br />In most cases it probably wouldn't. If you're looking for a specific topic started by a specific person, it might come in handy (it might be easier to just google it in that case). The only other situation where it might make a difference is that good questions tend to get good answers. If you know who's better at asking good questions, it could help to see who started the topic.
<br />
<br />I'm not advocating one position or the other, just trying to answer the question.

If I'm a new reader and I remember some specific author that had interesting threads, I may read them. So it's quite subjective but still, why removing information that was already there? Now I have to click a topic to find who wrote it. Some information has more value for some people than others.  The last person that posted has less value than the author of the thread.
<br />
<br />As for the layout, I think that personally is thinking a little bit too much (eye strain thing) for just some scrapping a website.  My reasoning behind the layout is more an emotional one than a practical one: I want it to be close to the original has possible.  For new readers, it may makes no difference but for us old "geezers", there is some memory attached to those threads.  
<br />
<br />That's only my opinion though! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />That is useful "but" that doesn't allow me to check which thread a user started, just what he posted. If I can look page per page and check who made that thread, in some case it is better I think when I browse a specific forum.  This could be a personal preference. Is it something hard to add to the scrapper?

Going forward on the new forum, I think the best option would be for users to make wiki accounts and upload the images to the wiki. I'll have more to say after my own experience with QuestyCaptcha continues. QuestyCaptcha is similar to the Q&amp;A CAPTCHA described <a href="http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=2122696" class="postlink">here</a>, and from my first week of using it, it appears far more effective than Google's reCAPTCHA.
<br />
<br />As for browsing topics whose <em>first</em> post is by a given user, I had no idea this was such a desirable use case. I can get the information with one extra JOIN in the get topic or get posting history query; the problem is just how to present the results.

<br />
<br />I'm not sure if we are talking about the same thing though. Right now, what I'm talking about is that I want the list of topic in an archived forum to contain the name of the author beside the title. Adding an extra search feature to find all topics from a poster was not what I meant, although interesting as a concept.

<br />
<br />You must be thinking of imageshack or tinypic.  I've never heard of Photobucket deleting pics unless they're offensive.  I have an actual Photobucket account that I can log into to view pics I've uploaded and albums I've set up.  It's not paid or anything, but I believe as long as I show a certain amount of minimum activity it won't be disappearing anytime soon.  Nothing's been randomly deleted from my account since I opened it 8 years ago.
<br />
<br />However it is true that the best possible archive would also contain the pictures so they can never expire.  A lot of potentially-useful threads here are already wastelands due to linked pictures and files having expired long ago.
