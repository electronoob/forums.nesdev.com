The picture generated by the NES (which fills the 4:3 screen) is 280x240, with 24 pixels at the side of each scanline in a border that's normally hidden in overscan. Thus the pixel aspect ratio (the width of each pixel divided by its height) is 8:7. If you want to extend this to HDTV wihle keeping the same pixel aspect ratio, you end up with about 373x240, with 352x240 of actual picture inside the border, or 44x30 tiles. If I remember correctly, this is about the same res you'd get out of a TurboGrafx-16 in &quot;medium resolution&quot;.<br /><br />The other option is to make your game for 256x160, letterboxed, and then expand a 280x180-pixel window of this to the 720p or 1080p frame. You could have it draw the status bar over the playfield on 16:9 HDTVs and out of the letterbox frame on 4:3 SDTVs.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Tue Feb 03, 2015 1:22 pm</p><hr />

I'm probably going to do the same (or use 427x240) if my actual NES game ever makes it to other platforms. 256x240 is not a great resolution to scale to HD (1920x1080). Would need a border, or very horizontally scaled pixels.<br /><br />If the levels are actually larger than 256x240, there's not much reason not to. Wouldn't work for a game like Battle Kid, though.<br /><br />Edit: Though scaling could affect how enemies spawn across the two versions, which is something I struggle with.

So based on that I think it's an artists job to get the most out of what the NES could do, not what the NES is characteristic of (like with chip tunes).<br /></div><br /><br />Well, there's what you would do with a VRC6, what you would do with unrestrained use of an NES, and what you would do in the context of an actual NES game. I've made music in all of these situations, and for me it's a very different approach on each of these.<br /><br />1. The first approach is just trying to make some good music, inspired by the NES sound and somewhat related to it, but this really isn't about proving what the hardware can do. Does anyone really care what the limitations of VRC6 are? It's awfully powerful, not much of a constrained music platform, just a fun set of sounds to work with.<br /><br />2. The second approach involves proving it could actually be done on the NES, but at the same time you're allowed to sacrifice all other considerations for just the music. This stuff doesn't sound like NES game music, for very good reason, but at least the constraints here are severe enough that it's a lot of fun to try and see what you can do within them. Doing this well really involves getting to know the hardware very well.<br /><br />3. The third results in something that sounds authentic, and <em>is</em> authentic. It's running on an NES, in a game, and meeting all the other constraints that entails. Every piece of a game is sharing the resource budget of the whole, and you can't really get a feel for this without working within a complete project.<br /><br /><br />So... I mean, I am interested in all 3 of these things, but there is different motivation for each type of thing.<br /><br />1 is something like Shovel Knight or Volgarr. Maybe you like 3-colour sprite palettes, and square waves, and other artifacts of the NES limitations, but you just use them as stylistic elements and make something fun using those.<br /><br />2 is Demoscene, Famicompo, tech demos, etc. People who really care about what the hardware could do, and usually want to make the most out of a relatively focused scope.<br /><br />3 is retro game development. You care very much that it works and fits on the console. The scope is usually too large to apply a Demoscene level of technique to every element; you have a lot of content to make for a user experience of many hours. It's a different kind of art entirely from number 2, though it shares the need to know the hardware and prove it works.<br /><br /><br />So, like... some of the answers you've got in this thread fall into the mode 2 category, as I see it. Things that are technically possible, but very advanced and not actually seen in games. If I wasn't going to build the demo, though, I'm automatically in category 1, and in category 1 it doesn't really matter if something was marginally possible on the NES or not-- I would just do it if it looked/felt good. If I was in category 3, I would have to make a serious decision about whether the technical effect was worth implementing, whether it would be better to spend your limited development time or ROM budget or other resource on something else. It's a very different mindset.<br /><br />I don't know what you're looking to do, or how you'd categorize these acts, but that's how it's organized in my own headspace, and why I'm interested in each of them differently.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5165">rainwarrior</a> — Mon Feb 02, 2015 11:22 pm</p><hr />

Thanks, tokumaru, that's the thread I was recalling.  I just didn't bother using the search feature because my last search for &quot;hblank palette update&quot; returned nothing, but DuckDuckGo had it on the first result.  Maybe I should have put &quot;+&quot; in front of each part. But I'm very appreciative of what we have.<br />I've been feeling guilty the last few days when I use an Internet search like Google: I saw on TV that just two Google searches uses enough power to boil a cup of tea.<br /><br />That thread, I'm reareading it now.  Two other things about it: 1) it reminded me that I can use any tile number for sprite zero, not just tile 0.  2) Is there any clarification about sprite0's solid pixel length: should it be 8px wide (mines 6) in order to be sure the hit will land. It doesn't seem logical that way. But it was asked in that thread. I shall finish reading.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5875">tsu</a> — Mon Feb 02, 2015 5:42 pm</p><hr />

I don't even know if I ever saw this page before, but if I did, I completely forgot about it.<br /><br />Some items could be worded better, and others explained a little bit further (missing suggested workarounds?), but this is pretty much what I had in mind, and it will do the job just fine.<br /><br />Personally, I find the name &quot;errata&quot; a little misleading, because the people who publish them are usually the same people who made the mistakes in the first place, and we're obviously not Nintendo.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Feb 02, 2015 4:42 pm</p><hr />
