<br />Oh no I didn't mean to go that far. Demos are very impressive. It is always neat seeing what a platform can do in other tasks. I've seen alot of demos you've done and always been quite impressed.
<br />
<br />The thing I mainly didn't like about the guys idea with this fractal engine was this "directdraw" business on PC-Engine really. What's the point if you are just plotting pixels? That's no fun, hardware sprites and BGs are where it's at. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> For games I mean.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Apologies for the long post, but you guys are giving me a lot to work with here <img src="./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />
<br />
<br />IMO, consoles are designed to play games, which is what makes it more impressive when people write console apps for other things.  Resource wastefulness is agreeably a big issue with old CPUs, but it's still an issue today (Did you know an X86 floating-point division can take up to 20 times as long as an addition?  How many polygons the PS2 can render without chugging?  What a 'page fault' even means?).  
<br />
<br />The bigger and more interesting challenge for me is making the hardware do things it was never intended to do precisely <em>because</em> it was designed for games, even if those things are cheap enough to be done during games.  For instance, as has been stated (and with apologies to those of you who know this cold), the NES and PCE use tile-based graphics systems, and have no official 'direct-draw' capacity. Fractals, by definition, are much friendlier to draw when you have individual control over the color of every pixel.  For his Mandelbrot Set demo, ccovel knows some PCE tricks which, whether because I haven't tackled the architecture/terminology the same way he has, or because I'm just being stupid, I'm still wrapping my head around.  They are allowing him to indirectly set the color of every pixel in VRAM in spite of seemingly only having direct control over which 8x8(?) tile from memory is copied to which 8x8 square of VRAM.  The best I could manage for my Mandelbrot Set on on NES was to use 4x4-pixel blocks (as large as 1/4 CHR tile) as 'pixels', since conveniently 4 blocks per tile ^ 4 colors per block = 256, the total number of tile indeces in 1 CHR ROM bank.  I 'direct draw' by calculating the color I want for each block, then looking up the tile with those 4 blocks from my bank.  I suppose I could use individual writes through the PPU to edit actual tile memory, but to me that goes against the notion of how the "average" cartridge was set up- your CHR banks are in ROM, and unless you sacrifice a chunk of a bank to use as a writeable scratchpad (at added cost and headache for the hardware engineers), all you can do is copy existing tiles into your nametables.  My earlier comment on how the NES architecture makes getting at your CHR data difficult revolved around precisely this- the CHR address space is not directly accessible by the CPU, only by reads/writes through the PPU, and even then writes to your actual pixel bitmaps are expected to fizzle under most circumstances.
<br />
<br />Similarly, I acknowledge games like Battletoads, Kirby's Adventure, Final Fantasy III, Somari, and others are awesome games, but knowing what the NES "can" do, I can pick out pretty much exactly how the games are working their magic.  Games like Recca are far more entertaining for me because I can't always tell how the system does what it's doing.  Recca has got to be devoting some seriously anal timing loops to those full-screen raster waving effects, but moreover, I could swear I count more than 64 sprites going at once without much clipping or flicker, even on 'strict' emus like Nestopia.  Heck, the train level in Little Nemo had me mildly stumped for a bit with its apparent multi-layered multi-directional scrolling/parallax.  Even the MegaMan 2 title uses a vertical parallax effect that "shouldn't be possible."  And porting SMB to the PCE?  I can see how a good bit of the game code would be a straight shot, but the whole reason I've been curious about the graphics, sound and I/O is to see how much one would need to bend over backwards or come up with creative solutions to make the PCE do something it may not have been intended to.

I'd imagine that RPGs for the Super Famicom do the same so that they can put kanji into text boxes. So does that proportional font demo that Blargg and I made for <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1179" class="postlink">that ebook project</a>. In fact, the menu for the GBA and DS versions of <a href="http://www.pineight.com/lj/" class="postlink">Lockjaw</a> works like this, treating the screen as a pixel-mapped surface despite that it's actually made of tiles, so that it can use a proportional font and still fit in the "little bank" of the DS VRAM.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I suppose I could use individual writes through the PPU to edit actual tile memory, but to me that goes against the notion of how the "average" cartridge was set up- your CHR banks are in ROM</div>
<br />So U*ROM, A*ROM, B*ROM, and SNROM aren't "average"? I'll grant that CPROM and TQROM are special cases.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fine, fine, you win.  I've only built a NES on a protoboard and hooked carts up to it, never actually built a cart.  My impression from the console's end was that the majority of carts used non-writeable memory for CHR, and from a ROM programmer standpoint, that even writeable CHR memory was of limited value since the PPU could only index 256 tiles per layer- enough for some font characters or basic line drawing, but a bit lacking for large-scale rendering.
<br />I can believe that the newer the system, the larger and more prevalent writeable memories become, I'm just surprised so many developers would have gone to the effort/expense in the late 80s.
<br />
<br />And that still doesn't contradict the notion that drawing a full-screen fractal by manually rewriting the tiles is a trick on PCE and not really an option on NES.
<br />...unless you, say, manually track which tiles would be identical and hope that in any given render you don't need more than 256 unique tiles... (edit: or, reading up on that e-book thread, 512 tiles provided only 256 were needed for any given set of rows)
<br />Y'know, that may just work, what with all the detail being on relatively thin edges around the nodes.  I may need to try it some time.  Would I be correct to guess that since writeability is determined by the type of chip in the cart, not the console, most emulators will honor writes to CHR as if the cart did use writeable memory?

<br />Emulators decide whether to honor CHR writes by looking at the board spec, which makes up the first 16 bytes of an iNES file. The key values for this are the board class (aka "mapper number") and the CHR ROM size. Two board classes (TQROM and some Chinese MMC3-clones) have both CHR RAM and ROM, selected by the CHR bank number. Emulators assign 8 KiB of (writable) CHR RAM after the end of CHR ROM. For everything else, if the CHR ROM size is 0 KiB, emulators assign the appropriate amount of CHR RAM based on the board class: 16 KiB for CPROM and 8 KiB for most everything else.

<br />I suppose combining multiple memory chips <em>would</em> be nicer with a mapper.  <em>Possible</em> without (EE rant omitted), but ugly.  Are there really carts out there that use CHR writes as NOPs so emulators <em>need</em> to check the mapper, or does every cart with CHR RAM simply happen to have a mapper that has other functionality that the emulator needs to handle and/or fall into the 1 bank ROM / 1 bank RAM class?
<br />
<br />Edit: Bleh.  Yeah.  Okay.  More than 2 banks === uses a mapper. *headsmack*  But for mapperless carts, it does sound like the emulator gets to assume that any bank not filled with stuff is writeable.
<br />
<br />One of the things I was most relieved about during the make-a-NES project was that all the mapper stuff was cart-side so we didn't actually need to worry much about it.  Sadly, while my 6502 seemed to step through code just fine on the carts we plugged in, and the PPU team got everything right graphically, we came together at the last minute and realized that their PPU didn't hold the vblank line for 3 PPU cycles and my 6502 couldn't latch a signal held for only 1/3 of a cycle, so inevitably any commercial game we tried locked up in a NMI wait before anything was drawn <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> At any rate, I got small graphical corruption when I tried writing freely to the VDC in my Fractal Engine program, so I set up writes to occur during HBlank interrupts</div>
<br />
<br /> Hey Chris. If I'm correct, you're not using a double buffer for the image (not enough room for two 512x240 images). If the CPU is writing to the same location that the VDC is reading from, then you'll get an artifact for that row of 8 pixels. I usually trail the VDC raster by one scanline if I'm not using a double buffer system. 
<br />
<br /> That chart Charles put up is for the speed of the VRAM. Slow modes, which <em>aren't</em> used for the PCE, give less CPU slots. The slowest mode gives no CPU slots during active display. These unused modes were for the VDC paired with slow and really slow VRAM. It also limits the VDC to 2bit tiles/sprites instead of 4bit because of slower ram. The slowest mode also limits the sprite scanline limit to half. I guess that's kind of irrelevant. 
<br />
<br /> But the DOT clock chart for normal (fastest vram setting) mode shows the number of CPU slots open to word writes in a 8 pixel segment of a scanline during active display. If the CPU writes to the VDC data port and the VDC is busy with another access slot, the VDC will assert /RDY until that slot is free. For 5.37mhz mode, each slot in the DOT chart is equivalent 1.33 CPU cycles long. So if you write to the latch $0003 ($0002 LSB has no delay), you'll get a small fraction of a CPU cycle delay on any misaligned writes. Faster pixel clock modes have faster slot times and even smaller fractional delays.
<br />
<br /> So you still have unlimited read and write access to vram during active display. 
<br />
<br /> Setting up the VDC for larger incremental writes with tiles arranged in a certain pattern will allow you to write an entire scanline of pixels into vram without changing vram position, but for 16 colors you have to do a two pass. Still muuuch faster than writing 8 pixels, then reposition the vram pointer, doing the math, etc. If you use low res mode (256) and setup sprites to fill the entire screen  - using it as a background, you can do some amiga style effects since that would give you 4 independent bit planes (one WORD would write 16 pixels at a time).
<br />
<br /> 
<br /> On the original topic of the SMB port, I did a compare of the extracted rom and a headerless NES SMB rom. Looks like a large chunk was change. Probably the tilemap format as the original code looks to be intact - sans a few hacks. The sprites are unchanged though and are padded to 16x16 even though they are still 8x8. A lot of the PPU writes are changed to JSRs. The PCE has ZP in a different address location, so the hack maps the same 8k RAM into both $0000-1fff and $2000-3fff.
