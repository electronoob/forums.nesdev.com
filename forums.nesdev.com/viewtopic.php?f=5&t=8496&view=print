<br />
<br />I'd like to organize this again for 2012 and want to get some input on a few things:
<br />
<br />1.  Deadline
<br />2.  Voting
<br />3.  Prizes
<br />
<br />On a side note, the nintendoage people are getting <a href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&amp;threadid=51557&amp;StartRow=51#bottom" class="postlink">antsy</a> for the multi-cart, any updates for us Memblers?

<br />
<br />What about revisions then?  I know that there were a few revisions last time, and essentially people could read feedback, then make revisions.  I agree completely with the youtube videos and comments.

On the deadline the entries are finalized for judging, so revisions aren't interfere with the judging process.

Honestly, December is usually really busy.  If you are a college student, you will have exams, then Christmas, then getting ready to start classes again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1.  I think having it end at the end of the year is a bad idea.  That is when many people will have the least amount of time.  If it ended at the end of summer (late Aug, early Sept?) then there would be more last minute time available.  That might also give enough time for carts to be sold before xmas.  8 months from now is a long time for something that isn't expected to be a complete large scale game.
<br />
<br />2.  Voting seemed slow but fine, except I didn't win!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  If you want to add more you could do a website poll that counts as much as 1 judge.  
<br />
<br />3.  If prizes are actually important it shouldn't be hard to find more donors.  Probably not something to worry about because I doubt there are people who won't enter because the prizes are small.

(IMO it's unfair, a small sample size sucks.)

<br />
<br />I think the 2 categories worked pretty well last year, if it is OK with everyone else I don't see why we would change it.
<br />
<br />@koitsu, I'll be in touch  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />   Hopefully we'll have some extra prize money from the multicart sales as well.
<br />
<br />Voting was slow and I take responsibility for that.  Open voting will be implemented this year.
<br />
<br />So everyone who is interested, there WILL be a competition again this year, details will be forthcoming.  Best of luck to everyone this year!

<br />One of my friends build a 3d plastics printer.  I asked him if he thought that he could fabricate NES cart cases, possibly with custom game artwork embossed on the surface of the cart, in lieu of a label.  He thought that it would be in interesting project and may take it up. This would be totally bitchin'... but probably not ready any time soon.
<br />
<br />His home-made 3d printer:
