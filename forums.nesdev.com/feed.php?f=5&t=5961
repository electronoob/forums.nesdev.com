Many time MS had to add some "compatibility patch" to help that poorly written software to work again on XP (Lotus note is one example and so his many, many games...). A normal user will try his software and if it not work, will blame the OS right away but it's not always the case: poor software is written by everyone, not just MS like everyone seems to think <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Don't forget that early adopters will always have issues at the beginning, it's still a new os.  Same thing with XP and previous version of MS OS too.  So is hardware like the snes powerpak but that's normal and the compatibility will get better with time.  There is so many combination of hardware that you cannot find all bugs in one shot. A OS is quite a complicated beast and I'm surprised that it can still run without too much issues on so many combination of hardware.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu Jan 21, 2010 3:26 pm</p><hr />

windows 7 has replaced Vista and xp, I have not tried 7 and I hate vista, The only reason windows 98, me and 2000 are not better than XP is because they have worse security and dose not support new devices, if they where up to date with full support they would be a better operating systems in my opinion . XP will continue to be the better choice till support for it runs out.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=188">peppers</a> — Thu Jan 21, 2010 8:35 am</p><hr />

After a ton of updates, it's better, but still not as good as XP. Windows XP was a huge step forward from Windows ME and 2000, and I said so at the time.

No disrespect to the previous poster on the subject but it's funny how people say that Win 7 is so slow compared to XP for games etc. People were saying the same thing when XP came out and said how Win98 was better too!<br /><br />The point is, with time, Win7 will be better for games. For now it just came out so don't expect too much. And don't forget that XP is already on life support and the support to companies will stop in 2014.  <br /><br />I'm not saying that I hate XP, on the opposite I like it and more than happy with it but I have been using Win7 RC for a while and you know, it's not that bad compared to vista.  I didn't like the new taskbar but once you get used to it, it's not that bad too.<br /><br />As for Linux.... Every time I install it and start to tweak a few setting in KDE or something like that: it dies on me.  I gave up trying to make it work.  I tried I don't remember which distro and I always end up with some kind of weird issue that I have to debug. I don't have time anymore for those things.  As a server OS, I don't have anything against it. It does the job.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />And just to do a low blow on purpose, every year in the linux world is " the year of the desktop".  I think I don't believe in Santa claus and Duke Nukem forever anymore  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu Jan 21, 2010 4:07 am</p><hr />

Well I must say I find Ubuntu 9.04 ok as long as you only want to do very standard things (I haven't tried other Linuxes so I can't tell), and if you have all your hardware supported. On my old PC it was terrible, it had no sound and eventually it crashed when booting, but on my new PC it seems fine.<br /><br />Another beef is that it seems all emus I've tried for Linux (FCEUltra, ZSNES, VBA, and another PS1 emulator I can't remember the name) runs WAY slower than on Windows, and don't have any graphical filters.<br /><br />But as soon as you want to do something like format an USB key, find an hex editor, play a NSF or PSF2 file, or install a program who isn't in the list of programms that can easily be automatically installed, welcome to HELL - without having a PHD in computer science you basically don't have a chance. (if you're lucky running a windows program in Wine will work). Another annoyance is how the drives are "located" in the "dev" directory and have those stupid SDA names.<br /><br />I'd say I have absolutely no knowledge about security, but everyone says Linux is more secure than windows so that should be true - probably it's because much less people regularly use Linux so hackers don't bother programming stuff for this case, but as soon as many people will use it regularly it won't be true. So yeah I use Linux whenever I want to do something dirty, which is not often.<br /><br />Anyway, any Windows and Linux OS will be WAY better than any apple CRAP out there and that's all that counts.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Jan 20, 2010 2:28 pm</p><hr />

Still, Dell PCs with Ubuntu sold in the United States come with licensed DVD playback software.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">peppers wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />for running windows apps if your computer has decent power and you can't get it to run using wine, Vmware Server, or Virtualbox should work assuming you can't just find a Linux equivalent of whatever it is.<br /></div><br />Virtual machines are good at running applications, but there are two drawbacks. First, you have to buy a retail copy of the operating system. In the United States, a retail copy of Windows costs about $200, but a Wii-size Acer Aspire Revo PC including a keyboard, a mouse, and a bundled OEM copy of Windows also costs $200. So you might as well buy a KVM switch instead of Parallels Desktop or VMware or whatever. Second, virtual machines often don't perfectly forward an emulated device driver's direct hardware access to the actual hardware, so good luck using USB peripherals such as a label printer or a receipt printer or a webcam.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">phazmatis wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />what in particular is the devices?<br /></div><br />Microtek ScanMaker 4850 USB flatbed scanner, listed on sane-project.org as unsupported for years. On another PC back in the Mandrake 9.1 days, it was the Radeon 9000 video card. I bet that's supported by now, but now that's my only Windows machine and I don't feel like taking two minutes to switch between applications. But I bought my current laptop (ASUS Eee PC 900) specifically because it was the cheapest one I could find locally that would run Linux well.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Wed Jan 20, 2010 12:23 pm</p><hr />

This is a common misconception from people who have not tried out Linux themselves. once more my recommendation is mint.<br />Linux can run "Live" from the cd without the need to install it try it out yourself b4 you comment on it again.</div><br /><br />Actually, I'm running Ubuntu 9.04 right now. I'd also be running linux on my desktop, but linux has this nice habit of installing just fine and then giving me a blank screen once I try to boot it from the actual hard drive. I've tried Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Slackware, with identical results. Probably my motherboard or graphics card are not supported, but I'm not going to replace hardware to get linux working. Oh, I tried the common linux boot options, and none of them fix the problem. I'll just stick with XP, which installs all of my drivers without any trouble.<br />I'm using 64-bit linux, and there are problems associated with that. For example, all of the flash player plugins are either 32-bit exclusive or require all sorts of contortions to install them. Someone makes an install script, but the next version of ubuntu breaks them. Ubuntu 9.04 finally got the video working in this laptop, it was a nightmare of restricted drivers that didn't install correctly before.<br /><br />Windows 7 is still pretty bad. Web browsers freeze up for 30 seconds at a time any time I open too many (4 or more) youtube pages (on a dual-core 3.2ghz desktop this should not be happening). Games run at one half the framerate as in XP. And even when I lower the graphics settings in games, and bring the framerate up to 60+, the games jerk and lag like they did in Vista. XP runs them fine.<br /><br />I use linux for online banking because windows security is a joke. XP, Vista, 7,.. I don't trust any of them. The only secure windows PC is behind an actual firewall (not a crappy residential router that will happily pass any forged packet marked "192.168.1.4" along to your desktop), running a non-Norton (and non-McAfee) antivirus with COMODO firewall (or some other competent firewall) set on "paranoid mode". And then don't ever use flash, acrobat, javascript, etc.............<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4150">phazmatis</a> — Wed Jan 20, 2010 11:48 am</p><hr />
