<br />
<br />I agree. It's not like the game wil behave differently because of this "garbage" I mean the games were designed to work with garbage around them.

<br />Garbage data has nothing to do with the topic. We're talking about missing data, GAP and CRC. Get your facts straight.

I pefer to release proper documentation of the dumps in pdf format, this is what I'm doing currently.
<br />
<br />I'd be interested to know how tepples got his 1:1 copies.
<br />If there is a hardware that does such copies, can you link me to it?
<br />Tototek copier (currently a prototype) aims at doing  1:1 copies. I hope they succeed someday.

<br />What 1:1 copies? The only perfect copies of FDS games I know about are the ones that used to be inside Nintendo's "writing system" kiosks. This would be the Holy Grail of FDS emulation, but to the best of my knowledge, no writing system ROM ever leaked to the public.

<br />supposing he meant 1:1 copies by "full dumps"

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, X-or, you're being silly.
<br />JUST because EVERY SINGLE DUMPED non-kiosked FDS disk has CORRECT crc16s and has NO data at the end, does NOT, by ANY MEANS, mean that *EVERY* non-kiosked FDS disk does. Its like trying to prove global warming.
<br />The disk HAS the crc16 data on it, and it CAN be read off of the disk. So the point is IF WE CAN READ OFF THE DATA, WHY DON'T WE?
<br />
<br />Also, we should read off the pre-gap timing data too. Yes, it's just lots of zeroes, but its a SPECFIC NUMBER of zeroes.
<br />
<br />Not backing up data 'just because everything else has the data correct and so we assume the data is always correct here' is an incredibly stupid idea. Its on the order of "hey, just because all non-prototype snes roms have the checksum correct, we'll just remove the checksum from the rom image because we know its correct and can regenerate it, and we save four whole bytes!"
