I didn't think of that, but that would allow him to fix his current non-working cartridge by desoldering the upper address lines (provided he knows which ones are above the actual data and just related to padded data) and fixing their position. But this is another good reason to just properly mirror data to fill the chip up. Then it's one less issue to worry about. Mirroring opposed to padding is very simple.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Tue Apr 13, 2010 11:17 am</p><hr />

It doesn't make any difference. The board was made so that both 128k chips 28-pin and 256k chips 32-pin would fit in and work. I don't think there was any games using SKROM with 256k PRG in america released, but in theory that was perfectly possible.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Apr 10, 2010 2:50 pm</p><hr />

That's what I thought... But interestingly enough, the SKROM doesn't ship with a 32 pin chip in the PRG spot like you'd expect, but a 28 pin one. Though it has holes for a 32 pin chip. Does the fact that they used a different chip in there make a difference at all?<br /><br /><img src="http://www.thenesdump.com/board%20pics/NES_SKROM.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And BTW, I have not yet seen an SKROM which has a 32 pin mask ROM chip in there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=450">arfink</a> — Sat Apr 10, 2010 2:45 pm</p><hr />

I freely released my part of the source code (the NES-side of things), the XMODEM part was written by another 6502 guy, Daryl Rictor, and is free to use with credit given.

There's 32kB instead of 8kB of SRAM (not battery backed though - you save it to flash).  The next revision will have USB onboard, the "current" version was made in 2004 and I'm just now bringing it back to life to get the basic functionality up and running again, and into the hands of a few developers and testers.  The cart also has some extra sound functions, whenever NTRQ's source is available I definitely want to look into replacing (ideally, adding in), the sound channels with the ones my synth generates.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Fri Apr 09, 2010 1:17 pm</p><hr />
