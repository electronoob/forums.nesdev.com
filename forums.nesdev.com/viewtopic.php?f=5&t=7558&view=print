<br />I was hoping that one of our Japanese speaking members would be willing to roughly translate what is being discussed on this news footage.
<br />
<br />The giant whirlpool looks like it is close to a shoreline, but I don't know where along the shore it is.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Me and my family are fine. I relocated them in the south because of the next issue which is the possible nuclear reactor meltdown which I hope will not happen.
<br />
<br />I didn't access a computer for a while so I didn't follow nesdev at all like I do usually everyday.  I don't think I can focus on games at all these days.
<br />
<br />It was shaking quite a lot on the 11th around 14h.  It was so strong that it lasted for a few minutes. I never saw a building move so much in my life.  It was quite scary.
<br />
<br />Then all the train were stopped.  This mean if you were leaving outside Tokyo, tough luck: you either go back by foot and walk 30km or more or wait at some shelter that something goes better.
<br />
<br />Aftershock were so common that we didn't know if another big earthquake was going to happen or not. Then the tsunami news, everybody in the north affected. They have no food, no water, no power, no gaz and now the weather is going bad. They are in hell right now. The death toll is rising everyday.
<br />
<br />And now if it wasn't enough, the nuclear reactor is going quite bad in Fukushima. This increase the stress of everybody.  They don't know what they are doing and nothing seems to really go forward.
<br />
<br />Controlled blackout are done around Tokyo to reduce the power usage to avoid a complete blackout.  
<br />
<br />Let's just say these days I'm not in the mood to work in Tokyo. I would prefer to be elsewhere with my family. I will go back to the south tonight to take another rest but this is quite costly to do so. And I have to go back after the long weekend to work..
<br />
<br />I will try to give more news once I can. For now I know a lot about what is going but I have no time to translate or say more. Too busy.

I couldn't even imagine how badly the people in the north of Japan are hurting if you're still affected and you're okay.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> Hope everything turns out okay!
