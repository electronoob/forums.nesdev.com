I know that people worked directly with assembly for the NES, and probably for the SNES too, but what about the N64? Were things fast enough yet that they could use C (and maybe C++?). What about the GBA? (I assume that for the GB and GBC, people used assembly directly.)

Shiru's games don't have any lag. Also in KNES I have included a basic platformer demo which is entirely written in C (Shiru's games use an assembly library), so if you have trouble with showing text on screen, I don't know what to say.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, mostly assembly for a long time for games on all systems. C came in to use a lot earlier for home computer games, but a few developers were still writing in mostly assembly well into the 90s.<br /><br />There are a few rare examples on the NES that it has been suggested were using some C (e.g. Koei's Romancing Saga II).<br /><br />I think most PC game developers were moving into C maybe around 1990. For consoles, more like 1994. Many were using C for PSX.<br /><br />Nowadays C++ is pretty dominant, I think it took hold in the late 90s, not sure when.<br /><br />(This is all based on personal anecdotal experience with old game source, and developers I've talked to. I don't know anything about N64 or GBA stuff, so I won't comment there.)

The XNA platform requires C#, as I understand, but outside of XNA C# is not typically used for 360 development. C++ is the standard language for 360.<br /><br />The vast majority of games commercially released for 360 are written in C++. Perhaps you could limit your definition of &quot;small developer&quot; to someone who is using XNA. Probably anyone who can't get access to a 360 devkit is going to use XNA, but we should be clear about how &quot;small&quot; the small developer has to be.

I was (and am) asking about whether real games were written in asm or not, and if they were, would the speed loss gained by using compiled code be as big as feared and that the game would be reduced in quality?. Of course, I realize that this answer will vary from game to game.<br /><br />Thanks for the all the responses so far.

The trouble is that standard C and standard C++ cannot be compiled to CLR bytecode; it must be compiled to native code. This rules out using standard C or standard C++ in the Xbox Live Indie Games or Windows Phone 7 environment, neither of which allows the use of native code.<br /><br /><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3y322t50.aspx" class="postlink">Emit</a> is the way to create CLR bytecode at runtime. Languages that use the Dynamic Language Runtime, such as IronPython, use Emit for something, and I'm not sure what. The trouble is that the .NET Compact Framework, used by the Xbox Live Indie Games and Windows Phone 7 environments, does not implement Emit.

The real qualification is not really having an office or something like that (even though that has been used historically as one of Nintendo's arbitrary reasons); the bottom line is whether they think you have a viable business strategy.<br /><br />Anyhow I just wanted to be clear that most XBLA games by developers that you might consider &quot;small&quot;, like Super Meat Boy, or Braid, are written in C++ and do not use the XNA platform. However, the XBox Live Indie Games service is entirely XNA/C#, so far as I know.
