But if end up using a JMP to where the NMI starts, my NMI code will run, but the NMI pointer is not logging, it's the IRQ pointer that is logging.<br /><br />So am I only supposed to have a certain amount of code within the reset vector?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You do not &quot;exit&quot; your reset vector.  RTI or RTSing out of it is wrong.  The reset vector is where your program starts.  The code that gets executed from there must keep running for as long as you want your program to run (ie:  until the user quits... so it should run forever).<br /><br /><br />Typically the reset vector initializes things.. then enters a loop.  The loop will get interrupted by NMIs every frame, so you can drive your logic.<br /><br />You also should not JMP to your NMI code... since the NMI code should typically only be called when there's an NMI.  So instead... enable NMIs, then spin in a loop waiting for an NMI to happen.

I figured sei would take care of that, being set interrupts. :-/<br /><br />I took a look at super Mario bros, and I see that it loops itself on a jmp. I tried doing that with my work, but the NMI still does not kick in. I noticed The Legend of Zelda does the same thing, it will loop itself on a jmp...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SEI actually disables interrupts. It sets the flag that masks IRQs, preventing them from taking effect.<br /><br />However, SEI and CLI are not related to the NMI. The NMI is the &quot;non-maskable interrupt&quot;, meaning it's separate from the regular IRQ line and not affected by that flag.<br /><br />The high bit written to $2000 will enable the NMI, if set. What happens when this is enabled is that whenever vblank begins, execution of your code (wherever you've reached starting from your reset vector) will be interrupted in the middle of what it's doing and jump to the routine specified in your NMI vector. When finished with your NMI routine, use RTI (return from interrupt) to return to the previously running code.<br /><br />So... to enable the NMI, write $80 to $2000. Don't do this until you're finished setting everything up in your reset code.<br /><br />Other IRQs will use the IRQ vector instead, and are effected by SEI and CLI, but I expect you don't have a use for them yet, so you should leave SEI enabled. The reason standard startup code has an SEI is to prevent any interrupts from trying to execute code before your program has had time to set itself up.<br /><br /><br />Also, I saw the line <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">BEQ $2002</tt> in your posted source. That's not really what you have there, is it? BEQ should be followed by a label. It can't jump to an absolute address like that, and even if it could, it certainly shouldn't jump to $2002, where there is no code to be run. Also, you might consider this common alternative for the vblank wait:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">:<br />bit $2002<br />bpl :-</div><br />BIT is a strange instruction, but one of the things it can do is test the high bit of the address specified (goes into the sign flag). This saves you the trouble of an extra AND instruction. Probably not too important here, but in situations where timing is more critical this will get you a more accurate timing.

I use the FCEUX debugger, and I have no issues.<br /><br />Also, that NMI enable seems to have fixed my control push bit issue. The register that shows a button held down was fine, but the register that shows you pressed a button, never reset itself, sometimes would throw random values into it. But that's all been fixed now, so my P1/P2 controls are working properly. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
