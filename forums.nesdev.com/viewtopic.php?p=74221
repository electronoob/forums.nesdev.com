<br />It's 16 bytes actually. There are a lot of things wrong with iNES, it can't properly describe a number of existing games because it doesn't allow for things like more than 8KB of CHR-RAM, more than 8KB of SRAM, mix of CHR-RAM and CHR-ROM, less than 16KB of PRG-ROM, things like that. Some of those problems were solved by assigning mapper numbers to these "weird" games, but that's just a hack really. iNES 2.0 solved all of these problems I think, by introducing fields that control those previously overlooked characteristics, but it still only describes existing hardware, which means that creating new mappers is difficult.
<br />
<br />For old commercial software preservation I believe iNES 2.0 is OK though, but the problem is that there are already too may ROMs with bad header floating around, and you can't force everyone to update their ROMs, so some people think the solution is to change the emulators. I hardly thing this is a solution, because an incredible number of people (the average pirate Joe) is still using outdated emulators.
<br />
<br />For preservation purposes, I say the solution is to manually fix all ROMs with iNES 2.0 headers and make that the "official" preservation package. If people want to download it, fine, if not, screw them. Those who are interested will know that those are the cleanest ROMs possible.</div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">byuu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You can try something like what bSNES is doing (refusing to support all sorts of ROM formats, particularly .SMC which is used by the majority and instead insisting everyone use .BIN)</div><br /><br />.bin? I require .sfc, which stands for Super Famicom. I disallow the Super Magicom extension because I am not emulating a copier.</div><br /><br />As I understand it, BIN and SFC are the same thing -- they are raw ROM dumps with no headers or footers/tails (aside from the official Nintendo-sanctioned ROM information that's retained at the end of the first bank; I forget the 24-bit address for it, something like $00FE00-FEFF, or $C0FE00-FEFF).<br /><br />In turn, this makes me wonder why you don't support (non-split) .SMC files, choosing to ignore the first 512 bytes of the file thus effectively ending up with a BIN/SFC.  I mean, is a single lseek() call really that hard?  As for the other formats (MGH, etc.), sure, I can understand dropping support for those given that they're truly legacy, but most people honour SMC for the same reason they honour the NES format -- it came first.  These are what you'll find across the entire Internet, and even on CD (yes, I had a few organisations send me ROM CDs back in the day, they're all SMC or split-file SMC).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">byuu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">koitsu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">but all that will do is alienate you (or in the case of bSNES, the emulator) from the rest of the world.</div><br />What's funny is that it really didn't. I removed fullscreen, ZIP/7-zip multi-archive suppot, rewind, movie recording and playback, integrated software filters (as opposed to plugins), multi-key assignments (shift+N = player 2 B), GUI shortcut key assignments, IPS support, auto and manual turbo fire support, pseudo-widescreen zoom (near aspect-correct scale), video cropping, custom path support for every type of file, OS-native file load dialog, region override, copier header support, 22 different ROM header extensions, drag-and-drop, etc.<br /><br />Did all that months ago. And you know what? Latest release has 10,000 downloads. That's fairly standard. I include a small, 50KB GUI utility. You point it at your ROM folder, hit scan. It tells you what it will do to your ROMs, hit OK. You are done.</div>
<br />
<br />The number of downloads doesn't mean crap.  Validation: the last time I downloaded and ran bSNES 0.74 (or newer) and pointed it to a directory of ROMs that contained .SMC files, it returned absolutely no results (no files shown).  I immediately clicked [X] and deleted the bsnes\ folder, going back to 0.73.  So, I downloaded it, but I found the file format tirade you're on to be not worth the effort to deal with.  I am not alone in this matter; most of my peers who I've pointed your User Guide to responded with "What the FUCK?" when they read the tirade.  So the word "alienate" is accurate here.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, like the rest of the world, I am not going to run a ROM conversion utility because a single emulator author is on such a tirade.  What makes you think I want to run all of my games in just bsnes and not a multitude of emulators (yes, I do this!  I tend to use SNES9x, ZSNES, and bsnes)?  Furthermore, I have a SWC DX32 and a working SNES; maybe I want to send some games to my copier via the parallel port transfer utility... oh now look what I have to do, convert all the games from SFC to SMC using UCON or doing it by hand.  Then I get to do this again when........ you get the idea.  I should point out that the directory is filled with ~400 files.
<br />
<br />I say all this with as much sincerity as possible.  I don't want to argue or fight, honestly, but this tirade against file formats is silly.  The motives are positive, but it's too late and all you're doing is what I described: alienating people (users of your emulator).</div>

A lot of these formats did use interleaving initially, and as far as I know, only Super Sleuth supports the SWC interleave format, ZSNES supports a very small number of 5-6MB image interleave formats, and that's it.<br /><br />Nowadays the extensions are meaningless. Too many extensions wreck a file load window, lots of false positive matches, pain in the ass to use OS file assign when you have to do it for 22+ extensions, etc.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">These are what you'll find across the entire Internet, and even on CD</div><br /><br />So?

Great. It'll be completely dead in 5-10 more when the EEPROM BIOS on that POS bitrots. Then you can upgrade to the 21st century where we use flash cartridges with SD/CF support. Near-instant loading and every game ever on one tiny SD card, and they sell for 1/3rd the price of copiers, and you don't have to send an e-mail to a guy on Usenet to track down a lead on a guy he heard may have a copier for sale four years ago to get one. Good for you.<br /><br />Now let's look at your ROM set. There are over a dozen known copier header formats, and different copiers only support certain ones. No copier supports them all. Most ROMs don't even have headers and all, and Nach subverted them to store NSRT data for some inane reason. The odds that your internet or mail-order CD is going to have SWC-compatible headers is next to none.<br /><br />So what do you do? You convert your ROMs to have SWC headers! You want to use X, convert to X's format. Wow, that sounds familiar. Why aren't you tracking down the SWC makers and complaining? Hell you actually PAID for your copier. All you've given me was info on Felon's Banana Register.<br /><br />Or an even smarter idea, that uCON at least should do: uCON send gamename.sfc should add the SWC header in memory and send it, that way it works regardless of header. What about all those user (not plural) with copiers that only support loading interleaved formats? Shouldn't they be complaining that ZSNES and Snes9X won't load those images without conversion, too?<br /><br />No, I'm not going to miss you, Nightcrawler, and the nine other people with copiers.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The motives are positive, but it's too late and all you're doing is what I described: alienating people (users of your emulator).</div>
<br />
<br />I used to really care about such things. And then I realized I was making myself miserable, bending over backwards, to support the very users that annoyed me the most.
<br />
<br />The same ones complaining that ZSNES was just as accurate and ran faster, the same ones happy to use closed-source emulators, the same ones too lazy to click two buttons to make my life easier, etc.
<br />
<br />I don't care. I really, really don't care. Don't use bsnes. I'm not getting royalty checks for it. I just made myself miserable, and pissed off all the other emulator devs engaging these types of people. Kind of like I'm doing now! Oh, the irony of it all.
<br />
<br />I have no need to have the most popular emulator for a given 20+ year old game system. I am not out to impress your colleagues. For what? So the two times in my adult professional life I've ran into someone who could name an SNES emulator in person, I could say, "oh hey I wrote that!" Why bother?
<br />
<br />Anyway, if the ZSNES and Snes9X team also had a spine, this would already be a non-issue. Unlike the NES scene that is forever cursed with iNES 1.0+DISKDUDE, we had a real chance to fix all of these problems. We would not be having this conversation if they were reasonable.
<br />
<br />To be brutally honest, the NES scene could fix the iNES 1.0 situation as well. Yes, even today. But you're more concerned with duking it out for popularity. Yeah, Joe Sixpack can stick with the ROM set and emulator he downloaded in 1998. Who cares, he isn't upgrading to your new emulator anyway. Just as a bsnes v073 user is the same to me as a ZSNES user. In a way, you all get what you deserve. One has no philosophical right to complain about something he actively encourages and passively supports.</div>

<br />byuu, your emulator is supposed to be about accuracy and preservation. There is absolutely no point in arguing with old codgers who expect the ass-backward, wrong way of doing things they learned 16 years ago to still work today.
<br />
<br />Maybe with some luck the new people trickling into the emulation scene will be more willing to make the change since they aren't carrying around the mental baggage of Super Pasofami and Esnes and they â€“ most likely â€“ won't be trying to run bsnes on handed-down hardware from 1997.
<br />
<br />We're talking about users who see nothing wrong with running ClrMame and rebuilding their entire 26GB ROM set to comply with all the inane CRC changes that occur between MAME versions, but who will then bitch about a one-off conversion of their SNES set that not only ensures compatibility in bsnes, but does not break compatibility in other emulators.

<br />Even new-in-box hardware manufactured in the past two years might not necessarily be capable of running bsnes at full speed. Case in point: Acer's Aspire Revo, ASUS's Eee Box, and other small, quiet PCs with an Atom CPU and an NVIDIA ION chipset. Now ION has a GeForce 9400 GPU, which can run CUDA- and OpenCL-accelerated decoders, making it ideal for watching AVC video on your HDTV. But then someone gets the bright idea to try playing 20-year-old video games on the PC that happens to be already connected to the TV, and its Atom CPU becomes a liability, as <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=60693#60693" class="postlink">kyuusaku discovered</a>.</div>

<br />
<br />I'm not sure I understand why the *emulator* [the tool or the person writing the tool, you pick] has to be the one worrying about the authenticity/preservation of the ROM it's trying to emulate.  That worry is squarely in the *user* domain.  If I as a user want to play SMB but I end up downloading and running SMB "penis hack" and offending my kids...my fault.  What's next, an emulator spitting up a "this ROM is not authentic and may contain offensive content...continue anyway?" message?
<br />
<br />If I as a person care about authenticity/preservation of ROMs, I should feel free to create what I think is a valid database format for storing such information.  I should also be willing to accept rejection of adoption of my declared format by either a)fellow preservationists, or b)emulator authors that believe that authenticity/preservation is not their problem [or at least they don't need/want to enforce it and alienate a community of homebrewers].
<br />
<br />That being said, my application spits out BootGod information for loaded .NES files, just incase the user cares to validate the authenticity before proceeding.
<br />
<br />As an emulator author I don't want more formats to support if there's no benefit to supporting them.  But I would be interested in a database that tells me what all the authentic game details should be...which I believe we already have in BootGod [and I think there was mention of one other somewhere in this loooong thread!]</div>

Which actually would be kinda fun ... if I had all the time in the world :P<br /><br />Anyway, I was saying that I'm <em>personally</em> not concerned with running an NES emulator on a GBA, not that I wasn't interested in the GB itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'll take the rest of this up privately, because actually after reading some of your responses, I'm pretty damn pissed off.</div>
<br />
<br />I apologize if I've upset you. I am certainly blunt and honest, but even with sugarcoating, our underlying points are the same, eg "no offense, but ..." I'm not the slightest bit upset or angry here, I'm just extremely opinionated as a result of a decade and a half of dealing with these issues.
<br />
<br />If you'd rather I not counter your responses, I am willing to comply. It will save me some time anyway.</div>

This question still hasn't been answered! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div><br /><br />It was answered before anyone even responded. I laid it out cold that rom-side mapping is fundamentally flawed in that it can't effectuate inevitable revisions. "Just get every rom supplier to update to iNES 2.0 and we're good!" Even if you could convince them that it was worth it, with what tool based on whose database? And then, if they succeeded, how would anyone know they were getting it since iNES 2.0 shares the same extension as iNES 1.0? There are too many layers of bullshit for users to understand, you've fucked yourself. No one will ever use your emulator and KNOW that they won't have some random assfuck error from headers 50 years from now.<br /><br />And you can sit here and lament the fact that unlicensed material can never, attain that level of certainty because no one will ever volunteer to add 50,000 entries to an emulator-side solution, or you can at least get it for licensed games which SHOULD have a higher priority than your basement boards anyway.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Not like adding 20 bytes doesn't destroy the ROM, it's there. Extract it!</div><br /><br />And I suppose you like to put rocks in your doorways to jump over them.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And with that format you also need two files, which lugging two files on my PC instead of insta-clicking one and is brough up in FCEUX perfectly is annoying. You'd need a linker filer to tell what two ROMs to use anyway.</div>
<br />
<br />More proof that you can't read. It says right in the official format guide that this is a CONTAINER format with a unique extension. A container is one file to load. Access to the prg or chr data does not require a special tool to offset, split, or recombine. Any commonplace archive tool that you already have will do.
<br />
<br />And on the surface, it seems like it wouldn't benefit you. Because you're the kind of user that downloads GoodNES and assumes integrity after playing the most popular games. It's not the popular games it gets wrong, but the obscure games. The type of game you might discover years down the road from the odd recommendation, and when you go to play it, it breaks, because no one made sure that it was good when people who actually gave a shit were still around.
<br />
<br />And that's why having data in a format that is easiest to obtain values from matters. Because it helps the people who butter your bread.</div>
