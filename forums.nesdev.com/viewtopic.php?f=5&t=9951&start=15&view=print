Depending on what you're trying to say in Japanese, you can often say it with less characters/glyphs, which means when it comes to devices with limited screen real-estate and so on, Japanese works well --  Chinese is the same way.  English tends to be lengthy or &quot;chatty&quot;, so you end up having to implement things like scrollable window regions, or start adding &quot;More...&quot; buttons.  It's all because English consists of 26 letters, while hiragana is 48 + katakana is 48 (and this doesn't include handakuten/dakuten, the small versions of ya/yu/yo, support for kanji, or any of the different marking glyphs used in Japanese (different comma, asterisk, period, etc.)).  Hangul is somewhere in between the two.<br /><br />There are so many embedded/solid-state devices out there with UIs which were engineered solely with the native language (ex. Japanese) in mind.  Other languages were added later, and more often than not, the programmers/engineers involved probably sat in a room thinking &quot;how the hell am I going to fit all this English text on here?  I can't!  And we don't have any more ROM space without forcing hardware upgrades at all the ATM/kiosk vendors!&quot;.<br /><br />Think of it this way: how many kiosk-like devices in North America do you see offering Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Portuguese?  I can think of only a handful, like the ATMs **at my bank** -- while the ATMs out in the field only offer English and sometimes Spanish.  The English+Spanish combo is significantly more common here in California compared to Oregon (where I'm originally from), although that's changing given the large influx of hispanics into Oregon; still to this day I remember being shocked at how much Spanish there was on products/menus/everything here compared to my home state.

But I also have another theory. It is also possible that the translation was done only with an initial version of the system software. Over all these years the software has been upgraded several times, adding more and more features in the process, but they didn't hire translators to do their jobs every time, so at the end they just removed the buttons whose label texts weren't translated in foreign languages.<br /><br />I'd also like to see the Chinese interface though. If it's mainly because of text length the Chinese version should still have most of the features.

If you want to advertise your business and stand out, do not just say you offer the best solutions and have some generic stock photo of someone smiling on the phone. With some of these places, it's like they just bought a generic business site and slapped their contact info on it. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Hojo_Norem wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Can I add to this?

And yeah, that was years ago that I did that. Luckily I don't have anything driving traffic to my site anyways, so it's really not hurting me. But I agree, it's not a good thing to do, <em>especially</em> if your site has built in functionality that the user needs to access that very day (e.g. anything with managing financial accounts).
