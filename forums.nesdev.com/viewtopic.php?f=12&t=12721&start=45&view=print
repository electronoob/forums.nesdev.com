That's why the Justifiers have one gun that plugs into the SNES and one gun that plugs into the other gun, rather than two identical guns that both plug into the SNES.

You had to toggle an ifdef that made the software non-GPL due to unrar's license, so it was off by default. Would probably have been smarter to not add .rar to the valid extensions when that wasn't compiled in.<br /><br />Not that I think anyone really cares about loading SNES ROMs in from RAR archives.

They used RAR instead of Zip because a solid archive can reuse repeated engine and sample data from one SPC to the next. At the time, 7-Zip didn't exist, and gzip's window size wasn't near enough to cover a game's SPC set. This left RAR.<br /><br />The same is true of archives containing a ROM and all its variants (Japan, North America, and Europe versions), though those are more likely to have gone to .7z.
