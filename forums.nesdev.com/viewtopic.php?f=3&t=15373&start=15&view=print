Some eastern games support a Subor Mouse. <em>Oeka Kids</em> has a tablet. But even in games that primarily use a standard controller, touch mode would be ideal for things like menus.

I noticed your project just a few days ago, and that you're also using LibGDX. As you see, GGVm makes absolutely no attempt at being cycle-accurate. The huge shortcuts I took make it fairly limited with respect to how many NES games it can play, but my focus was 100% on the homebrew community anyway whose needs are (in general) small subset of what the NES can do. The neat thing is, this gets me really good performance on the games it can support, even on somewhat oldish Android devices. I have a 3 year old Moto X I'm getting smooth 60fps play on. I'd be really curious to know whether a cycle accurate emulator in java could perform just as well on such devices...if it can, then I think you'd have an opportunity to provide something to the homebrew community which would be admittedly much superior to ggvm as no fiddling with adapters would be required to get a game up and running (I don't even do apu emulation). If not...then I'm hoping maybe somebody will put together a suite of native emulators for all the major platforms, and a shell for packaging up and encrypting a ROM with it, and include one totally permissive license with the whole thing. I'm not sure how feasible each idea is, and I definitely don't want to explore them myself, so until that time GGVm will be there for people I suppose <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

And I'm definitely watching this project with interest.<br /><br />The performance in ANy-Yes certainly suffers on lower-end devices, but I actually have a non-cycle-accurate CPU in development, and that one performs much better at the cost of some compatibility. I started on the faster core with android performance in mind, and intend to make a fast PPU as well.

For all I know ggvm would run decently on something older due to how little emulation it actually does. I'm well aware native emulators produce the best results; this project was the result of a &quot;what if...&quot; thought on my part and it wound up being useful to me and apparently quite a few others in the scene. I'd love to see something similar be made that is all native.<br /><br />Funny thing is though people throw out phones so fast it may be a moot point anyway...

The second barrier is doing this for several popular modern platforms. When I began on ggvm, I was not aware of any existing solution which could do this, and I don't think there are any others at the moment. I'll be the first to say I'd love to see this niche filled by a suite of native emulators (one for pc, mac, linux, android, ios) and some kind of tool that makes it easy to package up and encrypt a rom into a standalone. That'd be the ideal solution for what homebrewers need for publishing. Since emulation has already been pretty much perfected, if any emulator authors are looking for a niche, replacing ggvm with native emulators, equally permissive license, and no-hack convenience is definitely an opportunity for them. So far, the only solutions I am aware of involved forking over money or royalties to the emulator author. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I wanted to set myself and fellow homebrewers free of such obligations <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-Smooth 60fps play on pc systems up to ~8 years old</div><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You talk of a 3 year old Moto X as if it was a particularly underpowered device... but I used to play NES and Genesis games at full speed on a low end LG phone back back in 2012.</div><br />I used to play NES games full speed with Nesticle running on a 486 PC...</div><br /><br />I'm not that young you know <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I also used Nesticle, but on a Pentium 133. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">-Due to coding audio adapter, you can gut sound-engine.
