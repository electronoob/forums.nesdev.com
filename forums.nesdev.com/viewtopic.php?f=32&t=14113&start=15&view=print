Could be a sub-compo.  The top-three engines could possibly have a <a href="http://battleofthebits.org" class="postlink">Battle of the Bits</a> competition on top of them.<br /><br />Some examples would be PPU-out generated music, &quot;beeper&quot; engines, IRQ-heavy engines, etc.  Go wild!

There is only so much we can do about that..  Ultimately if we have the entries due the same time each year there wouldn't really be an official 'start date'.  Does the idea of having a 'half-way' submission in 3-4 months where some prizes would be distributed change anything in your mind?  You could consider that your deadline perhaps.  Nothing stopping you from making your own deadline and early submission if you know 7 months is too far away. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br />I don't think I would enter a &quot;half-way submission&quot; contest, due partly to my <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5921478/shhh-keeping-quiet-may-help-you-achieve-your-goals" class="postlink">belief that releasing work before it is finished kills motivation</a>, but that is just me and I am a curmudgeon.

That way we can have a theme to the compo if we choose, but not segregate the few entries we have.  I also like the idea of &quot;best first compo entry&quot; for people who are submitting an entry for the first time.</div><br />Bounties offered by non-organizers would be an interesting way to handle this. People would put up their own money for games/programs they'd like to see made, and then when the contest is over they would get to decide the winner of their prize.

Asides from having a cart of my own work to own and show my friends, I'd mostly just want to contribute to the compilation.<br /><br />I don't know how many copies the last one sold, but having a game on a well-distributed cart is a prize of itself. If somebody makes a simple NES game and puts the ROM online, there's a lot of work involved in getting people to know about it before anybody plays your work. Putting a cart on the compilation guarantees an audience. I'm also not sure about licensing issues, but I'm guessing that after somebody put a game on a compilation cart and it got a little popularity, that there wouldn't be a reason they couldn't then do a limited edition collectors cart, which the NintendoAge community loves.</div><br /><br />Exactly my thoughts.
