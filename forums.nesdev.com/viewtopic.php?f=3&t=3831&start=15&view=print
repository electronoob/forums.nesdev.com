I ran the test ROM and it got to the point where it was polling the PPU I think... problem I don't have any PPU code written yet.  Is there a way you could make the CPU test ROM store results in specified places in memory instead?
<br />
<br />Thanks for the ROM though... I've already found a few bugs trying to get it going.

<br />A multi-test ROM made of all the tests in source/. 'offical.nes' is the same, except the symbol OFFICIAL_ONLY is defined, which disables the unofficial instructions. The "multi" means it has a special shell that runs each individual test file's assembled output. Building such a multi-test wasn't simple enough to be worth releasing.

<br />BTW, I tried to build only one test. How can I build two or more tests, which sould be commited one by one (just bat file text will do just fine...)

<br />The only difference from undocumented_opcodes.txt is the Z flag. If Z was already set before ARR executes, then Z is cleared regardless of A. If Z was clear before ARR, then it's set based on A after ARR finishes.

I suspect that since the store value is affected by the upper byte of the target address (the "fixed" version, with 1 added to it), it's possible that a page crossing would also cause an issue with the upper address lines during the store cycle.</div>You're right. Not that I've verified this on the NES, but blargg_nes_cpu_test5 passes on my emu if I mask the high address byte with $00 if there's a page crossing on SYA or SXA. Simply ignoring the write on page crossing made it pass too. Though, ORing it with $700 on page crossing (making it sometimes write to $700 like blargg said), makes it fail.</div>
<br />
<br />Could it be that the index gets shifted to the right when crossing a boundary on those instruction? That would explain the behavior although the test set is too limited to tell for sure.

<br />
<br />Error 1 just gets printed whenever your emu fails a group opcodes, just ignore it, instead focus on what opcode that fails, the test tells you the opcode number that fails, it does not test instruction timing, although blargg has made another test that specifically tests timing, you can get it at his site.

<br />Thanks for the response.  I am afraid I still do not understand how to interpret the results.  The final part of the output displays:
<br />
<br />Errors:  10
<br />Failed
<br />
<br />Does this mean that opcode $10, BPL, failed?  I am confused because it also happens that it says I am failing each of the 10 groups, and I don't see any other indicator that could be interpreted as an opcode.
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />Is the list of opcodes displayed in each section showing those that failed?  That would make the most sense, but that would also mean that most, if not all, of my opcodes are failing, which I'm hoping is not the case.

<br />That doesn't make any sense...there are so many opcodes printed that I couldn't possibly have a working emulator if that were the case.
<br />
<br />Implied NOP is listed as failing...and about 20 other implied instructions (DEX, DEY, INX, INY)  
<br />
<br />I must be a complete idiot.
<br />
<br />EDIT: I thought perhaps a failing opcode would have an asterisk next to it or something...but couldn't see anything like that in the output.
<br />
<br />Perhaps we should let the test author explain it?  I do not at all intend to suggest that his test is bunk...

<br />
<br />I understand what you mean.  My emulator seemed to be working almost completely with a couple of games and it passed all nestest.nes tests, but listed massive failures in Blargg's CPU test.  I assumed at first that it was listing each opcode tested.
<br />
<br />I figured out what the problem with mine was though.  I was not setting status flags 5 and 6 properly for NMI/BRK/PHP.  Since the status register is included in all of the checksums, a single incorrect bit can through all of the tests off.  Once I fixed those according to a thread I found searching these boards, nearly all of my tests passed and only a few opcodes were listed.
