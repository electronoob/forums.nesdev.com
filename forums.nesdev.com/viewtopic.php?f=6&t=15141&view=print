It could be better, but that's beyond me. This already took way more time than I thought it would, even if it was pretty fun to do. The frame thing on the left is terribly unoptimized, (way too many distinct frames for how repetitive the song is) but I don't care. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />Here's the .ogg file and the .ftm file.

(it wasn't nearly bombastic enough, all though I don't think it will ever be possible to get to that level.) I'll work on that. I was going crazy listening to the thing over and over again for small details. How anyone can replicate a more complicated song with the VRC6 or something like that is beyond me.<br /><br />I wasn't way to eager about using the triangle channel on the beginning and last parts, (high pitch noises on the triangle channel sound like crap to me, it's better for more background like stuff but there's not enough polyphony. Also, it's annoying there's no volume control on it for some reason, because it's too loud here) but oh well. It would be stupid to use something like the VRC6 when you already have the perfect number of channels.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hummer Team is 1000x worse. The high pitched triangle wave they use at the forefront of all of their songs is really ear grating. The main problem with Action 52's music (at least going off of Cheetahmen) is the lack of polyphony. Of course, I could be bias, especially considering my creation apparently sounds like it's from Action 52. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />The graphics, on the other hand... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />For any who were wondering, the song is the stage 1 theme of Raiden: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH2Rk7csm8g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH2Rk7csm8g</a><!-- m --> I will admit, I really have no clue how to replicate the sounds very well. I tried messing with the pitch thing, but it seems useless.

(Hydro Thunder is the main exception; I love that game.) I played Raiden DX before I ever even heard of Raiden, and I actually found it at a restaurant called &quot;Lago Mar Pizza&quot; at Virginia Beach. It had to have been a good while ago, because I remember being surprised that it didn't work in MAME. (It was probably the last &quot;major&quot; game to be added.)<br /><br />Kind of random, but I found that if I ever change the &quot;Duty&quot; of an instrument in a loop, it will periodically make an obnoxious clicking noise. Is that because of my speakers, or does it actually sound like that?
