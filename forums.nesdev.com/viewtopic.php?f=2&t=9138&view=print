<br />
<br />I just returned home from overseas, and there was a package waiting for me (it's been sitting at my house for almost 9 months now). Inside was 4 Dragon Ball Z Famicom titles. I purchased them in 2011 hoping to put the translations on them from romhacking.com, my question being, I can't find any datasheets or pin layouts for this Mask Rom is it. 
<br />
<br />(The mask roms only say BANDAI with a datecode, however bootgods site has them as a NEC UPD23C2012 T77 and W01). 
<br />

<br />
<br />Any help would be great. I'll continue looking, from what I'm told, someone said they are similar to typical eprom and shouldn't need changed (rewired).
<br />
<br />I'm going to try to do one tonight and see what happens. Trying the PGM first.
<br />
<br />thank you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My suggestion would be to leave the PRG memory as the original.  I would attempt to figure out the wiring using the CHR memory only.  Since they are both 256KB with same pin count presumably the pinout matches between the two (even though it doesn't for most Nintedo mask ROMs).  That way the game won't freeze, it'll just have bad graphics.  depending on how you wire up the ROM you could make it easy to quickly test dozens of wiring combinations.  Kind of a brute force method but it may work.<br /><br />The other &quot;work smarter not harder&quot; means is to take the original ROM and dump them via a EEPROM burner/reader.  Just assume the standard pinout and compare the binary dumped files against a known good ROM.  The patterns you'll find will allow you to figure out what pins are miswired.  It's easier said than done especially if you've never trouble shot such things, but really the best way to do it.
