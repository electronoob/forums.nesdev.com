		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The nes.lib that you can get with CC65 is not very useful, I don't recommend it.<br /><br />Shiru made a version of it that he distributed with his NES C tutorial. It is better.<br /><br />You can use &quot;ar65 l nes.lib&quot; so see the object files contained in the library, in this library there will be one function contained in each object file, but that's just because of the convention. I'm not sure how to look at the exported symbols in an object file or library from cc65 (does anyone know?).<br /><br />Basically, the nes.lib should contain the necessary C runtime implementation to support the C compiler, plus some NES specific startup stuff, plus whatever useful NES specific functions shiru or whomever wanted to put inside there.<br /><br />In my own stuff, I use a CRT library built from the stuff in libsrc/runtime/ (minus condes.s, stkchk.s, callirq.s, and callmain.s) plus libsrc/common/copydata.s from the CC65 libraries, and then I wrote my own custom NES startup stuff which also went in there. I used it to make a music ROM for John Coltrane's giant steps.

But using a lib for some helper functions that encapsulate the behavior of the NES and that I can call in my code, that's not what I want because I want to write those things all by myself.<br /><br />So, when I link the &quot;nes.lib&quot;, what will end up in my NES file?<br /><br />Will the dozens of functions that are included in the &quot;nes.lib&quot; be included in the final ROM? Or are only functions that are actually used somewhere in the code linked in the end?<br /><br />What happens if I or the compiler that converts my C files to ASM files uses the &quot;import&quot; command to make a function from the lib known to my code, but that function is never actually used? Will that function be included in the NES file?

Actually technically cc65 only does this at module (source code file) level, but the platform libraries like nes.lib have every function in a separate file so it works as you'd expect.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What happens if I or the compiler that converts my C files to ASM files uses the &quot;import&quot; command to make a function from the lib known to my code, but that function is never actually used? Will that function be included in the NES file?</div><br />This is only a guess, but I'd guess an .import statement is enough for the function/module to be included into the build. (Reasoning: sometimes it would make sense to ensure a certain module is imported, without using anything from that module)<br /><br />The C compiler will never generate .import statements unless you use &quot;extern&quot;, or it needs one of the compiler support functions (for things such as parameter passing/retrieval, multiplication, etc).

The reason is to know what is inside rather than use a black box and to exclude all unwanted stuff (lib size is reduced well).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />For the most part, no, there is not much that is NES specific in the nes.lib that you can get with CC65. The common CRT is the bulk of it. There is some NES specific stuff, but the kind of stuff they have in CC65's nes.lib is kinda garbage for game making purposes. It's purpose is to help port CC65 programs from other platforms to NES, and they're not designed around game making at all, really.<br /><br />That's why you should use shiru's cut down nes.lib, or build your own like what I suggested (basically what's in the runtime folder with a few additions/removals). The set I used for my coltrane.nes project is basically the bare minimum needed to support CC65's C compiler, and all the NES specific stuff is in other assembly files I wrote for that project.<br /><br />Here's the list of what I put in my CRT library:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">libsrc/runtime/*.*<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Makefile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - condes.s (removed to disable .constructor/.destructor functionality, which required self modifying code)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - stkchk.s (removed because it was the only crt module with a .constructor)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - callirq.s (IRQs should be handled manually in assembly)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - callmain.s (main is void(), arguments are irrelevant on NES)<br />libsrc/common/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; + copydata.s (needed to copy DATA segment to RAM)</div><br /><br />See the crt0.s in my project for additional startup code needed to initialize the CC65 C runtime (it is very minimal, just need to setup the stack pointer and call the copydata routine from common). The other thing you need is a linker configuration that has the segments required by the C runtime, of which you can look at my nrom.cfg for an example.

This part of code is normally called 'runtime.lib' (the source folder is called like this), so I probably should rename it after removing the unneeded NES-related stuff.<br /><br />Edit: well, in fact, I did rename the lib into runtime.lib. The original nes.lib (602K) from CC65 was provided with Alter Ego and Zooming Secretary, but in the C examples and Chase it is runtime.lib (104K). Completely forgot about it.
