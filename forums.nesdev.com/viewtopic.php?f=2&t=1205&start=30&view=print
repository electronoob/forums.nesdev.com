Small things (such like a standard tileset) doesn't need to be compressed, because it slows the process time, the game developpement time and doesn't spare that much space.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Forgive me, but GFX compression IS very important. The graphics used by a level can eat as much space as it's map, depending on the game. I'm designing a game where all (about 12) level maps TOGETHER use only 8KB (they are somewhat compressed). That's the same as 1 full tileset (512 tiles).
<br />
<br />If you are using CHR-ROM of course that is not even a discussion, you'll not be using compression for the tiles. But if you were to use CHR-RAM, you woudn't want all those tiles stealing huge chunks of your PRG/DATA space.
<br />
<br />On other gaming systems, such as the SNES or the Megadrive/Genesis, that must use RAM for tilesets, games almost always compress their tiles.
<br />
<br />I some times consider GFX compression more important than level map compression, as it has less impact on performance. You'll most likely decompress only once, before the level starts, while levels must be partially decoded all the time, as the player moves, due to memory restrictions.
<br />
<br />I'm in favour of encoding the levels in more compact ways, yes, but not with general compression, 'cause that makes it harder to have random access to parts of the map without huge tables of pointers, that kinda go against the purpose of compression.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The SNES and Megadrive/Genesis have 4BPP tiles, while the NES have 2BPP tiles. The SNES hold up to 1024 BG tiles and 1024 sprites tiles in one single tileset, while the NES have only 256 of each. The space of tiles loaded in a single BG or sprite tileset is 4kb for the NES, and 32kb for the SNES, so 8 times larger.
<br />So, the space taken by SNES graphics is much larger, so compress them becomes more significant.
<br />If you have large, large amount of tiles in a game, yeah, it's meningfull to compress them, but not for a small game where you only have a few tilesets.
<br />You often have more maps than tilesets (sound logical, right ?), so you'd normally compress maps over tilesets.
<br />
<br />Tough, one big advantage of compressing tilesets over maps is that you don't have to buffer the whole chunk to ram, just write it to $2007 directly in the decompression routine. This of course go hell if you want to animate tiles.

<br />But the cost in dollars per megabit of replicating a program was greater in the NES era.
