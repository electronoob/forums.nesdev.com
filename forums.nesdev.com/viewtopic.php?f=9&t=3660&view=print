		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone,
<br />
<br />I have just recently got into the into the whole nes hardware thing and have spent heaps of $$$ on a burner, eproms, and eraser, doners etc and have got sh*t to so show for it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Ok, so first i tried making a Earthbound zero cart per these instructions
<br />
<br />Earthbound Zero:
<br />- Board required: NES-TKROM-10 (Tecmo Basketball works)
<br />- Use 2 D27C2001D-15 or equivalents
<br />- Remove mask roms
<br />- Bend up pin 1, 2, 24 &amp; 30 on PRG eprom
<br />- Solder into place of the masked rom.
<br />- Tie pins 1 &amp; 32 together (+5)
<br />- Tie pins 22 &amp; 24 together
<br />- Tie pin 2 &amp; pin 24 hole together
<br />- Tie pin 30 &amp; pin 1 hole together
<br />- Bend up pins 1, 2, 22, 24, 30 &amp; 31 on CHR eprom
<br />- Solder into place of the masked rom.
<br />- Tie pins 1, 31 &amp; 32 together (+5)
<br />- Tie pin 30 &amp; pin 1 hole together
<br />- Tie pin 24 &amp; pin 2 hole together
<br />- Tie pin 2 &amp; pin 24 hole together
<br />- Tie pin 22 &amp; pin 31 hole together
<br />
<br />
<br />It was the first time i had soldered anything so i wasn't suprised when it didn't work.
<br />
<br />Then i tried the mod on this page <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://beigerecords.com/cory/Things_I_Made_in_2003/mario_clouds_2005.html">http://beigerecords.com/cory/Things_I_M ... _2005.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />To avoid the whole mess of desoldering i simply snipped the old chip then soldered the the new one onto the old legs And it worked!!
<br />
<br />So with my new confidence i tried another Eb zero and it still doesn't work and i have no clue why.
<br />
<br />I burnt the new chips  and soldered them onto the existing snipped legs and lifted and soldered the legs as per the guide.
<br />
<br />i even went out and bought a multi meter to test it and everythings connecting properly  ( although the mutli meter takes slightly longer with some of the connections).
<br />
<br />I have never felt so frustrated in my life so and help/advice is really appreciated

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't recomment soldering to old pins.  You need to remove the old lets, so you see holes, and then drop/solder eprom in place.
<br />
<br />Since these boards are double sided, some traces are on one side, and some are on the other.  Even though you verified with a voltmeter, it means nothing.  I've seen verified connections that are good enough for the voltmeter, but not good enough for the actual eprom chip!
<br />
<br />Also, you gotta use good wire.  30 guage single strand wire, which some people use, is junk and should be avoided.  If you don't have access to good wire, take an old PC floppy cable and use the strands of wire from there.
<br />
<br />Keep the wire as short as possible.

<br />
<br />Then before you solder in a socket (low profile is best so you won't have to dremel the case) either cut and re-route the proper traces or bend out the proper pins to connect to the proper traces. Take your time and spend a lot of time checking each connection.
<br />
<br />In the end you'll have a much more reliable devcart. Also it's nice to be able to take the EPROM's out to reprogram them.

<br />I find useing desoldering braid works better for removeing these types of things its cheaper and better for this propose

<br />if some of my connections take a bit longer to connect on the multi meter does thing mean there bad? ie
<br />
<br />when x pin is read the multi meter instantly gives a beep
<br />
<br />while y pin takes a few seconds

<br />You might be connecting across a capacitor in case Y. Or just not piercing through the rosin flux on the surface of the solder at first. What resistance do you measure across Y? What if you reverse the meter probes (connect red where you had black, and vice-versa)?

<br />btw i did make a tsrom socket cart that i think works, will eb run off tsrom

<br />
<br />the only thing i got happening was a flashing brown, green and pink screen which stoped anyway after i switched it off. 
<br />
<br />
<br />maybe its something with how im splitting/burning the rom...
<br />
<br />im using the earthbound prototype rom, removing the header with a hex editor, then seperating it with windows command tool which leaves me with 3 files,  prg chr and crc   
<br />
<br />ive only been burning the prg and chr, is the crc important?
