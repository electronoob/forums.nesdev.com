		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It has been said a gazillion times before that slow code is the result of short development time.  However I think slow code has more to do with programmer's <em>style</em> more than his time constraints.
<br />
<br />Here is an example of slow code:
<br />
<br />lda #$00
<br />sta $2115
<br />lda #$11
<br />sta $2116  ;; load v-ram address port with some random number
<br />lda #$22
<br />sta $2117
<br />lda #$33  ;; set up the DMA registers with random shit
<br />sta $4300
<br />lda #$44
<br />sta $4301
<br />lda #$55
<br />sta $4302
<br />lda #$66
<br />sta $4303
<br />lda #$77
<br />sta $4304
<br />lda #$88
<br />sta $4305
<br />lda #$99
<br />sta $4306
<br />lda #$01
<br />sta $420b
<br />
<br />Now here is a faster version of the same code
<br />
<br />rep #$20
<br />ldx #$00
<br />stx $2115
<br />lda #$2211
<br />sta $2116  ;; load v-ram address port with some random number
<br />lda #$4433
<br />sta $4300    ;; set up the DMA registers with random shit
<br />lda #$6655
<br />sta $4302
<br />ldx #$77
<br />stx $4304
<br />lda #$9988
<br />sta $4305
<br />ldx #$01
<br />stx $420b
<br />
<br />Okay, which looks like it takes longer to write?  The faster one?  If developers were concerned about taking the least amount of time writing codes, why did a lot of them choose the first method?  Probably because it was just their style and didn't pay attention to it.
<br />
<br />Your probably thinking, "Oh that is just a little piece of code, that can't possibly cause slowdown by itself."  Yes, your right, it is a little piece of code and it isn't contributing very much to slowdown.
<br />
<br />The thing is, when you have millions and millions of little pieces of slow code, it causes slowdown, and you can't fix it by optimizing any single one of those million little pieces of slow code by itself.  You'd have to fix all of them.  That takes forever and you wouldn't have had that problem if you'd just programmed fast the first time around.
<br />
<br />If anybody here ever runs into that problem, instead of waiting till the end to nitpick millions of lines of code, a better way is making a habbit of optimizing your code as your writing it.  It's good to optimize code by auto-pilot, so you don't have to intentionally think about it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I both agree and disagree with your sentiments.  You need to take into consideration the experience level of the programmer.  Most people tend to write assembly code that isn't optimal during the first past (think of it as a first draft) and then go back and adjust things as needed.  Hell, I've been doing 65xxx since the late 80s and I still write code this way.
<br />
<br />You also need to keep in mind context.  Your code example has no context; is this run within a loop?  Within NMI?  Etc..  If it's only done during RESET, who cares?  A perfect example is some of the first-generation SNES initialisation code that circulated during the early 90s when the SNES development scene started; it wasn't optimised, but it was an initialisation routine, so who cared?  I wrote a "more optimised" version of it, but then I thought about it for a while and determined... why bother?  This really isn't optimisation given its context.
<br />
<br />It's like running around with x86 assembly changing "mov ax,0" into "xor ax,ax" and claiming you're optimising everything.
<br />
<br />Additionally, there's the need to comment such changes like your example.  It should be ""obvious"" to anyone looking at it, but a simple comment can make all the difference when someone who didn't write it has to read it.
<br />
<br />I'm not trying to battle with you or argue -- honest.  I'm just saying that if your above optimisation example isn't a very good validator of your point, given that there's no context surrounding it.
<br />
<br />Ease up, don't judge, and remember that different people have different experience levels.  :-)

<br />
<br />Is there any other example of first gen code that wasn't optimized?  I've always wondered why early games slowdown so easily, but nobody gave me a straight answer on the specifics.
<br />
<br />What percentage of CPU time was used for different routines?  Collision, metasprite building, scrolling etc.
<br />
<br />Was there any 6502 code left over from the NES days?
<br />
<br />Was anything written in C, or translated from 68000 ASM?
<br />
<br />Was most of the CPU time spent on AI and physics, or was most of the CPU spent on overhead work that is done every frame regardless of how much is onscreen?

<br />Probably everything by Koei, and possibly SimCity given that Micropolis (the simulation engine in SimCity) was written in C.

If I remember right (Neill if you're lingering please correct me :-) ), Neill had done some disassembly work but wasn't able to pinpoint exactly where all the time was being spent.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The slowdown actually helps at some points in the game as it gives you more time to react when all hell is breaking loose. However sometimes the slowdown is not consistent and it can get you killed when speed suddenly returns to normal. If someone could hack Gradius 3 to reduce or remove the slowdown it would be a neat hack to play.

<br />The NES version of Parodius is just crazy, it almost constantly lags if you have any option and if there is any enemy on the screen. How when the games jumps form lagging 1 frame (most common) to 2 frames, or 0 frames, it makes a sudden gameplay speed change, and this is pretty terrible to deal with.
<br />
<br />Why Konami didn't speed up their routine / place less enemies on the screen when they noticed a systematical lag is beyond me. You'd expect such a well kown game company to do that.

I know on the PCE, they (Konami) have some poor optimizations in certain aspects of games (like sprite management and such), yet have clever higher level designs (like dynamic tiles). I think it's safe to say that Konami wasn't worried above speed or slow down. Maybe it's a Japanese developer thing? (Back then)

<br />The conversation I had with Neill indicated that the slowdown was intentional -- meaning the game, somewhere/somehow, was intentionally slowing the system down to increase the player's chance of survival.

<br />
<br />At first he couldn't understand how I did it while he got killed all the time, but then he figured it out: I was pressing the fire button repeatedly even when there were no enemies on the screen - this slowed the game down sufficiently that getting through those obstacles became much easier.

<br />It's probably better to get a consistent 30 FPS than something randomly inbetween 30 and 60 FPS based on CPU usage. It could be they noticed that some parts of the game were too CPU intensive and put flags in there to deliberately make it 30 FPS in those parts.
