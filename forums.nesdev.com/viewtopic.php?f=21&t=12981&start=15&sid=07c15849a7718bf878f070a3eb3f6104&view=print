The brightness difference may force rearranging colors all over the place though.

The exception is that &quot;dark white&quot; is instead #C0C0C0, and &quot;bright black&quot; is instead #808080.<br /><br />Windows 3 on an EGA card can't do that; it only has a 6 bit (2 bits per channel) DAC. (in the monitor, in fact) ... but I can't find a reference of what values they use instead. (The only real question is whether the 50% brightness shades are 33% or instead 67%; the rest maps obviously)<br /><br />Note: EGA has two different palettes. One's very similar to the SMS's palette, (any 16 colors out of a 64-color master palette) but only works in 350-scanline modes. (Scanline doubling <strong>is</strong> available on the EGA: a weird 320x175 mode could have been made, but I've never seen anyone do it). The other is identical to CGA's text mode (on the 5153 monitor) but only works in 200-scanline modes.

I set up 350-line text mode with 3 lines per tile, giving 80x117 tile map. Then I used the half-and-half glyph to split each tile down the middle into two pixels, giving 160x117 very nearly square pixels. That's roughly in the same size class as Odyssey 2, Atari 2600 games with a 2-line kernel, Game (Boy|Gear), and Lynx.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you set up the standard 43-line EGA text mode and fill it with colons, then you have both an 80x86 processor and an 80×86 grid of dots on the screen.

I never liked the Windows one myself. The colors are way too standardized, to even consider making color ramps for the NES palette.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, guys! Sorry for the delay. Today, I'll show you the EGA color palette.<br /><br />Original NES Palette:<br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/NES%20Palette_zpsztntx2v5.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />NES-EGA Palette:<br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/NES-EGA%20palette_zpsjdkkobls.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This palette had to go through a lot of fine-tuning. Since the colors are more defined, it's not easy to make color ramps. Unlike the Commodore 64 palette, where gray can often be used to &quot;link&quot; the colors in the ramps, here it's used rarely. I also had a lot of trouble with the warm colors, since yellow is one of the brightest colors in the palette and I wanted it to replace the skin colors, but then it became hard to find a color for the darkest shades and to have a unique color ramp for each hue. The result is not perfect, but I think, I kinda pulled it off. Anyway, here are the screenshots:<br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/01%20-%20Alien%203%20and%20Arumana%20no%20Kiseki_zpsgpkiv41z.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/02%20-%20Batman%20and%20Battletoads%20amp%20Double%20Dragon_zpsfxiiv7ei.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/03%20-%20Bionic%20Commando%20and%20Castlevania_zpsfvqsejlh.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/04%20-%20Castlevania%20II%20and%20Akumajou%20Densetsu_zpsit58tj8r.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/05%20-%20Choujin%20Sentai%20Jetman%20and%20Contra_zpshq2mpseh.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The Red Ranger in &quot;Choujin Sentai Jetman&quot; is now brown! Oh, well... The Yellow Ranger is now... yellow, which is good.<br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/06%20-%20Devilman%20and%20G%20I%20Joe_zpsvklg7ols.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Interestingly enough, &quot;Devilman&quot; looks much better than with the previous palettes. Yes, the human characters have gray skin and Ryo Asuka's hair is white now, instead of blond, but other than that, the game looks fine. &quot;G. I. Joe&quot; also looks great, but that is to be expected.<br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/07%20-%20Gargoyles%20Quest%20II%20and%20Godzilla_zps5ccbskwe.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/08%20-%20Journey%20to%20Silius%20and%20Kickmaster_zpsdjiwvcr7.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/09%20-%20Mega%20Man%20II%20and%20Mega%20Man%20III_zpszl5iohxe.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/10%20-%20A%20Nightmare%20on%20Elm%20Street%20and%20Ninja%20Gaiden_zps0h4lkn12.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Once again &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; looks great, with the exception of the gray skin colors. &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; also looks a lot better, than it did with the C64 color palette.<br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/11%20-%20Shatterhand%20and%20Snakes%20Revenge_zpst5hzczay.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />&quot;Snake's Revenge&quot; ends up with a very gray jungle, but that's due to the fact, that dark gray is one of the darkest colors in the EGA palette.<br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/12%20-%20Street%20Fighter%202010%20and%20Super%20C_zpsqimzcy49.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Let's see how &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; looks.<br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/13%20-%20Super%20Mario%20Bros.%20and%20Super%20Mario%20Bros.%202_zpsmqhfviif.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Well, we have a very brown-looking Mario. Having the Fireflower once again helps. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; doesn't look as good, as I expected it would, but it's still not bad.<br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/14%20-%20Super%20Mario%20Bros.%203%20and%20Sweet%20Home_zpstmyzjtkg.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; is also fine, but we have a white sky.<br /><br /><img src="http://i34.photobucket.com/albums/d130/AlienX97/15%20-%20Metroid%20and%20Mike%20Tyson-s%20Punch%20Out_zpswv1fzn5t.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />So that was the NES-EGA color palette. It was definitely hard to adapt the NES colors, but in my opinion, the results are relatively good. Next time, I'll show you the Amstrad-CPC palette.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The results are surprisingly good! I feel like the games retained the &quot;NES feel&quot; much better than with the other palettes, but at the same time ended up looking much better than most real EGA games from back in the day. Maybe it's because most EGA artists didn't mix the colors much, but opted to stick with the obvious combinations. This is actually an insight on how we can improve our own NES art... instead of sticking to the obvious gradients, we should try shading, highlighting and dithering with non-obvious colors more often.

There were however some EGA games, that knew how to use the colors properly and, in result look fantastic. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> But, yeah, experimenting with colors and using different hues in one color ramp, can result in some great looking graphics. There were games, late in the NES's lifespan, that did this and pulled it off really well. &quot;Kick Master&quot; is one example, that comes to mind.

Maybe I'll try adapting that palette in the future. About the green shades: red wouldn't work, because red and green compliment each other, so the dark red will stick out a lot, when put near the green colors and it wouldn't make a good color ramp. Dark blue could work, but I decided to go with grey, because it still makes a nice color ramp.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I noticed on the Wikipedia page of 'list of video game console palettes' it says they can't show an example of their colorful parrot with the NES palette, due to system constraints...that sounds like a challenge to me.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of ... e_palettes</a><!-- m -->
