		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi
<br />
<br />I've recently bought a PAL NES and fortunatly it's lockout chip was already disabled so I could play NTSC games. However, there are some problems with the NTSC games and ONLY on NTSC games which made me nerveous. Here are some pictures:
<br />
<br />1- On Zelda 2, the intro screen is al screwed up:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/filozof/zeldaproblem1.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />But you can start the game without any problems. However, look at the upper screen. The Magic bar and Life bar are all screwed up and they flicker constantly:
<br />
<br /><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/filozof/zeldaproblem2.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />2- On Castlevania, there's a smilar problem with the upper menu not moving with the character. Here are some images:
<br />

<br />
<br /><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/filozof/castlevania2.jpg" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />3- Also, a main problem on all NTSC games is that the music of the games are MUCH slower than the ones on PAL. I own both NTSC and PAL SMB3 and on NTSC, the music is almost half speed of PAL one. It's all same with all my NTSC games..
<br />
<br />I know this isn't the exact place to tell these problems but I'm very desperate and I need to find out what's wrong with my NES. Otherwise I'm going to buy a new one..
<br />
<br />Thanks  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />Not all NTSC games will play fine on any PAL NES (regardless of lockout chip considerations), because they have been timed to run on a NTSC NES. I recommand you to play those games under an accurate emulator and run the (U) image in PAL mode and see if you get similar results. If so, then it's just normal that the game bugs.
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3- Also, a main problem on all NTSC games is that the music of the games are MUCH slower than the ones on PAL. I own both NTSC and PAL SMB3 and on NTSC, the music is almost half speed of PAL one. It's all same with all my NTSC games..<br /></div>
<br />That's because PAL has slower refresh rate (50Hz), so music will play 5/6 slower than original. Early cames (Castlevania) did just not bother about that, so the music is effectivly slower and a half-key lower than it's NTSC counterpart. But later games (SMB3 and many others) did adjust their sound code constant arrays so that the music plays *faster* on the PAL version, so that will more or less compensate the 5/6 slowdown. They also play one half-key higher to compensate the fact that the music is a half-key lower on PAL. So this way the music played with the NTSC version on the NTSC NES will sound similar that the music played with the PAL version on a PAL NES. Now playing the NTSC verison on a PAL NES will have slower and lower music, and playing the PAL verison on a NTSC NES or an innacurate emulator will have higher and faster music.
<br />
<br />So as a conculsion, always fist download your NTSC games and play them under an accurate emulator (nestopia, nintendulator) in PAL mode to see if the issues are tolerable. Sometimes nothing will change aside the music, sometimes just small tolerable glitch, and sometimes there will be so many glitches that the game will be unplayable (aka Final Fantasy where the textboxes doesn't show up completely or Rad Racer where the whole screen is scrolled trough timed code).
<br />
<br />NB : If you found a PAL Castlevania cart the music will still play slower anyway, only the status bar won't scroll.

<br />But it doesn't sound like 5/6 speed at all, more like half speed. Wish I could record it somehow, and you would understand it much better. 
<br />
<br />I also have 2 versions of Zelda 1 and NTSC one works just fine without any graphical errors but it also has the sound problem. But the thing is, the gameplay speed seems to be just fine, it's just the music that's too slow.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It *could* be half-speed if the game would be screwed for a frame out of two (and such things can happen, typically if the game starts to wait for sprite-zero hit after it hit so it wait a whole frame), but then not only the sound will be slower, but also the screen will mostly flicker and the gameplay will be slower, too.
<br />I think it's just 5/6 speed and that your bain exagerate the thing. 5/6 makes quite some noticeable difference, much more than what it sounds on paper. Just play Castlevania under an emulator in PAL mode, and see if the results are comparable to the issues on your real NES.

<br />
<br />So there's absolutly no way those games are going to work like they do on NTSC system right ? Even with the Game Genie ?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, for Castlevania no because the PAL cartridge also play slower muic. But most recent games fixed the problem, so I'd recommand you try to get PAL games in priority.
<br />You could just romhack Castlevania (E) to play faster and higher music, and then burn your own EPROM with that version on it and rewire the original UNROM cart per your new version of the game.
