Well I got my little test rig set up and checked some things and found some interesting stuff.<br /><br />So since I was able to do some testing that isn't possible I was able to peer deeper into the MMC1 and figure out how some things REALLY work.  I'll discuss what's relevant to the post, but plan to implement more detail post with my official MMC1 design as accurate as it can be from an external standpoint.<br /><br />The thing I was checking mostly was the double writes.  So it appears that in ANY consecutive sequence of writes (to anywhere) ONLY the FIRST write is acknowledged.  So if you do something like write to the ROM once, then write to any address for multiple cycles ALL subsequent writes are ignored.  Also if you toggle PRG R/W between writes it will still ignore subsequent writes (nothing is being clocked by PRG R/W.  So as for your test rom it would appear that my original guess should be right.  I'll get it burned on a EEPROM and verify soon though.<br /><br />Interestingly enough if you don't clock M2 the subsequent writes aren't ignored.  They are all accepted.<br /><br />So this doesn't matter much as far as emulation goes because you can't write more than 2 clock cycles in a row.  Nor can you operate without M2 cycling.  But from what I can see it appears that there is a state machine that is clocked by M2.  And it will only allow writes if the previous cycle was had PRG R/W high.  And so if you don't clock the statemachine with M2 then it's stuck in "allow writes" state and will accept consecutive writes.<br /><br />But like I've said none of this matters much for emulator or hardware emulation of the MMC1 because it's impossible to do the things I did when running/emulating the NES.  But it does answer my question to as whether or not Nintendo ignores the second write intentionally.  Based on what I found it's pretty obvious they did, and I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.  So while it the knowledge might not be of much value it was a fun puzzle to solve and my design wasn't too far off from the original <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I still have a few things to check before I'm certain about everything but so far that's what makes sense to me.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Mon Mar 19, 2012 1:31 am</p><hr />

Okay so I've got a basic test rig setup to toggle individual pins on the MMC1 and check it's response.<br /><br />I'm using my kazzo hardware with my own version of the firmware.  I basically write up a binary file of how I want the pins to change, (control, address, data, control, repeat).  Then I program it quickly to the kazzo the same way I program files to the NESDEV1.  So it's super quick to modify the test sequence on my PC and then run the MMC1 through the sequence.  All I do is hit save in the hex editor and click write in my programmer app, and it's stimulating the MMC1.  I can quickly apply a lengthy sequence without operating anything or single step each 'command step' with a toggle switch.  Right now I'm just sensing outputs with a scope.  But I might wire up some leds or something so I can see things easily.<br /><br />I played around with a little bit already doing some basic stuff.  I'm running a MMC1B1 off of a SEROM board from Tetris.<br /><br />(EDIT: removed some wrong stuff about prg bank at startup)<br /><br />Over the next couple days I'll try out applying different sequences of signals.  Should be able to find out things like if the double write has anything to do with PRG R/W staying low, and what things are being clocked by etc.  Let me know if there is anything specific you'd like me to test out.  I'll be testing out the double writes first.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Fri Mar 16, 2012 3:40 am</p><hr />

Good to me, although it should maybe have wram disableable. But that means all the banks are switching in so more than likely everything is A okay. Run in nintendoulator to see what happens when you emulate incorrectly. It doesn't use any INC's in the ROM to reset the mapper or anything, but those tests could be added.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Thu Mar 15, 2012 7:54 pm</p><hr />

I'm interested in better characterizing how this thing is works exactly.  If all goes well I should be able to apply signals without the NES and see how it responds to individual signal changes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Thu Mar 15, 2012 11:12 am</p><hr />

I think I already have a MMC1 (SNROM) devcard ready so I should be able to easily test this behavior. It's just that I need some way to print the result to the screen, but this should be trivial.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Thu Mar 15, 2012 11:08 am</p><hr />
