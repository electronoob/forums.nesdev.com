OK, so, NES controllers (in addition to Genesis, Super NES, and a number of other systems) work by pressing a button which in turn completes the circuit for the respective button and causes the button press to be interpreted by the game console as "pressed".  Therefore, it is my theory that soldering directly to each side of the "teeth" on the circuit board and then attaching each side to a true arcade button to complete the circuit when pressed should work.  Has anyone done it this way before? I got the idea from the giant NES pad, only they soldered to a different part on the NES controller circuit board and I was wondering why they chose to do it on the backside rather than in the place each button occupies on the front.  If this would work for an NES, I figure it would also work for a Sega Genesis and Super NES as well.  I was even thinking of including a 3-position switch to go between each system and make it multi-platform.  Also, does anyone know if there are authentic arcade joysticks that only utilize digital presses rather than an analog signal? As in, switches for all cardinal directions that can also read diagonally.  I just want to make a simple project to occupy my time over the summer and I've always wanted a quality joystick to fill the void left by the NES Advantage with its creaky joystick and floppy buttons.  Also, if anyone has info on where to buy various arcade inputs like joysticks and buttons, etc. let me know as well.  Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3414">17daysolderthannes</a> — Mon Jan 28, 2008 5:14 pm</p><hr />
