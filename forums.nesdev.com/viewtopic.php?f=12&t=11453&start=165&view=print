I've tested only writing/erasing the E0h chip yet (and didn't expect any differences for the C0h chip). The FLASH chips should be same (and wired up the same), and the MX15001 probably can't prevent hidden writes (that would require it to be able to separate between normal &amp; hidden flash writes). So I think that problem could be only due to different initialization of the flash chips.<br /><br />If it's working with D0h but not with C0h... that sounds a bit as if the sector protect flag for the normal flash sector at C0h-C1h might also prevent accessing the hidden sector in that area... did you try clearing the sector protect flag? It's set by default/by nintendo, so you may need to clear it - and best keep it cleared forever since it's only disturbing normal writes (and maybe also hidden writes).<br /><br />Problems with clearing the sector protect flag normally shouldn't happen - did you get that working, sanni? And released the /WP pin before doing so?

I'm using CMD 0x02 to unlock /WP, both /WP's of two flashchips are connected together and using CMD 0x02 does have an effect on the second flashchip as without it I can't erase the sector protection, but with I can. <br /><br />Also I do have a Nintendo Power cart that doesn't have any protected sectors by default and one with two protected sectors(two as seen in hirom). Both behave the same, I can't set/erase the sector protection nor delete/write the hidden area of the first chip. Using bank 0xD0 also doesn't work for me. <br /><br /><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20912715/snes/Snes_Cart_Reader_Mega_Shield/np_writer.zip" class="postlink">Here</a> is my current <a href="http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=158974.msg2579374#msg2579374" class="postlink">Arduino Cart Reader Shield</a> code for the NP cart, it can write the 2MB flashroms in one minute each thanks to using direct port manipulation instead of the Arduino functions I used before. PORTE3 (Arduino Pin 5) is used for generating the clock signal and needs to be connected to the CLK input of the NP cart.<br />Besides the non working sector protection/reading and writing the hidden area on the first flashrom it works quite reliable.<br /><br />Edit: I can erase/set the sector protection by using bank 0xC1 instead of 0xC0. Guess I'll try all banks to see if any work for the hidden mapping area.

I've been exclusively working on the blank cart so maybe that's the difference.  0xD0 works perfectly on the blank cart.  EDIT:  Tested on one of my other carts - Derby 98 and the mapping using 0xD0 works on it as well.<br /><br />@byuu,  you can get carts for less than $20. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  Unfortunately, no one (outside of those in this thread) is dumping the complete menu AND mapping for the NP carts.  Non-menu carts like Wizardry only need the mapping data which is basically 16 bytes in the hidden area.  Creating multi-game carts would probably leave signs in the menu data that they're not original.  Someone would need to accurately reproduce the menu entries including the SJIS, bitmap, and Nintendo/Lawson date and time stamp.  I'm not really interested in faking the carts but at $360 a pop, anyone interested in a <s>Derby 98</s> Wizardry cart? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

So 14 seconds per 2Mbyte means that 4Mbyte will also take only 14 seconds (not 28 seconds).

It now takes only 85s to flash a 4MB file instead of 125s like before thanks to flashing both roms in parallel. <br />With the busycheck commented out it takes 33s but ofc you only get write errors this way, but it means that all the sd reading code and sending the bytes out over the Arduino takes 33s while the additional 52s are spend in the busyloop waiting for the flashrom to send the &quot;finished&quot; command.

I think the formula is okay (for deciphering the bitmaps, which is probably opposite of what you are doing; assuming that you want to create those bitmaps). There is no &quot;1 bit&quot; padding/shifting (mind that hex-digits are 4bit wide).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's a compilation of some stuff I wrote for someone awhile back.<br /><br />There isn't an automated way to make a multi-game ROM yet.  I know one person was planning to write a program to create multi-game ROMs but I haven't heard of any progress for a couple months.  To do it manually, you'll need to gather the games that you want and then create the menu entries starting at 0x62000.  You'll need to know the ROM and RAM sizes and place those into the game entry.  As you add each game, then the offset to the ROM and RAM needs to be calculated.  Once the sizes and offsets are in the game entry, then you need to create the game title for the menu.  Final step would be to create the mapping file which would also include the offsets for each game and the LoROM/HiROM setting.<br /><br />I'd start out with a list of games and write down their characteristics:<br />Game 1: LoROM 512KB ROM, 8KB RAM<br />Game 2: HiROM 512KB ROM<br />Game 3: LoROM 512KB ROM, 2KB RAM<br />and so on.<br /><br />Then write the corresponding bytes into each menu entry.  Game 1 would be at 0x62000, Game 2 would be at 0x64000, Game 3 would be at 0x66000, and each subsequent game +0x2000.  Keep in mind that the Menu uses ROM Block 0 when calculating the ROM offset.<br /><br />===============================<br />If you look at a multi-game cart dump, then the first 0x80000 bytes are the &quot;MENU PROGRAM&quot;.  Within the Menu Program, there are entries used by the menu.  The Menu entry is at address 0x60000.  The Game 1 entry is at address 0x62000.  The Game 2 entry is at address 0x64000.  If there were more games, then they would be at +0x2000 bytes (0x66000, 0x68000, and so on).<br /><br />Each game entry basically has 0x1D8 bytes of unique data within the 0x2000 bytes.  At the end of the block, there is the &quot;MULTICASSETTE 32&quot; text.<br /><br />The full documentation is in nocash's FullSNES here:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://problemkaputt.de/fullsnes.htm#snescartnintendopowerdirectory">http://problemkaputt.de/fullsnes.htm#sn ... rdirectory</a><!-- m --><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Directory Entry Format<br /><br />&nbsp; 0000h 1&nbsp; &nbsp; Directory index (00h..07h for Entry 0..7) (or FFh=Unused Entry)<br />&nbsp; 0001h 1&nbsp; &nbsp; First 512K-FLASH block (00h..07h for block 0..7)<br />&nbsp; 0002h 1&nbsp; &nbsp; First 2K-SRAM block&nbsp; &nbsp; (00h..0Fh for block 0..15)<br />&nbsp; 0003h 2&nbsp; &nbsp; Number of 512K-FLASH blocks (mul 4) (=0004h..001Ch for 1..7 blks)<br />&nbsp; 0005h 2&nbsp; &nbsp; Number of 2K-SRAM blocks (mul 16)&nbsp; &nbsp;(=0000h..0100h for 0..16 blks)<br />&nbsp; 0007h 12&nbsp; &nbsp;Gamecode (eg. &quot;SHVC-MENU-&nbsp; &quot;, &quot;SHVC-AGPJ-&nbsp; &quot;, or &quot;SHVC-CS&nbsp; -&nbsp; &quot;)<br />&nbsp; 0013h 44&nbsp; &nbsp;Title in Shift-JIS format (padded with 00h's) (not used by Menu)<br />&nbsp; 003Fh 384&nbsp; Title Bitmap (192x12 pixels, in 30h*8 bytes, ie. 180h bytes)<br />&nbsp; 01BFh 10&nbsp; &nbsp;Date &quot;MM/DD/YYYY&quot; (or &quot;YYYY/MM/DD&quot; on &quot;NINnnnnn&quot; carts)<br />&nbsp; 01C9h 8&nbsp; &nbsp; Time &quot;HH:MM:SS&quot;<br />&nbsp; 01D1h 8&nbsp; &nbsp; Law&nbsp; &quot;LAWnnnnn&quot; or &quot;NINnnnnn&quot; (eg. &quot;LAW01712&quot;, or &quot;NIN11001&quot;)<br />&nbsp; 01D9h 7703 Unused (1E17h bytes, FFh-filled)<br />&nbsp; 1FF0h 16&nbsp; &nbsp;For File0: &quot;MULTICASSETTE 32&quot; / For Files 1-7: Unused (FFh-filled)</div><br /><br />You'll need to understand bytes 0x0-0x6.  Byte 0 is the Game Entry#.  Byte 1 is the ROM block offset.  Byte 2 is the SRAM block offset.  Bytes 3-4 are the number of ROM blocks used by the game.  Bytes 5-6 are the number of RAM blocks used by the game. The game code at 0x7 can be anything but I'd suggest using the Nintendo assigned game code.  The Shift-JIS text at 0x13 can be anything or padded out.  The title bitmap at 0x3F is the text that is shown in the Menu.  You'll have to convert your game title text to the format that the menu uses.  The time/date/location stamp at 0x1BF can be left the same as you already have.<br /><br />For example, a multi-game cart with 2 games (Shin Megami Tensei 1 &amp; Shin Megami Tensei 2):<br /><br />0x62000:  01 01 00 0C 00 40 00:  Entry 1, ROM Block 1, RAM Block 0, ROM Blocks 0xC, RAM Blocks 0x40<br />0x64000:  02 04 04 10 00 40 00:  Entry 2, ROM Block 4, RAM Block 4, ROM Blocks 0x10, RAM Blocks 0x40<br /><br />If you look at Game 2, the game starts at ROM Block 4 because Game 1 uses 3 (0xC/4) ROM Blocks.  Same goes for the RAM, Game 2 start at RAM Block 4 because Game 1 uses 4 (0x40/16) RAM Blocks.<br /><br />Good Luck!
