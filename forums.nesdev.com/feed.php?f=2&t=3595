Well, someone should have told the people who went and made FCEU non-compatible in the first place.  Still, with enough work and patience, we can probably reimpliment something like that on FCEU ABS.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=156">beneficii</a> — Thu Oct 04, 2007 6:56 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I was pointed to your tools from a posting at romhacking.net and had hoped to use them for a project I recently began working on.

FCEU ABS is descended directly from FCEUXD SP v1.07 and so inherited all its problems.  I did notice that many of the added features (perhaps since FCEUD, perhaps FCEUXD) did not seem to also be implemented on any of the other operating systems (if you look under "drivers," you'll find unique files for each OS).  I recognized the problem, but at the time I did not consider it worth it to do anything about it.<br /><br />As for the problem with the makefiles, the Windows compiles did not make use of anything but makefile.base, makefile.win, and makefile.common (I believe).  Because I resigned myself to compiling in Windows, I did not pay the other makefiles much attention and did not make any modifications to them.  I inherited a pretty messy emulator. ^_^<br /><br />The issue with a lot of the tools that use Windows is that other operating systems most certainly do not use the same API and therefore each of the windows would have to be reprogrammed.  Windows imposes a system that isn't very cross-compatible.<br /><br />Perhaps we should look up the line of precession for this emulator to find out where the cut-offs occurred?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />CDLDIS did compile, but without FCEU ABS, I have no way of using it.

As for restoring the code to portability: I would be willing to provide assistance where I can on it.  It would be an interesting lesson for me, as I don't believe that I am as knowledgeable about makefiles as I should be.

Just so you know, I've made some more updates of the file.  Excepting most of its subroutines, I've finished the NMI and IRQ so far.  I also updated the CDL and DIS files with new code set ("sm2main_" 61dd-61e0 range set to code logged).<br /><br />Thus far, I've finished the main routine, the sound engine, and the victory music (at the end when you rescue the princess) sound engine that is in file "sm2data3".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=156">beneficii</a> — Sat Sep 29, 2007 1:23 am</p><hr />
