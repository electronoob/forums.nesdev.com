		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ran into this working on my compo entry (?).  Basically, the engine inits the characters from a table, moves and animates them and detects overlap with the background.  It works with a few characters on screen, but any more causes the sprites to look corrupted.
<br />
<br />The main loop with 6 characters takes 110 scanlines.  So I don't think it's eating up too much CPU time.  There's no sprite0 or hblank trickery in the screenshots below.
<br />
<br />
<br />With all the sprites drawn on reset and no processing during the NMI, it looks fine:
<br /><img src="http://i53.tinypic.com/111mu02.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />With all the processing done (after 110 scanlines), it looks like this:
<br /><img src="http://i54.tinypic.com/11c6vwn.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />Here's another test:  With just the main character being drawn, moving her to the top edge still causes glitches.
<br />
<br /><img src="http://i55.tinypic.com/2qaqwk7.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i52.tinypic.com/2agrndc.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i54.tinypic.com/2ynsax0.png" alt="Image" />
<br />
<br />So has anyone seen this happen before?  I thought it would be okay as long as there's no more than 8 sprites per scanline.  I'll try burning 512 cycles after the DMA write (Just checked the wiki) but otherwise can't think of anything else.

<br />You don't have to burn anything. When you request a sprite DMA the CPU stays busy for that long while doing the transfer, there's nothing you're supposed to do about that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There are a few weird things in there...
<br />
<br />First, why do you need to disable NMIs? I can only think of that as a waste of CPU time and ROM space. I see that you have the whole game logic in the NMI, is that why?
<br />
<br />Regarding the sprites, it would be a good idea to reset the OAM address before the sprite the DMA, so try writing $00 to $2003.
<br />
<br />Another thing that caught my eye was the read from PPUCTRL. I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish with that, but that register is write-only.
<br />
<br />Another suggestion that probably doesn't have anything to do with the error is moving the controller reading to the end (along with the music), to avoid wasting precious VBlank time with something that doesn't need it.
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if any of that will help you with your problem, but those are the issues I could spot.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It looks like you're not setting the the sprite address, $2003.  Since the main loop seems to be executing from the NMI while disabling/enabling it, it seems likely that the sprite address could somehow be in an unexpected state (depending on the time taken for all execution and branches etc.).  Also would be bad if it's happens to be enabled during a partial vblank (the hardware interrupt is level-sensitive, triggered by state rather than changes).
<br />
<br />And yeah as said, LDA $2000 I guess would be equivalent to doing LDA #$20.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />IIRC, Metroid was another example of a game that executed from NMI.  However, regularly disabling the NMI I believe is a bad idea.  Allowing recursive NMIs would be much safer (because of the partial vblank that I mentioned in my last post, it's likely to happen if you're code takes too long).  In the recursive NMI case you would just handle the vblank-related stuff, then return (based on checking if it has interrupted itself or not).
