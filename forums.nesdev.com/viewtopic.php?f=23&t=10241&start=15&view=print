Doing the math: You don't need a write speed faster than 2.5MB/sec, or 20mbit/sec, or a byte every 400ns.<br /><br />This is 1/20th of USB2.0 &quot;high speed&quot;.

Make Eprom Emulator for the perfect explanation Tepples gave as reason for its existence.<br /><br />6) Work on my incompleted SNES VRAM organizer software for importing graphics and exporting VRAM binary for direct DMA. here is a writeup on it, and github: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bazz1.com/snes-gfx-edit/">http://www.bazz1.com/snes-gfx-edit/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />That has to be determined whether to continue in QT, or I can program in an easier and more intuitive environment. This will involve learning more about graphics file formats such as PNG.<br /><br />7) Work on SNES game<br /><br />There's more to it. Ok I'll keep going<br /><br />8) Minimalize SDL version of the game, ensure raw graphics are directly usable for harmless intuition of use with both SNES and ports. Harmonized to use SVG graphics format with a multi platform SVG-&gt;PNG conversion that is in the works, allows exporting SVG at any scale with no less in quality. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70YGaHByQSQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70YGaHByQSQ</a><!-- m --><br /> This may or may not help with different screen resolutions. Inconclusive, yet seems to be safest approach. However, I do not know how friendly SVG format is with pixel artist types.<br /><br />9) Get in touch more with graphics artists. Tighten up art specifications for enemies and objects. <br />10) Get money<br /><br />11) Continue programming game in SNES and SDL. Stay happy. Have fun.<br />12) We'll get there.

Have fun.<br /></div><br /><br />On a serious note, one thing to consider for target times is the erase time of the memory you're considering.  Large flash chips take ~1min or more to erase.  So in that situation having a 2 second programmer is kind of pointless.  Not that large flash is bad, or 2 seconds isn't valuable time savings.  But I'd consider things like that when considering the speed of the overall design.  If you've settled on slow erasing flash chips, then there isn't much point to jump through a bunch of hoops for sub-10second USB speeds.<br /><br />In regards to flash writing speeds using a chip with buffered writes can drastically reduce programing speeds.  I went from ~12min to ~3min with this switch on one of my projects just due to buffered writes alone.  It's also much more stable and reliable than programing individual bytes.

That might be the simplest thing that could possibly allow testing 1-level builds of your game.

So if you can explain how that input isn't what you're looking for, or what kind of 'factors' your asking about perhaps I can re-direct my answer.<br /><br />Things to consider that might answer your question:<br /><br />*Using a micro-controller to receive data serially in any fashion will be slower than if the mcu can get data in byte chunks from what ever is handling the USB comms.  The less time the mcu has to handle recieving data, the more time it can devote to pumping data into the flash.<br /><br />*Writing to flash is gernally slow, especially old ones.  Current day chips (ones which are still in production) often have means to improve the programming time.  As I pointed out previously buffered writes is one of these tactics.  Another is accelerated voltage for faster programming, this is generally 12v you can apply to a specific pin for faster writes.<br /><br />*Optimizations can make a big difference depending on the application.  If you're developing a game, each build won't likely need the entire chip erased and reprogrammed.  If you do the extra work to sense what bytes/sectors were affected, then you could just transfer the data needed to make those modifications and reflash the needed sectors only.<br /><br />Some other optimizations could be taking advantage of the time the mcu is waiting on the flash chip to finish it's write.  Instead of sitting there and polling the flash for several micro-seconds, the mcu could be making use of that 'down time' to fetch the next chunk of serial data.
