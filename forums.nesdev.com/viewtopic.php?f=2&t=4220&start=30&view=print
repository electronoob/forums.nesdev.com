<br />
<br />I think dvdmth's comment was referring to the fact that the official docs may contain info about various hardware quirks.
<br />
<br />As for posting links to the Saturn docs, the reason I did that was because I was critisizing the quality of the docs that the hardware makers put out, and I wanted to illustrate that by showing some examples (and also because the TS seemed interested in console docs in general).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It was like 10 years ago by now, but I remember Andrew Davie mentioning the official docs on the nesdev email list.  I could be remembering it all wrong, but I believe he said they RE'd the system on their own, then got their Nintendo license + docs later on.  The general idea being that the official docs were vague and close to useless.  Also I'm pretty sure he said he didn't have access to it anymore (it stayed with the old company or something), so I wouldn't bother him about it now.
<br />
<br />I think by now the brightest in the NESdev community know more than anyone at Nintendo ever knew about the system, except maybe the chip designer.  That being said, I would still be really interested in seeing those docs also, if only out of curiosity.
<br />
<br />Also with the way Nintendo was selective and strict about licensing, I wouldn't be surprised if any lack of info in english was intentional.  Hell, they posted their help wanted ad inside the Donkey Kong arcade ROM.  Maybe they figured that reverse-engineers are the best kind of engineers, heh.
<br />
<br />We do however have a seemingly official copy of the Famicom schematic here on the site, contributed by a gentleman who was designing a Famiclone.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, we probably know more than official docs.
<br />
<br />Also, I belive programmers at Rare were british so they probably didn't know a word of japanese, so couldn't read official docs. Maybe that's why they uses so many tricks in their game : They reverse engineered the system instead of just reading the official stuff ?
<br />
<br />And yeah official docs are typically un-technical and incomplete. I'm figuring this out by reading C64 official docs those days. I bet it would be the same with NES official docs.
<br />
<br />Also, I remember that article from a MC-Kids programmer. He says some interesting things, like he could "purchase" options on the cart like a scanline counter or a SRAM+Battery. Maybe the programmer would decide what to "purchase" and then Nintendo decided which MMC it would be ? For example imagine a programmer deciding to purchase a scanline counter, but had a lot of headaches to work with 4kb CHRROM switching but his game ends up with a MMC3 anyway....

<br />Yes, Nintendo--and probably most other companies--outsourced development in many cases. Some companies never actually had their own development team, and instead provided game ideas and resources to third parties. Read up on TOSE Software sometime, you might be shocked to learn how many of your favorite games were actually developed by the same company.
<br />
<br />Hell, even the original Donkey Kong arcade game was developed outside Nintendo! It was developed by Ikegami Tsushinki, who also made Congo Bongo for Sega, which is essentially an isometric version of the same game.

<br />
<br />I don't think official documents for NES would be very helpful at all compared to all the great information you can already get here at NESDEV and from emulator projects. If you want to make an emulator or a game or a hack of a game, all the information you need to do that you can find here. But if you aren't going to put forth the effort with things like learning how to program, no amount of official documents or devkits is going to overcome that.
<br />
<br />So unless you just want a collector's piece I don't see why you'd want them at all.

<br />
<br />I asked Steven Kent ("Ultimate History of Video Games") if he'd heard of this and he said no! 
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sadsamspalace.blogspot.com/2008/03/are-new-games-better-than-old-ones.html">http://sadsamspalace.blogspot.com/2008/ ... -ones.html</a><!-- m --> (in the comments at the end)
<br />
<br />I noticed that Ikegami DOES have a Wikipedia entry of their own which makes claim to it, so I added a section to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Donkey_Kong_%28video_game%29#Ikegami_Tsushinki" class="postlink">Discussion</a>page of the Donkey Kong entry. It's particularly interesting that they sued Nintendo and that it took 7 or 8 years before they settled out of court. 
<br />
<br />Also regarding the manual, I asked someone who worked on an old American game and he said that distributing such stuff would land us both in court and that these are Nintendo's "family jewels" so to speak! I was really disappointed then, but then I realized he must be right. No great game has so far been made by amateurs using the reverse-engineered information on the web! There must be some fantastic secrets available in the official documentation, and that's why everyone is so reticent to reveal it! 
<br />
<br />For instance, what if some of the early Mario code examples matches Donkey Kong's... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />I'm kidding. But, as I said, I think having all the information you can get your hands on regarding the NES machine, if you want to learn about it and all, would be good. I don't understand wanting to have LESS information, even if it's duplicative or only confirmative of what's already there. I searched the history of Nes Dev Boards 1 &amp; 2 and I seem to be the only person who's ever asked about a development manual? Oh well. If I ever do make a game I'll try to do it on my own -- scratching that project I suggested, which tepples expressed interest in -- and I'll write a how-to guide explaining how to make it, to help beginners. 
<br />
<br />Thanks for the responses guys!

<br />
<br />The reason no "great games" have been made from the public documents available is because no one here is a paid professional working for a company like Konami or Capcom being told it's their job to make a new NES game. You don't seem to understand that we have more information now than alot of NES developers ever had. I also think you are confusing making a game on the NES with making a game in general. 
<br />
<br />If you're going to make a game on the NES, the first thing you need to know is how to PROGRAM. And then how to program a GAME. Once you understand those, then you need to learn how to program a game for the NES specifically. Many people here have asked about "how do I get started" and people here will tell them the same basic things that we all know. You need to learn 6502 assembly programming. You need to read technical documents about the NES. You may want to look through the disassembly of a professional NES game too. 
<br />
<br />I just find it so strange that you think there is some some of <strong>trick</strong> or <strong>secret</strong> to making a NES game. There isn't. It's just good old fashioned hard work. And that should be obvious because if it were easy, you wouldn't be here now talking about how no one has made a new great NES game. 
<br />
<br />And to be clear, we all would like to see new great NES games here. This is afterall a community all about the NES.
