For example, not all anime use the tall, skinny, angular style associated with bishie series. Some are rounder; trope wonks call this <a href="https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Puni_Plush" class="postlink">Puni Plush</a>.<br /><br />To shut up people who nitpick proportions, draw chibi characters. These tend to run 2-3 heads tall for children and 3-4 for adults.<br /><br /><a href="https://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=File:PM_family_colored.png" class="postlink"><img src="https://pineight.com/mw/images/thumb/2/24/PM_family_colored.png/320px-PM_family_colored.png" alt="Image" /><br />I can barely draw</a><br /><br />But in anime, <a href="https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Four-Fingered_Hands" class="postlink">leaving off the pinky</a> is forbidden for two reasons: <a href="https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Four_Is_Death" class="postlink">four is death</a> and a <a href="https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Yubitsume" class="postlink">Yakuza tradition</a>.<br /><br /><br />So anyway, is there a chance that both porno and non-porno versions of a game can be released, just as <a href="https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Pirates_XXX" class="postlink"><em>Pirates 30</em> (2005)</a> got an R-rated cut?
