Programming is not as tedois as doing graphics IMO. And I'm supposed to be part of a team, but I admit I do 95% of the work currently. Altough I'm very happy when my friend gives me ideas, I don't always have good ideas for game (altough I can come with programming skills and do some music), but he always have incredibly fun and original ideas I would never have. Because he knowns absolutely nothing about computers this is even more funny how he can make up stuff. If I don't want to do it because the idea is just too crazy I just say it's technically impossible, and he's forced to belive me because he knowns nothing technical.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Mar 28, 2009 2:09 pm</p><hr />

Not to mention also people had a staff dedicated to a project. And each person worked on a specific part, knowing exactly what they had to do. We have to come up with all the concepts behind a game, program it, <em>and</em> create all the data ourselves. Coming up with the concepts behind a game (for example, how maps are to be stored, how AI works, the math behind game logic, etc.) might prove to be the hardest part. Once you know what to program, it's not as hard. Though programming is usually tedious.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Sat Mar 28, 2009 12:13 pm</p><hr />

Oh you are right about the lack of time, partially right at least.<br />A professional would do that 40 hours per week, but I'm glad if I do 2 or 3 in average, so we would take about 20 times more time to complete the project than a professional.<br /><br />But also each time you wonder which of the many possible way you'll handle something instead of just handling it the first way that comes to mind is lost.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Mar 28, 2009 10:26 am</p><hr />

My goal is to have fun making a nes game first and I'm more than happy with that.  If I can optimize it latter to fit in a smaller space then I will be even happier.

<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Know why so many of us can't release a really great NES game ?<br /></div><br />Lack of time, probably. I always see people saying how great NES programmers back at the time were, but there was nothing special about them. In fact, today we have more knowledge and better tools to make games better than they could. The big difference is that they were paid to do it, and invariably dedicated quite a few hours of each day to their projects. I have to squeeze a couple of hours at the end of the day whenever I can to work on my project, and that's why it's so hard to finish it.<br /><br />IMO, the difference in complexity between NROM games and mapped games (that are similar in gameplay) is negligible. You'll just spend more time generating data for the project with more CHR and PRG, but getting the basic engine working shouldn't take longer. It's simply not true that games running on simpler mappers are easier to make. It can in fact be the opposite, such as in cases where more ROM and RAM would allow you to store data in a more friendly way for your code, and without it you have to use tricks to achieve the same goal (do more with less).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sat Mar 28, 2009 6:50 am</p><hr />

Okay everyone seems on a NROM vs MMC5 debate here.<br />Personally most of my favourite NES games (Castlevania, Mega Man 1-2, Contra, Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy, Battletoads) uses mapper 1, 2 or 7, which uses some mapper, but not some extremely powerful mapper and managed to be absolutely awesome IMO.<br /><br />Sure I love Castlevania 3 and Just Breed which uses MMC5, and I like many games (SMB3 and Mega Man 3-6) using MMC3 pretty much, but they are <em>sequels</em> to games with simpler mappers.<br /><br />But if I were to nominate a "super mapper" to be available, I'd definitely vote for a MMC5 clone. It has everything, all bankswitching modes thinkable, graphics extansions, large amounts of SRAM and a fast multiplier. Everyone seems to think about the MMC3 but I think it's over-rater, altough it can allow smaller CHR bankswitching than the MMC1, and have a crappy scanline counter, it's about all it can do better than it. If you use CHR-RAM you don't want to worry about the former, and the scanline counter is really limiting, but it's true that in some case it would still be better than sprite zero hits if you are having more than one split point on your screen during gameplay. Also it lacks MMC1's 32kb PRG bankswitching and one-screen mirroring, which could be essential.<br /><br />Anyway it is pretty clear that the mapper have a strong influence on :<br />- Amount of different graphics<br />- Amount of levels and music present in the game<br />- Whether or not you can save your game<br />- The presence of on-boad SRAM can increase possibilities of the game engine<br /><br />The following elements are not affected by the mapper :<br />- How detailed the graphics are drawn<br />- How good your levels are<br />- How good the music is<br />- How fun it is to play the game<br /><br />Hironically, today the most advanced homebrew NES game ever made is NESnake 2 by Matrixz which uses NROM !! It has very great music, very good gameplay and is very fun. It does also have quite good graphics for a snaks game. It looks better than SMB in fact, but it doesn't make any sense to compare a snake game and a platformaer.<br /><br />Know why so many of us can't release a really great NES game ? We really are thinking too hard instead of just throwing creative ideas straight in a programm ! Everyone on this thread is thinking way too hard. I want's until I came here, but now I'm thinking too hard instead of acting.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sat Mar 28, 2009 2:32 am</p><hr />

No mapper will do your physics for you, or the scrolling engine, or anything else. Sure, having extra RAM or ROM might have an impact on how you design the code, but the logic will be basically the same with or without a mapper. Mappers simply allow you to polish things up a bit, something that shouldn't be frowned upon. The NES is still doing all the work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Fri Mar 27, 2009 8:23 am</p><hr />

The most impressive CNROM games are Dragon Quest 1, and Egypt.  That's about as close to NROM as you can get without being NROM.  (Don't bother mentioning those games that are NROM with "bankswitching" for copy protection)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=53">Dwedit</a> — Thu Mar 26, 2009 7:45 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">6502freak wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Tell that an Atari 2600 homebrewer, who has even fewer resources to work with, yet still manages to put a fun game together.<br /></div><br /><br />There's a game as enjoyable/fun/good looking as say, Battletoads on Atari 2600?<br /><br />I personally find the Atari to be so limited that games really aren't that fun on it. Pitfall! is a miracle (basically the equivalent to, if not superior than SMB1's condensation) but I don't enjoy it as much as I could. Honestly, if they had another 4k to work with that would be great.<br /><br />And I don't agree with the argument that SMB1 is a special case and we can't replicate that. True, it's an extraordinary display of compression, but your muscles are capable of moving in a manner that would type that same code, so you <em>can</em> do something similar in terms of compression. But it's true, this is basically the only NROM game that did anything that impressive, and there comes a point where you can't do anything else.<br /><br />I like to think, what would someone who has a NES really like to see? Someone who doesn't have an SNES or anything else; what would they like to see? Well, I know they don't want to see anything boring like Lunar Pool or the other NROM games; not even another SMB1. They want to see something with good graphics, sound, and gameplay. Something that's not so limited/repetitive. I can take this MMC3 board which allows for more PRG space and a scanline counter; that, I could really work with. The only thing is that it -has- to be for the NES. The rest is up to me.<br /><br />Most of us do NESDev to see what the <em>NES</em> can do. That's the one thing that we don't expand on/change. We all love our NES, and we don't want to move away from the system itself. That's why we come up with all these things to improve the quality of games we make on the NES. And it's a fact: certain things cannot be done with NROM that can be done with other mappers. A powerful mapper <em>does</em> improve the <em>possibilities</em> in terms of overall quality for a NES game. It does not improve the quality by itself.<br /><br />I do find this argument rather thought-provoking. It does make sense to ask: why develop with super mappers when you can just develop for a more powerful system? Doesn't that take the fun/point away? But the answer is: because we love the NES.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Thu Mar 26, 2009 6:46 pm</p><hr />

I don't care about Atari 2600 homebrew. The system is garbage. I don't consider any 2600 game to be "fun". Why don't you go hang out at a 2600 forum instead.<br /><br />I'm not developing on the NES right now. But if I were it would be for the fun of making a NES game. You know, enjoyment. I'm not going to "prove your point" by saying whatever crap makes you feel smart. You're acting like a huge ass. And believe it or not no one here including me has to prove anything to you. Infact if you know better than all of us why don't you go start your own forum.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Thu Mar 26, 2009 6:21 pm</p><hr />
