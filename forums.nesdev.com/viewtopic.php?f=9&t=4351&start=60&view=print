<br />The PowerPAK FDS already supports saving to disk. To save, after saving in game you need to hold RESET for 4 seconds or so and it'll ask you which disk file you need to write back to.

<br />do you have to create a .SAV file first just like with regular NES games?

<br />Just a bunch of NSF's.  You don't need to convert.

<br />
<br />As far as saving for FDS games, for instance, Castlevania, as a test, I played through level one, and died till it gave me the option to save and chose to save. Then it kept on resetting, telling me to change the disk side (it did this automatically). I held down the reset for 4 seconds (tried it for longer as well), but there was no option to save the game to the FDS file.
<br />
<br />Incidentally, anyone get the FDS version of Metroid to work? I loaded it up and just freezes when you first start from the beggining of the game

<br />What's the name of the dump you are using? Also as I stated, I tried to save in Castlevania, as well as Kid Icarus, and after I saved and held Reset on the system for about 4 seconds, it didn't give me the option to save the game to the FDS file (just went to the PowerPak start up screen).

<br />Are you sure you are using the most recent FDS driver file and have a patched FDS bios? Other than those I don't know what to tell you other than it will ask you to save the FDS if the game trys to write to it and you hold down reset to return to the main menu of teh powerpak. It might not ask you first thing but maybe it's after you push A once or something.

<br />I had the same freezing problem, until I changed some memory timing (as mentioned <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?p=40311#40311" class="postlink">here</a>).  Maybe with some adjustments I can get it working for you.

<br />Yea so am I. For those interested, I performed the extra sound mod with a 47k ohm resistor and it works great - Castelvania III (J), Doki Doki Panic, and others really take advantage of it

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The above mentioned dump of the FDS version of Metroid doesn't (playably) work for me, using the latest FDS mapper (the one with FDS sound). It gets all the way to the name entry screen, but when you try to start a game it says "omachi kudasai" in hiragana (light blue text), followed by a grey screen with white text saying something about BCRS ("BCRS yuyotsu" (yuyo is lowercase katakana, is it garbage?) or something) and some katakana ("set B side" or something), then the BCRS/katakana text glitches/turns light blue(black background) for a second before jumping to a black screen. Resetting at this point gives a glitched FDS BIOS followed by a glitched "Family Computer" screen (halfway down the screen, doesn't scroll up) (glitched BIOS screen remains visible), but the game seems to start as before after that.
<br />
<br />(with some dumps of Metroid I can get all the way to the first screen with some finagling, but the level is horribly glitched and Samus and the enemies can't move)
<br />
<br />As a side note, I've noticed Puzzle Boys freezes during saving whenever I try to save, has anyone else had that problem? (happened once to me...and boy is it a long way to that first save point to try again, unless there's something I don't know... I didn't try just saving to the FDS file anyway to see if it worked...)
<br />
<br />EDIT: Tried it this morning, no BCRS screen, just a frozen black screen... one time the BCRS screen appeared with a black background... and now it's behaving as above again...weird.
