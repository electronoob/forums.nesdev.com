		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been toying with the idea of making my own monitor driver to output to a CGA monitor, I have not dealt with video too much so I would like to ask some input and see how far off my calculations are. 
<br />
<br />Bandwidth: ~ 5.8MHz
<br />HSync: ~ 15.75KHz
<br />projected resolution: 320x200
<br />
<br />based on the 5.8MHz bandwidth, the 1.575KHz H sync rate, and the 60Hz V sync rate....  this should leave me around 368 clock cycles to draw and retrace per scanline at around 262 times per frame.... correct?
<br />
<br />I am thinking that I will start drawing my image on the 20th scanline, and at the 20th clock cycle of each scanline for the following 200 scanlines... leaving 28 clock cycles for overscan and h retrace.... and 42 scan lines for overscan and vertical retrace. 
<br />
<br />Does this all seem like a good starting point to start tweaking various settings to generate the image?

<br />
<br />I never read much DOS Documents, but If i'm not wrong, the CGA can also go up to 640x480 maximum, and custom fonts was only in Higher end Hercules cards as well as EGA or compatible, But CGA only has a default font, so it can't do fonts (unless in graphics modes?)
<br />
<br />so if I was to select a old Video card back then, EGA/VGA or anything compatible was the better choice, if you also want font support, Stick with that
<br />
<br />Also, a Reference: NO$GMB can emulate the gameboy (sloooowly) in CGA in pure DOS only, so any Windows version does not work well with it, Dosbox or equivlents do work though!
<br />
<br />EDIT: The ugly colors in CGA were the only dislike in my opinion,
<br />
<br />qbradq: I also do not know, But it's may depend on the computer that monitor is using, For example: Apple2 vs Amiga monitors use different plugs, So it may depend on the video processor (GPU) and how much pins the monitor plug uses!

<br />Also CGA monitors have enough overscan you should be able to increase the onscreen pixel count to 90x30=720x240 (per <a href="http://www.oldskool.org/pc/cgacomp" class="postlink">Trixter's authentic CGA tester</a>)
<br />
<br />Or if you're comfortable with Xorg modelines,
<br /> "640x200" 14.32 640 752 816 912  200 225 228 261 # H-15700Hz V-60.15Hz
<br />
<br />The analog bandwidth of the CGA monitor is at LEAST ~15MHz. Many also accept interlaced input, for which you should use native NTSC 480i timing.

<br />I got a sudden interest in the project, So can you do a source code release with a license via GNU v3 or something?
<br />
<br />I was working on something like it for Epic (Mega)Games ZZT/SuperZZT as a EGA/VGA project, with some help of DigitalMZX and Z2, But could not use the pseudo-code because of QB45 not supporting STORE or LOAD functions,

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />hehe, I have plans to release what I am working on... the video portion and more. I am going to do a few tests with hardware only to drive the video.. to get any timing issues and what not worked out and then re-implement it using a micro-processor.
<br />
<br />In case anyone is curious, the whole project is a 6502 based computer that I plan on building out of misc parts i have had sitting around my house for a while. 
<br />
<br />
<br />I plan on having the memory mapped divided as follows: (sorry for the caps)

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />The 8KB Register/Expansion area will be further divided in to 8 1Kb sections for expansion slots. slot 0 from 0x8000 - 0x83FF will be for internal register and hardware control for video, input, etc. 
<br />
<br />I figure the system will start running the internal ROM at powerup or reset, and let the use jump to the cartridge rom (if one is inserted) or allow the user to run some sort of monitor program... and use the interrupt to control system functions
<br />
<br />I am not to sure what I would like to do as far as sound, anyone have any suggestions?

<br />
<br />using these enhancements are really promising a bit, so this is a long way to go before making the final product!

<br />
<br /> Are you going to be doing the sound via an MCU or real low level parts (or cpld or such)?
<br />
<br /> If you have the resource to spare, a PHA (phase accumulator) square and saw-tooth (ramp) generator is always fun. As long as you have enough timing 'resolution' to drive the PHA, else it'll sound dirty IMO. If you do saw-tooth/ramp, go one step further and add hard sync. It's dead simple and sounds good with a saw waveform.
