<br />
<br />Secularized Christmas derives from ancient holidays called Saturnalia and Yule, on the conjecture that Jesus of Nazareth died on the anniversary of conception.

<br />
<br />That may be true... And as much as I usually dislike the Christmas season and its rampant consumerism... 
<br />
<br />I received my NES at Christmas in 1987.  I was quite surprised.  Winters in south Texas were usually cold and wet, with little snow.  That year we had snow for Christmas too.
<br />
<br />My parents were adamant that video game made people stupid and that the world had no use for them.  My dad actually called my Atari 2600 and NES "the idiot box".
<br />
<br />The NES came with <em>Super Mario Brothers</em>.  My parents also gave us <em>The Legand of Zelda</em> and <em>Kung Fu</em>.  Our first purchased game a few weeks later was <em>Wrecking Crew</em>.  I don't remember the game order after that.  LOZ was the first game that I "beat" (first quest).
<br />
<br />This year my wife and mother-in-law had a "failure to communicate" and they BOTH gave me the collector's edition of the <em>Metroid Trilogy</em> for our Wii.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I'll play one and keep the other MIB.  Two years ago I gave to my mother-in-law 4 NES games for her collection (she has almost 300 unique titles): <em>Fire 'n Ice</em>, <em>Bubble Bobble</em>, <em>Rainbow Island</em> and <em>A Boy and His Blob</em>.  My mother-in-law is awesome.  We often play <em>Tetris Attack</em> on her SNES (both gifts from my wife and I) when we visit.
<br />
<br />My mother-in-law also gave me five wrapped gifts: All various bags of Reese's Pieces candies, including a 6-pack bag of huge peanut butter cups.  Now I must defend my prize against my wife and her sister. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />You shouldn't mix everything. Chrismas, as it is the celebration of Jesus' birth, I love it. "Christmas" that the commercials use for rampant consumerism, I really hate it - but it's not really Christmas anyway.

<br />
<br />Hah join the club.  I wasn't allowed to have NES or 2600.  "Brain rot" was my dad's phrase.  I had plenty of friends with them tho.  Finally got my own NES for Christmas last year from my wife...it was my in-law's NES.
