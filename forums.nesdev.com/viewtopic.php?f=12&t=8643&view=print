It appears to do the same thing.

<br />
<br />
<br />Well it is 1/2 the price of the basic SD2SNES and roughly 2/3 the price of the PowerPak and you get a copier, a retrode is the same price, is it really that expensive.

It's just a shame that if it were just a bit cheaper I think it would be an even better deal. Also the 32M limit is kind of a downer I guess for the few games that could use more. But I guess overall, it isn't bad. Fairly good deal atleast from the look of things.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It looks pretty cool.  It is a miniaturized copier.  Instead of a floppy it uses SD, and instead of a parallel port it uses a USB port.  Looking at the manual, it definitely seems to be a re-hash of a copier:

<br />
<br />I wish it had the FPGA of the sd2snes because the sd2snes will be the best cart for game compatibility, but the sd2snes will lack two features that this Super UFO cart will have: backup existing carts and USB-to-PC link.
<br />
<br />I'll probably pick this up, and I will definitely get an sd2snes.  I mean, I am still playing the same console for the past 20 years... why wimp out now.

<br />
<br />Im curious, since this copier will allow to use special chips if you have the correct carts, is it possible to make a snes cart containing all the special chips and a dip switch of some sort so you can choose chip? I know I would need to desolder and destroy some cart's, but that would be great.
<br />If anyone is up for it I could at least order some boards, but I guess that's not somthing people wan't to do considering the sd2snes is on it's way.

<br />
<br />This is a mistake or translation error. You CAN'T play special chip games as ROMS on this device. It merely tells you that you can play these games through the device. The way the chips like Super FX are designed it is impossible to do what can be done with DSP1 where you just plug in a cartridge on some copiers. This never will change, ever. If you want to play these games buy them or hope SD2SNES will support them.

<br />
<br />Tip: Me and a friend have already bought the Super Ufo Pro 8 from Tototek. They seem to have the best price, and cheapest shipping. They even include one of their CIC adapters. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Wonder if the DSP1 games works with a cart on top. Though, getting rid of floppies and my old huge copier is the main reason I bought it. I just like to be able to do everything with my old game consoles <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
