		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So the logo is in the MBC. I've erased my flash and the Gameboy still boots with the correct logo. Also found out that a read to address 0150 deactivates the MBC's internal ROM. Sanqui's 2048 would not boot on my MX cart due to no jump to 0150 at startup. Sanqui added a jump to 0150 and now the ROM plays fine.<br /><br />CLK is not connected so the MBC is more than likely watching the bus for a certain address read. Cant seem to replicate it with my cart reader though. Might try step through the gameboy's boot rom via my cart reader to see what activates the initial ROM swap.<br /><br />I have also cut down my MX cart to fit inside a standard gamecart, however now i cant get the original MX ROM to boot. I'll double check my address lines have not detached from the sawing of the board. Odd because MegaMan2 (256kybte) runs fine in its entirety. My replacements should arrive after the easter break so i'll continue investigating then.<br /><br />AND!<br /><br />I now have 10 spare Gamecart Reader/Writers available if anyone is interested. Get yourself one, and a Shark MX and you have your self a cheap Development Kit! Custom flash carts are in the works.

Maybe the same thing.[/quote]<br /><br />Just tried a read of a blank cart, before and after a read from 0x0133. Still reading 0xFF's. Even after a few consecutive cart dumps, still 0xFF's. So its looking for a particular sequence of events. OR perhaps a defined delay between one read and another (The MBC does have a xtal strapped to the side of it) Which i just noticed has lost a leg!<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />Replaced the 4mhz xtal with a 4.9152 xtal borrowed from the si2400 IC. And this is the result!<br /><br /><img src="http://www.bennvenn.com/GBAMAIL_Nintendo.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Half Flash Logo header, and half the MBC's Nintendo header... Must have in internal counter activated at the first bus RD, swapping in the Legit ROM at a number of cycles. Cool

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Random thoughts that come to mind:<br />Have you tried dumping the MBC1's internal boot ROM? Is there anything interesting in it? (Or just the Nintendo logo?)<br />Do writes to any address below 0x3F00 do anything?<br />Given that the logo is half-and-half, it's gotta be timed from something earlier than the first fetch from 0x104, because 4MHz vs 5MHz isn't big enough. But to calculate how far back the timing should be, I'd have to understand how the logo is compressed...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Haven't tried dumping the internal ROM. I'd need to write some code on my reader to find out the timing specifics. I'd say its just the Logo stored on it though. What is interesting is that when booted on my GB pocket, even less of the GBMail logo is displayed. Looks like maybe 4 or 5 tiles from top left running right. This must mean the pocket runs a different boot rom. Must take up more clock cycles before it gets around to interrogating the cart.<br /><br />Any writes below 0x3F00 are passed directly through the MBC to the Flash. Not to say that it isn't modifying any internal registers, but there is no sign of any output from the MBC.<br /><br />is a read from 0x0104 the first time the cart bus is accessed? <br /><br />I wonder if I force a reset via the RST line while the cart is on, if i'll get the same messed up logo or purely a Nintendo Logo.

Everything before that in the DMG bootstrap is clearing VRAM and sound registers. (0x0104 is the first byte of the copyright-used-as-licensing logo.) I can't trivially find anyone else's analysis of the later bootstraps, though, to compare.<br /><br />Kinda fun to build your own replacement logo, although how much of it shows depends on which exact GB you're using.

Correct me if I'm wrong (haven't investigated) but this should be apparent on the Cart Bus? Or at least the /WR activity? looks like a good point to start an internal timer.<br /><br />The original MX cart with the 4mhz Xtal booted fine on GB, GB pocket and GBC.

But I don't know what the protection register does: it could be as simple as just disabling the /RD strobe as seen by the cartridge... but it has to disable the data bus also, otherwise we wouldn't have needed to glitch it to get the bootstrap ROM out.

By early 1993, such circumventions of the <a href="http://segaretro.org/TradeMark_Security_System" class="postlink">trademark security system</a> were no longer strictly necessary in the USA. Besides, the &quot;Nintendo&quot; logo is shown on the box. This would leave the reasonable user to believe that the logo identifies the maker of the <em>hardware</em>. It took until the 2004 release of the Nintendo DS for Nintendo to come up with something with slightly more legal teeth.
