		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, I am having troubles with the PPU part, after reading alot of nes docs, and various other source code of other emulators, I decided to go for a per pixel rendering, I based the PPU on nintendulator, with some modifications, and all I am getting is garbage when testing very simple games such as ExciteBike or some tutors. I checked the CPU and the memory write functions, as well as the PPU many times, and I couldn't figure out what is wrong. To the best of my knowledge, the PPU should work, well the background part, since I didn't do sprites yet. Can anyone please do a code review for me and see what is wrong? I would think the main trouble is just something I did with the PPU. If you would like to compile it, just a C compiler, gmake, and SDL with opengl is all that is needed, the source code is at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://spark.ofloo.net/~qeed/nes.tar.gz">http://spark.ofloo.net/~qeed/nes.tar.gz</a><!-- m --> and the tutor rom i am trying to get working is
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://spark.ofloo.net/~qeed/tutor.nes">http://spark.ofloo.net/~qeed/tutor.nes</a><!-- m -->. Right now the emulator just displays a black screen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Divide and conquer is the only way to debug something like this. Start with something very basic that works, like filling the palette with some non-black color and verifying that the screen is not black. Then try enabling the background, setting a palette of various colors and some random patterns, and verify that you get a pattern on screen. Your CPU could also be the cause, and it should be debugged separately.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the tips, I am currently trying to fix the CPU based on some dumps from various emulators. I have ran into one problem though, 
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://nesdevwiki.org/index.php/Power-Up_State">http://nesdevwiki.org/index.php/Power-Up_State</a><!-- m -->, here it states that all memory from 0 - 0x7ff was consistently set to 0xFF except for a few. Though I ran into some problems with this trying out mario_bros_u.nes version, where it did ldx $70 without storing any value into it first. I think it was supposed to be 0. I tested this on FCEU, and it seems fceu sets 0 on every 4 value, and then 0xFF on every 4 values after and so on. I was wondering which is right?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some game dumps are hacked, in particular to rely on a particular hardware copier/player/menu that clears RAM before running the game, and many SMB dumps are like this. As for correct, each NES probably has a slightly different power-up state of RAM, depending on the individual chip and also on manufacturer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />i think starting with pixel method is the best way to keep it simple ( KISS ) and learn it,  like blargg said, divide and conquer.
<br />
<br />first is to get the cpu working perfectly.  that would be a waste of time to hunt down a bug that you thought was in the ppu but really in the cpu.   get nestest.nes to work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />it can be done without.  there is a post where blargg or quietust posted a cpu log of nestest.  i mosty used that and compared with my cpu log.  i dont think its around anymore, perhaps that should be added to the wiki or main page.  i find that to be more useful.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />thanks, I managed to fix some CPU bugs today, one was where I didnt add one to the JSR address when pushing on to the stack and the other was I didnt set the S and Z flag with the TSX instruction. After fixing these 2, I verified the output of the memory dumps from well known emulators, they seemed to match. I am pretty certain it is the way I handle the PPU addresses. Do you guys have any emulators to recommend that can show you reg2006 during rendering and how it updates? I think I am getting closer, some games actually display something now, albeit its just garbage on the screen <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />*update* 
<br />I have finally gotten the background rendering to work, though I have some questions about the sprites. Do the sprites X value be affected by fine x? If fine x is a different value, will that offset the sprite too? I am also having trouble understanding the delayed by sprites are delayed by one scanline. Does that mean you build the buffer for the next scanline from the previous scanline for rendering when you go to the next scanline and so on?
