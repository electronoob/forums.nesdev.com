It won't be a compatible pinout with the existing DE9-joystick game consoles (none support 8 digital outputs).<br /><br />The Neo Geo <a href="https://www.gamesx.com/controldata/superneo.htm" class="postlink">DA15 port</a> could be worth mimicking instead.

(Apparently, it's just a standard computer cable like the Genesis.) All of this put together is pretty expensive, but it's still cheaper than a Jamma control stick and probably more comfortable. Plus, if I do want to switch to a control stick, there is also the one available for the Neo Geo, although it's more expensive than the already expensive gamepad.<br /><br />Edit: A new post was made while I was writing this:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The Neo Geo DA15 port could be worth mimicking instead.</div><br />It appears I wasn't quite as clever as I thought. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />Yeah, I'm going to go with a Neo Geo controller. Even if it's more expensive, I don't really feel like destroying a Genesis controller.

SwOyJX6pvu</a><!-- m --> The only thing that sucks is the lack of component or even composite output. However, I know of a couple VGA to composite (not component, sadly) adapters, but they all have a 5V DC plug. The supergun wants an ATX power supply though, so it's not like an arcade power supply to where I could just screw this onto the front of it along with the Jamma wiring harness, so I have no idea how I'm going to power it. I could use the included 5V DC to USB and a USB wall adapter, but then my arcade machine setup would be taking up two wall outlets and just look even more ghetto.<br /><br />There's actually a 3/6 button Sega Genesis to Neo Geo controller port by the same seller (I presume it uses the unused pins for extra buttons), so I don't have to spend $100 on two Neo Geo CD controllers, thank God. There's even one for the SNES and the PS1/PS2, but I don't like how they mapped the buttons (luckily they show you how it's mapped in a picture).

A bit (or rather, byte <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />) overkill, but since the CPS1 had 12bit RGB, it was probably easiest to just double it. (Definately the biggest improvement; I much prefer the sound of CPS1 games, those without added Q sound of course.) 8bit alpha transparency is a load of BS though; it's pretty clear that person has no clue what they're talking about. I don't know why people keep bringing up the Neo Geo's increased memory range for graphics when even it used bank switching by the end of its life. The biggest sin of all from that thread though, is the guy calling the SNES SFA2 port impressive for the hardware. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />From what I've been reading now, I think we're both wrong. A good number of sources seem to claim that it uses 12bit RGB, but with 4 bits of luminescence, which seems pretty odd, but you've got to figure that it probably would have been more work to get 15bit RGB and 1 bit of luminescence like the Neo Geo. This lines up from what I've seen; things like the background of Ryu's stage in Street Fighter Alpha 2 would show more obvious banding if it were 12 bit color, and taking a screenshot and analysing the color values, they don't match 15bit RGB being rounded to 24bit RGB for the display, like the M92 or other arcade machines I know that use 15bit RGB.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A Neo Geo controller connector is definitely the standard for a supergun, and all the ones I own have them. If you're gonna build your own you might as well go with that. It's a very easy plug to get ahold of, it's able to map more buttons than the MegaDrive one, and also uses direct switches with no signal modulation.<br /><br />Don't convert arcade video signal to composite. If you want to use it on a standard American TV, get a component encoder (I got one for around $50), and don't build it into your supergun. Just hook it up externally, so you can get decent video quality from all your other consoles, too.<br />The base supergun (a power supply + wiring from a JAMMA connector to the PSU and plugs for controls and a SCART video output) is actually really cheap, but it takes some work to make them. You probably want adjustable resistors (potmeters) on both the Red, Green, and Blue video signals, since these can easily vary between games.<br /><br />As for the chips, most arcade games will have some special chips that makes the games difficulty to bootleg (and often you'd even see them scratching out the manufacturer and model logos), but in all of the 60-70 arcade PCBs that I own, I have NEVER seen one that doesn't use standard sizes ROM chips, making them very easy to replace.<br />Typically program ROMs are even socketed EPROMs, making them very homebrew/hack friendly, since the developers would usually need to make changes close to release, or even afterwards if exploits were found in the arcades. Sound and graphics data tend to be mask ROMs, but it really depends on the game. I even got my EspGaluda with an extra hacked rom that allows saving the high score data.

In addition, it's almost impossible to get game boards by themselves for some reason, unless the ratio of system pcbs to game pcbs is roughly 1:1.</div><br /><br />The $500 price point and above is usually reserved for rare'ish shooters, most arcade games shouldn't set you back that much. What games are you looking for in particular? Personally I found most of my games for less than $100, or even $50, but the prices in general have gone up a bit the last few years. Some of my games cost a fortune, but those are specifically selected titles that I cherish more than any other games I own.<br /><br />Regarding the system pcb to game pcb ratio:<br />The only arcade system that was ever really succesful with separately sold catridges was the Neo Geo. To a smaller extend ST-V and PlayChoice (both based on console hardware) and the PGM (a Neo Geo clone). Even the CPS2 and the Taito F3 system, which are the only other &quot;major&quot; cartridge based arcade systems I can think of, are usually sold along with the motherboard, since that's how they were distributed to arcades, to be plugged into generic JAMMA cabinets. SNK were the only ones who really got away with expecting arcades to have (one or more) existing Neo Geo cabinets they could just plug loose carts into.<br /><br />Other systems which have both motherboards and daughter (game) boards don't work well with switching out games. Examples are the Konami GX variants and CPS1. Even separating the games from their motherboards can be difficult (compared to cartridges), and only certain motherboards will work with certain games. I've never seen anyone switching out these games, and I wouldn't recommend trying it. If you're looking for CPS1 games, don't buy loose daughter- or motherboards.<br /><br />Furthermore, some CPS1 games did indeed have the suicide thing. It's easier to hack/fix than CPS2, but most likely you'd end up with one that needs fresh batteries, and won't work if you start switching out the ROMs. The ones that have it are usually the later ones, like Three Wonders, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs and King of Dragons. Fortunately the CPS1 games that I own (Varth, Pang 3, and Ghouls n Ghosts/Daimakaimura), don't have it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />TGM3 is a strange one, since it relies on Type X hardware, similarly to most other newer arcade games, such as Street Fighter IV.<br />The game itself is not a PCB, it's just a hard drive and a USB dongle or something like that. I never really got into the Type X series of &quot;arcade hardware&quot;, since it is literally just a Windows PC with a specific hardware configuration. I'm not really interested in that stuff.<br /><br />I don't know when you were on TC, but I bought my TGM2 PCB around three years ago (just before the game attracted new attention via AGDQ), and the price point has grown to nearly three times what I paid since then (and I paid a lot, too). It's definitely one of the most expensive bare arcade PCBs out there.

Not many games use the M72, but they all use boards that System16 calls &quot;similar base hardware to M72, but all with slight differences&quot;, whatever that means; it's the exact same V30, Z80, and YM2151, all at the same clockspeed. The video hardware looks the same, with all the games I've inspected having the same 384x256 resolution, 15bit color, and 512 total onscreen colors.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's not really easy to convert Gunforce to Gunforce 2 or other M92 titles, if only because the way the program ROM is mapped prohibits a straight ROM swap. You have to pull an extra address line and re-do the /OE decoding in order to map H1/L1 at 0x80000 instead of 0x40000, which is the max a stock GF1 board will do. Your other obstacle is the encrypted sound CPU, which applies a decryption table to the fetched opcodes, but not data.<br /><br />I made a program to decrypt M92 sound programs, where it must be fed a trace log from the sound CPU from MAME, and uses that to build a map of known program counter locations. This mostly works, though corner-case code is not hit if it didn't get executed during logging.
