		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would like to know if anybody as ever used the Famitracker driver before in an game?
<br />
<br />In my first sample that I posted earlier, I started to implement it but for now without success. I didn't have much time to debug to find the cause yet and will try to search more tonight. I'm using V2.0 of the driver.
<br />
<br />If I use the nsf file, remove the header an incbin at the right offset, extract all 3 addresses, I can make the music play but still some issues with maybe overlapping memory space but at least it's playing.
<br />
<br />I guess the question should be asked at Jsr directly but if anybody have any experience on how to use it properly, I would really appreciate any pointers on how to use it well.

<br />
<br />I compiled the driver with my source code and used the same name for the segments for zeropage and BSS like Clueless was doing in is sample.  So if this approach is legal in CA65 then this mean the memory areas where contiguous without having to worry about overlapping since the linker took care of that.
<br />
<br />I must have made a mistake somewhere else. With the NSF, it's obvious they overlap since all kind of things shows on the screen regarding my variables.  With the driver, it goes into a illegal opcode and die.  I may have to ask Jsr to help me a little bit with it, if he have some time.
<br />
<br />Regarding sound effects, I think this is a known issue with the driver (don't know if it with all of them) since I read something about that on the famitracker forum. I don't know if it was corrected because it could be not an issue if the driver was planned for playing music only.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />  
<br />I found why and it was a stupid mistake.  When I refactored a little bit the code to work with segment, I copy/pasted the line to call the init/play method.. What I didn't realize is those line were jmp statements, not jsr statement. So this is the origin of my bad opcodes.
<br />
<br />After that, the sound worked but my sprites were going wilds. This was a conflict with my OAM address that I used at $0200 so I had to change it and now everything is fine.
<br />
<br />So this thread is now closed I guess. I will try to refactor a little bit more the code so it will be similar to the way I work. This may help me find if there is other memory addresses that I should be careful about too.

<br />
<br />Out of curiosity since I have interest in anything related to FT, what did you inject, the song data my hand? Created from FT or manually? For what purpose? I'm just trying to figure out how this reply is related to my previous issue I had.
<br />
<br />Sorry if my question seems dumb, I may have not understood your reply properly.

<br />
<br />I see.  I had a feeling that's what you meant but I wanted to confirm. My brain these days is like jello because of an annoying cold so I cannot think clearly <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Anybody else used it in a game or demo of some kind?  I saw that Sivak tried to use it in his game from the thread I read on the FT forum.  I will try to use it if I can find a way to do sound effects.  
<br />
<br />Just the tracker is such a time saver that I don't feel like making the songs by hand.

<br />
<br />Don't worry, I will be more than happy to share what I find once I understand properly how it works <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />From what I see, the driver is for playing songs only, which is normal since it was made for FT and not for games. The only way to make it play sound fx will be to adapts the driver for our needs.  That means I will have to study the code, no choice.  But first, before I even go into details about this, I need to understand how sound fx are done on the nes.
<br />
<br />I don't know about how it works but I will try to explain how I think it works conceptually. I will need people feedback so I can know if I'm right or not.
<br />
<br />The nes as a certain amount of channels depending of the mapper used.  Those channels are used for music. There  is no dedicated channels for sound fx.  Because of that, while a song is playing, we have to use existing channels.
<br />
<br />What I'm not sure is, when a request for a sound fx is done, does it:
<br />
<br />- Stop the song channel(s) and play the complete song effect
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />- 1 frame the song is played, the next the sound fx is played , etc until the sound fx data runs out
<br />
<br />That's the part I'm not sure yet.  My guess is the first one since when you play a game, the channel affected seems to stop completely.
<br />
<br />Once we can add this functionality to the driver, the next step will be the data format.  Should we use FT data format for sound fx too or just hand made ones?  
<br />
<br />Any comments on the subjects will be appreciated for my quest for sounds <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think that when a sound effect is played, it steals the channel from the music, and it only returns when that sound effect is completed. So the music would have the lowest priority.
<br />
<br />So music continues to play, it just no longer updates the sound channel while the sound effect is using it. You can't share the channel between music and sound effect, it'd be one or the other. So music would be interrupted.

<br />
<br />This is a nice idea but it could require a lot of re-factoring in the FT sound engine. The resulting data is sent to the hardware in the apu.s file but it still does some processing before doing it.
<br />
<br />I'm getting closer to get sound fx but with a different approach.  You have a variable in the sound driver that will contains bit flags. This variable will tell FT driver which channel to de-activate.
<br />
<br />When you want to play a sound fx, you set which channels to de-activate first, then you start to play your sound.  On the next call to the FT play event, the driver will check the status of the channel at the end of processing the data. We don't have any choice to do that since the song still need to be processed.  If the channel is deactivated, the driver will skip the part regarding sending the data to the hardware.
<br />
<br />Once your sound fx is over, you just re-activate the channels you de-activated.
<br />
<br />I was talking with JSR and this is the approach he suggested, the same I had in mind.
<br />
<br />I can already de-activate channels, I just need to try to play some kind of sound fx before I can show a "proof of concept" but it's coming.
<br />
<br />Edit:
<br />
<br />After coding during lunch, I was able to play some (terrible) sound effects at the same time the music was playing. Since I don't know how to set the registers with what data, I cannot produce interesting sounds yet.  But still, the proof of concept was accomplished!
<br />
<br />Now I need to understand more on how to create sounds so I can create my sound fx engine.
<br />
<br />edit 2008-10-23:
<br />
<br />The experimental version offered here before  was not good enough to be used in production code. I will put a link to the latest version in this thread:
