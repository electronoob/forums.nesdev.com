Furthermore, the buttons and D-pad are so almost identical to that of the DMG ones that they are swappable. Really, I don't see that anything is gained here except volume and a difficulty in storing the device...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Really, this project is just something that I was excited about having for myself - and I figured that it could be worth throwing it out there to see if there are 100 other people in the world who feel the same way! if it seems pointless to you then I guess you're not one of those people, and if it turns out that those people don't exist then so be it... I am already happy to have made it this far with the project, and I won't mind if it ends with you saying &quot;I told you so&quot; as long as you promise not to kick me while I'm down! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I wanted to avoid copying and pasting information verbatim from the project description that I have already provided a link to because it feels redundant to me, but it seems unavoidable at this point so here goes:<br /><br /><em><div style="text-align:center">The possible applications for the uXeBoy are limited only by your imagination:<br /><br />Combine the uXeBoy board with a GameBoy shell, a small LCD display, and the microcontroller / microprocessor board of your choice &#40;AVR / <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" class="postlink">Arduino</a>, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" class="postlink">Raspberry Pi</a>, <a href="http://beagleboard.org/" class="postlink">BeagleBoard</a>, <a href="http://www.gumstix.com/" class="postlink">Gumstix</a>, etc.&#41; to create a do-it-yourself handheld device!<br /><br />Alternatively, you could leave out the microcontroller / microprocessor and connect the uXeBoy directly to your video game console &#40;or a PC running an emulator&#41; as a sort of &#39;enhanced&#39; NES control pad with a built-in screen - just like the good old <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021124060420/http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/categories/products/product.asp?pf_id=230723" class="postlink">Hip Gear &#39;Screen Pad&#39;</a>, but twice as awesome!<br /><br />Another option could be using a microcontroller to turn the uXeBoy into something like <a href="http://tinycartridge.com/post/80525211/bandais-mega-controller-for-nes-i-remember" class="postlink">Bandai&#39;s &#39;Mega-Controller&#39;</a> - and have the LCD show customisable settings and parameters, and maybe throw in a tilt sensor? You could design your own system around using the uXeBoy&#39;s screen as a sort of &#39;second display&#39; like the Wii-U <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U_GamePad" class="postlink">&#39;Gamepad&#39;</a>. Or leave out the screen altogether, design your own enclosure to fit the uXeBoy board and make a pint-sized mini-control-pad!<br /><br />You could follow the concept to its logical conclusion and make a miniaturised replica of the NES motherboard to fit inside the back-half of the GameBoy shell - or use something like the <a href="http://papilio.cc/" class="postlink">Papilio FPGA</a> board to create a <a href="http://danstrother.com/fpga-nes/" class="postlink">virtual implementation</a> of the NES motherboard!<br /><br />Many video artists and musicians use a GameBoy as their interface for performing - for them the uXeBoy could open up a world of possibilities for new performance techniques, while still maintaining the familiar interface of a GameBoy!</div></em>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did read the entire page, but &quot;the possible applications for the uXeBoy are limited only by your imagination&quot; left me feeling like I was missing the point, because this really seems to have only one very specific purpose.<br /><br />It's a nice looking board that you've made, and I'm sure it mounts very nicely inside a GB case, I just think it's weird that you want to replace the one that already comes with the GB instead of just modding that one to output the kinda signal you want.<br /><br />Anyhow, good luck with it. I don't really mean to poo-pooh it, but I don't personally understand the goal so I was hoping you'd explain more about what it's for. The suggestions on the page would apply to any controller, of which there are plenty of ready made varieties. The special thing about this project is that it fits in a GB case, but there is already a controller built into the GB...

Relying on anything that wears out mechanically and cannot be replaced, such as the dwindling supply of NES controllers, is a bad idea long-term.<br /><br />In any case, there's probably a way to do this without destroying a working Game Boy, and it involves making a Game Link to controller cable and a program to emulate a controller. As I understand it, both the NES controller protocol and the Game Link protocol are just SPI (clocked serial).

Cool project for sure!  I like how you gave this thing its own name.  So the point of this thing is to not &quot;destructively mod&quot; the gameboy controller pad?  Destructive mods are the best mods!  Sacrifice hardware in the name of science!
