A different (non-Nintendo) game could also be used, but tepples chose to use an independent homebrew, which is universally safe.  The case linked in previous posts already demonstrates, through both photos and text, that Nintendo at least <em>right now</em> is being sensitive.  As I said earlier: in cases like this, small additional details end up setting precedents for future cases.<br /><br />In short: it's not worth the risk.  You may disagree and that's fine -- I do agree that using a game &quot;that everyone knows&quot; brings better comprehension of information, but right now the risks are higher.  This may also be a matter of perspective given our geographic origins: you live in a country where DMCA doesn't apply, while I do (as does this site).  And no I don't want to get into a discussion about laws of nations (but yes I am aware of Denmark's strange stance on dealing with piracy, which seems to vary depending on who's in the position of Culture Minister that year).  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />To my knowledge, Denmark doesn't have any strange stances on it, and aren't doing anything to help further piracy - quite the opposite (or maybe that's what you are referring to?). Personally I'm a strong opponent of genuine copyright violations.<br />DMCA is a crazy concept for sure, but it has absolutely nothing to do with posting pictures of copyrighted material. Fair use applies internationally, otherwise we wouldn't be able to have (potentially) unbiased press coverage of anything.<br /><br />I think you are being way too paranoid.

It now looks like this.&quot;), that <em>could be</em> troublesome to the same extend, even though there isn't a single intention of promoting copyright infringement, and I don't think they should be replaced or removed, unless &quot;something&quot; really happens(this is one of the reason the homebrewed test ROMs exist, but you can never be completely sure with the accuracy if you only use test ROMs).<br /><br />Tepples' example is good though, as it still is a good idea to replace such content with a more legal alternative whenever available (read: as long as someone cares to make the alternative version), so that in case &quot;something&quot; happens, we won't have say, Wiki pages explaining some technical aspects with a big red X(the screenshots mentioned above are more temporal, and they more or less serve their purposes once the problems are solved, so it isn't as large a problem losing them).

What i meant was that it’d be beneficial to show a loop of the game scrolling in real time prior to all of that, which would serve to bridge the gap of not having a precomception of the game and its behaviour.

That particular site drew their attention because not only did it distribute a vast library of games, new and old, it also provided an online emulator that enabled direct play to the pirated wares.  Marrying ROMs with emulation crosses a line.  They also tagged on trademark violations because the site profits from ads and donations.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />- Instead of Nintendo spending time and money trying to sue someone for hosting old roms, just spend that money instead developing a brand new hot game that people will buy. <br /><br />- You can sue all you want, but thanks to the internet no matter how many sites you take down just as many can pop back up. No one can defeat the internet. <br /><br />- My advice to video game companies is to make great games and make profits on them, but also know when to let them go. If your game is 30 years old and people are hosting it for download then that is just the natural course of things. Don't worry about the past, but focus on the future. Don't protect old games. Make new ones. <br /><br />- Sites which host roms give free publicity and advertising to the original companies and characters. A person may download some roms and fall in love with the characters, then as a result they go and buy merchandise in the form of stuffed plushies, action figures, statues, figurines, amiibo and display them in their rooms thus supporting the companies after all. <br /><br />- Piracy to some extent can help the video game industry. In some countries some people do not have access to certain games or game consoles and piracy may be one of their only options. For example, Brazil is notorious for not importing good from other countries. <br /><br />- Instead of Nintendo shutting down fan games and rom hacks, why not create a partnership program were the game can be hosted on an online store for download and the profits are split between the developer and the company. Don't go against the flow as a company. If there is a market for fan games then allow it. <br /><br />- Any company who acts like their copyrights and trademarks are the most important thing in existence is living in a false reality. Copyrights eventually expire and games will enter the public domain soon enough. One day you will actually legally be able to host Super Mario Bros 3 for NES on your website and actually charge for the download when it enters public domain. If a game enters public domain and someone makes a rom hack of it, they can then get a new copyright on it to protect their new work. <br /><br />- No video game company should treat their fans like crap issuing take downs and suppressing their fan made work. The reason why a company earns profits and can exist in the first place is because it is the FANS who buy their products. The customers make the company. A company without any customers cannot exist in the long run. A video game company owes their existence to their fan base.

Whouldn't their legal department answer the question if it comes from one of their customer?  I may be too naive but I wouldn't mind to ask them. I may ask them (without any hope of an answer anyway) like I did for Battle kid v3 issue in Japan. At the least Columbus answered, I woudln't see why Nintendo wouldn't answer an honest question isn't it?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Maybe i'm paranoid, but i'd advise against it. <br /><br />-Even if new games for the NES are perfectly legal, so were unofficial games in the 80/90:s. They were still targeted. <br />-their official stance on freely available emulators is very negative, since so many individuals use them as means to play illegally copied games (piracy).<br />-It doesn't matter that NesDev user have a great code of conduct and care about the legality of things. In effect, big companies are sometimes more concerned with control than legality. <br />-A lot of the knowledge base we have here was retrieved with reverse engineering, due to lack of a good full documentation. While it works very well for something like the ben heck show to reverse engineer gadgets as entertainment, it is easy to see why a company who has produced the object that has been reverse engineered would be alarmed. It's not in their control, and thus, a warning flag.  <br />-I’d guess that insofar some part of the corporate body in question is aware of NesDev, it’s view on it islinely muddy and conflicting. It takes a lot of assessment (work) to have an insight in what NesDev and its wiki is. The answerd we’d get, if any, would not be a guarantee for anthing, or a full-bodied declaration of N:s views and intentions (which are also likely to change over time). I would assume an answer would be improvised by a staff member fairly within a field guidelines. The staff would need to spend a lot of time assessing the question. Maybe it needs to be taken higher up, and then it’s a reversed SNAFU. <br /><br />The risk i’m seeing is All it takes is one beaurocrat who is either overzealous, nervous, or feels the need to demonstrate that s/he is contributing to some metric of their deparments' rate of efficiency, to bring unnecessary trouble to the table.<br /><br />Besides, many of us are involved in commercial activity such as releasing physical cartridges and sometimes hiring each other. To the taxman, that’s for-profit ventures. It’s no good claiming homebrew is nonprofit. While it’s very hard to turn a profit and noone is looking to get rich here, it’s not a nonprofit hobby. I’m not sure why the profit/nonprofit statement would be relevant at all. Assuring it is nonprofit (again not true for many of us), implies that it would somehow be fishy if it was. I wouldn’t want to spread that idea.

In a worst case scenario, that would actually result in them officially speaking against homebrew, but more realistically they would probably just avoid addressing it directly.<br /><br />If companies start to openly condone anything without employing lawyers to fully research any consequence, they'd probably be afraid that even something like a twitter post saying &quot;people doing NES homebrew is cool!&quot; would open the floodgates for illegit romhacks, etc.
