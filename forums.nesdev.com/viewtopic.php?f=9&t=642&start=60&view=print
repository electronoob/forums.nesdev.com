<br />That reminds me...I heard there were two versions of Wai Xing Zahn Shi, the Phantasy Star IV pirate original.  Kev, was it you that dumped the newer version of the rom I heard about? And does anyone know what the differences were?  I've gotta find that game one of these days...I've never seen anyone sell a copy.

<br />Kev, what was wrong with your Panda Prince...the broken one? Obviously not repairable, I take it....cracked glop?

<br />It won't be too much longer now.   The NES "emulator" I wrote for CopyNES was fully debugged and then I added some PPU emulation so that it should be able to (slowly) run some games.  As stated before, this is for debugging stubborn ROMs and things like that, and obviously not for playing games <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />The audio works like normal, as do controllers and mappers and other things- the "emulator" just reads and writes to memory like usual so if sound regs happen to be there, they get written to.  same with mapper regs and what not.
<br />
<br />Theoretically, the emulator SHOULD be able to run itself, since it will move the stack around to compensate but it may hit itself due to the way the relocation works.
<br />
<br />The entire emulator takes up 18 or so bytes of RAM at the top of stack to run.

<br />Why do you have to put 470 ohm resistors in series with the data lines in some cartridge adapters to stop sprite corruption?
<br />
<br />For instance in my homemade NES/Famicom adapter.

<br />
<br />I"m not 100% sure why, it seems to have something to do with the speed of the ROM device... you usually see this when using an EPROM emulator.  I don't know if the ROM is too FAST or if it's too slow... in any event, the resistor-adaptor is a very good thing to have when dealing with prototyping and hard-core copyNES use.  Some carts will actually crash copyNES (very rare.. very very rare) but if they do I have that adaptor.  The main culprit was those Sachen games.   Never had a problem with just regular old NES carts or most fami's except N106 which can cause problems since it has a register in the same space as copyNES' port chip... this is the only known conflict, however.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Update:  I have the NES on NES emulator (hehe good term for it) going for the most part, but it's kinda buggy and I can't seem to find the bugs in the PPU emulation.  I've posted the code for anyone who wants to look at it and possibly see if they can find a problem or two, but it may be kinda difficult to figure out without a real CopyNES or something :-/
<br />
<br />Other than that, things are going good and I've been polishing the host software and such, and adding more features to it.  That connector SHOULD be here this week or next, and then I will start accepting orders.
<br />
<br />In the mean time, I have been writing a "CopyNES how to" guide on assembling the PCB, installing it in the console, etc.  so when the part comes everything is ready.
<br />
<br />Here's the code if anyone wants to poke around.  
<br />

<br />
<br />Note that I use some of those undocumented opcodes here and there to speed things up, and because they are so darned useful <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> Wherever they are used though is indicated in the code, since I had to enter them manually as a .db followed by a .dw.   Unfortunately, the code is pretty hard-core.  I've gone over the PPU operations with a fine-toothed comb and can't find anything amiss.
<br />
<br />Btw if someone wanted to try running this on an emulator, they could do it by putting RAM at 4800-480f and commenting out the "use port chip" code and uncommenting the "use RAM" code (clearly marked).  I was using the port chip registers that were free as extra RAM bytes to save space.  "emul8" runs 1 instruction.    Note that the actual 6502 emulation part works just fine, and it's only the PPU emulation that is somewhat buggy at the moment.

<br />
<br />A couple of questions though:
<br />
<br />1.  I assume it will let me dump carts for at least most known mappers.  Will it have any trouble with different boards in these mappers?  I have a skeprom board that I'd like to dump without trying to desolder and use a eprom reader.  Could people who have dumped using a copynes tell us how it's worked for them?
<br />
<br />2.  Is the software still dos?  Has anyone had any luck with it in dosbox?  Should I be looking for a 98 system right now?
<br />
<br />3.  Do you think there are enough going around that I may be able to get 2?  I'd love to get a complete one and also try building one from a kit.  
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<br />Yeah the software is still DOS, unfortunately...  not much I can do about this.  It needs W98 or earlier to run because it uses direct port access.  It *might* work with a driver on XP that allows direct port access, but I've never tried this so I don't know if it would work or not.
<br />
<br />Yah there's enough to go around hopefully.
