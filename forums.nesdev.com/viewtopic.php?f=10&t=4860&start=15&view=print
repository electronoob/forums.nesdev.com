<br />
<br />Also, you say that you need to avoid getting a mess of branching. What do you mean by this?
<br />
<br />BTW I'm sorry I didn't see that you posted here on the 16th, I probably would have posted a reply.

<br />I have tried counting upwards, because I want things to happend after 8, 40, 70 frames. (More to come <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> )
<br />But I failed, because the NSF stopped playing, and the text showed up instantly.
<br />
<br />Mess of branching - Count upwards, compare, branch if correct frame.
<br />In other words, if I have a lot of text I want to change, there would be a lot of branching.
<br />Unless you can say something like , If this frame is equal to X, do the next line, else, don't do the next line.
<br />
<br />And don't worry about you didn't see I posted. It made me do a lot of experiments on my own  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay, about the NSF. It sounds like you're having RAM conflicts with that. Make sure you aren't using the same variables in RAM that the NSF uses. Otherwise that will screw things up.
<br />
<br />Secondly, why exactly is happening after 8, 40, 70, etc. frames? Are you writing 1 character or a string of characters to the screen? Because there are better ways to go about this. One would be:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ldx WaitIndex&nbsp; &nbsp;;starts off as 0<br />lda FrameCount<br />cmp WaitTable,x<br />bne NotWaitedEnough<br />inx<br />stx WaitIndex<br />...Whatever you do once you've waited a correct amount<br /><br />NotWaitedEnough:<br />....Whatever you do if you haven't waited the correct amount.<br /><br />WaitTable:<br />&nbsp;.db 8, 40, 70 ....<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />And the best thing about that is that you can still keep the value as 8 bits, and you can wait anywhere between 1 and 255 frames.

Make sure you aren't using the same variables in RAM that the NSF uses. Otherwise that will screw things up.<br /></div>
<br />I doubt I have RAM conflicts, because I haven't added any new variables after I've added the NSF (I have a couple of unused variables), and have made sure the NSF have enough space.
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, I want it, after the frames, to print short strings onto the screen (Under 20 chars)
<br />I find your code there good enough to use, but how do I make it print the correct string?
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">print_at 0,26,text&#91;WaitIndex&#93; ;&#40;text1,text2,text3 ext.&#41;</div>
<br />Not sure exactly how you do it in Assembly, but maybe have it load the text, equal to the WaitIndex value?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Using WaitIndex would definitely make sense. But you'd have to have a table of pointers to the strings, probably, since each string has variable length. I seem to recall you had a table of pointers, right? Well if not, you'll need to make one:
<br />
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">PointerTable:<br />&nbsp;.dw Text1, Text2, Text3<br /><br /></div>
<br />
<br />Where .dw defines the low and high bytes of the label.
<br />
<br />Perhaps ditch the macro for now and do it in straight assembly. It'll be easier to deal with.
