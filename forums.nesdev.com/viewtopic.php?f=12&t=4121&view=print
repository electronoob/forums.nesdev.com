<br />
<br />If you ever decide to build a cartridge of the translated version of the star ocean, don't follow any guides on the net, really...
<br />They're plain wrong, I'm not exactly sure why, but it certainly looks like none has ever actually compared chunks of the translated version, with the original. That way people assume, that it needs a TWO 27C322 or 27C322+27C160 memories...while truth is that only first 4MB differ from the original image, remaining 2MB are the same in both versions...

<br />
<br />It's weird that this info seems to get found and then lost again for some reason. I seem to remember seeing this info (2nd rom is the same) a few years back and it was discussed and then it's like everybody forgot it.

<br />Now the only problem is my programmer is only 40 pins!!! I have to make a ghetto adapter and control some of the address bits manually <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />

<br />Also replace the battery while you are at it, its 12 years old already!

<br />
<br />I can't remember what speed I used, but I think it will work fine.
<br />
<br />32 on the 27c322 has to go to 44 on the mask rom (be careful about the 42 eprom vs the 44 on the mask rom!). Everything else lines up if you pretend that pin 2 on the 44 pin rom is pin 1 on the 42 pin eprom.
<br />
<br />No donor worth mentioning other than star ocean itself.

<br />Yes, I know the usual arguments: a PSP costs more money, the remake isn't exactly the same,  fan translated carts are "cool", etc. All of this destruction is just going to keep raising the prices for those who would actually collect and preserve the original.

<br />Yeah, wasting my time here. Nobody's going to care / listen. Whatever. I was hesitant before, because I need to expand FEoEZ for a very important optimization, which would make sticking it on a cart impossible. This is yet another justification for doing so.

<br />
<br />Actually I do agree with you because if you want to play Star Ocean on the real system you are better off getting a Game Doctor SF7 with 96mbits of DRAM to use neviksti's hack that removes the need for the SDD-1. It would probably be better if people would make their own hacked cartridge by making a 96mbit one than destroying Star Ocean cartridges. And I had no idea it was coming out on PSP, that's cool. I'll have to check it out.
<br />
<br />But you are right, no one is likely to listen. People don't believe you when you tell them there is a finite amount of copies of each game. And they seem to have the illusion that they are the only one smart enough to hack up cartridges/destroy cartridges.
