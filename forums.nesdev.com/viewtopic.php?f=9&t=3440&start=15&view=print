<br />Imagine pressing a certain combination of buttons to switch back to BIOS menu to pick a new game, or, perhaps being able to browse/edit RAM (for simple hacking purposes perhaps).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The software pause is definitely possible because the powerpak does something similar when it detects reset. The only difference would be that it would need to nondestructively interrupt the game (is there any free FPGA RAM after 4-screen/EXRAM?). If it could do that, it could probably real time save as well which allows for cheat finding!
<br />
<br />Action replay codes would be possible I think with a special SRAM file and new FPGA config file which can disable GG codes (perhaps the current one can?). You'd need game genie codes which patch the NMI vector to point to code in SRAM which modifies the RAM values you want, then disables the game genie, reads the real NMI vector, enables game genie, and jumps to the real vector. It'd be nice if the bootROM could set all that up for you though.
<br />
<br />I think it would be nice to have a way to load/save cheats from/to a file which can be enabled/disabled through a GUI, AFAIK this is how all modern cheat systems work. 
<br />
<br />It would also be nice to use all the free logic in mappers to expand the number of cheats possible.
<br />
<br />It would be REALLY nice to have reconfigurable hotkeys to enable/disable the Game genie but this doesn't require a bootrom update :)

<br />I don't know... executing extra code while the games run (to check for the specific button sequence) might break them, even if if it's just a little bit of code... So I don't think this is such a good idea.

<br />No extra code would be run until the game is halted, button checking can be done in hardware by adding a serial load shift register decoded to the controller ports. The outputs would be XNORed with a programmable button register then those outputs could be ANDed to trigger a match.

<br />OK, so this would be for a possible future version of the PowerPak, one with a connector hanging from it that you could plug between the controller and the NES, right?

<br />That is why you make it programmable, it's not likely that any game uses every combination of buttons.

<br />I don't have any in mind, but technically this is an annoyance : You may just write a NES programm and check how it reacts to buttons. On emulators, they cannot take more than ~3 keyboard touches at the same times, and on the real hardware the power pak would interface and change the results.
