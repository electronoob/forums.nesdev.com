Awesome, Gilbert that is exactly what I was wondering and was one of my concerns about the diffrences in languages. Do you know of a resource I can read up on which you have mentioned of heavy changes? I know this wont happen right away but I am interested in doing what I can over time.<br /><br />If someone else comes out with it before I get to it, then I would be happy!! mission acomplished!! Although I will keep working at this till I finish unless something happens unforseen. (knock on wood)<br /><br />I do not have a script yet but I have been watching this on youtube trying to figure how much space will the english have to take up it has given me and idea what I am up against. I do think if i cut things short it would serve its purpose but i think I rather keep learning and find fixes.<br /><br />That vid on youtube. Kudos who has done this video for Akira! Most excellent!!

Technically this depends on the game.<br />Your method will work, if the game is simple enough.<br /><br />Since Akira is a (possibly) text-heavy adventure game it is quite possible that the texts are all compressed in the ROM, so unless you figure out the compression scheme and decode the messages you may not be able to find the texts from it.<br /><br />Another problem is space. In general Japanese messages occupy much less characters than English (this is the case for most Eastern vs Western languages), so you may not be able to accurately translate a line within the original number of characters most of the time. For example, in your first screen shot, the first four characters "so no yo ru" translates to something like "that night", which takes 10 characters (including the space), so unless you use funny internet abbreviated languages such as "u r g8!" you may need to do surgery in expanding the size of the ROM (which will involve much work as this also messes with the addresses of the messages and the like). Not to mention that sometimes the original text boxes are not big enough to display the translated messages, and that means more work.<br /><br />So, while it is not difficult to do graphic hacks and message hacks on certain <a href="http://www.zophar.net/hacks/nes/gradius/chodius.html" class="postlink">simple games</a> it may not be the case for all games and "professional" translation hacks often involve lots of tweaks and changes to make things work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4653">Gilbert</a> — Wed Mar 30, 2011 2:03 am</p><hr />

I played around with advice I have learned from previously. I have a question about a project I am working on, i added a couple screen shots on where I am starting.  My question is if you think this will work and if not what can I change to make this work?<br /><br />My goal for right now.<br /><img src="http://i1134.photobucket.com/albums/m609/RenegadeKhyron/Akira2-1.jpg" alt="Image" /> <br /><br /><br />What I am working with........ <br /><img src="http://i1134.photobucket.com/albums/m609/RenegadeKhyron/Akira1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />*Build my character table -(I have found the complete english alphabet capitalized with in the game and added this to the table, and considered making the entire translation capitalized so no graphic editing needed. Though i thought that would might cause problems possibly to large and taking to much room possible? That and might as well try to do it right.)<br /><br /><img src="http://i1134.photobucket.com/albums/m609/RenegadeKhyron/Akira3.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />*Write out the complete text of the game (or see if anyone who has done it already will work with me if possible.)<br /><br />*Follow each word in the script with the code it uses and write it under each word in script.<br /><br />*Replace Japanese character graphic with an english lower case character graphic till lower case alphabet complete.<br /><br />*Use english translations done in accordance with the script and write the new code under each english translation changes that will be made.<br /><br />*Open rom in hex editor and follow the japanese script and follow first word in script by entering the code written earlier in a search in the hex editor when highlighted enter new code translation if need less words work with script or more words to fit use blanks?<br /><br />Think it might work or will it bomb because of something i am missing in my logic of how it works? <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4825">Khyron</a> — Wed Mar 30, 2011 1:08 am</p><hr />
