		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello,<br /><br />I am Bock and run smspower.org where we deal with sega 8-bit stuff, so admittedly Nintendo isn't my most natural element =)<br />I hope this post is in line with the rule/etiquette of this community. (This is a cross-post from something I posed on NintendoAge and I was advised to also post here.) (I also not sure if that's the most suitable sub-forum but it seemed to be the best.)<br /><br />For an upcoming contract job, I am looking for a reliable and skilled NES programmer/designer to contribute in making a short platformer game for an event. The job would be paid.<br />Normally I would attempt to do it myself but I am a little swamped with my work on hacking/remaking Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap (see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.TheDragonsTrap.com/blog..">http://www.TheDragonsTrap.com/blog..</a><!-- m -->.).<br />And I only have indirect NES experience so it would take me longer to catch up. So I would like to find someone who has great NES experience. I'd be merely coordinating the people involved (dev, music, making handful of carts.. those skills also desired but I'm first looking for the dev/lead).<br />The person would need to:<br />- have proven track record in the form of programming and possibly designing a functional, quality NES game/demo.<br />- be willing to work decent hours. A full-time job would be ideal but being realistic I expect that on short-term notice someone may not be full-time, so part-time would also work!<br /><br />This would be a serious paid job (by serious I mean- the person would work under my direction, be paid an actual salary, and expected to deliver).<br /><br />Please e-mail. You can find my e-mail address at miracleworld dot net (bottom of the page).<br />Not being an expert of the NES scene it can take me a while to evaluate candidate/skills, so including various NES and non-NES references is most helpful.<br /><br />Thanks! &lt;3<br />Bock

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So, no words about the actual contents of the game or the deadline for that special event. You basically told nothing at all about the game except that it's a &quot;short&quot; platformer. (Short like in &quot;Pac-Man&quot; or like in &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;?) Way to go.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The details would be under NDA and I don't have them all yet.<br />I think the reference point would be Super Mario Bros in term of general vibe (side-scrolling, early NES titles visual quality). Few levels (say, 3 type of visuals, 3 levels), done in a few months. The game doesn't need to be very long. And obviously I don't expect a game to be as good as SMB in term of gameplay (if it is as good as SMB I want to work with the developer forever).
