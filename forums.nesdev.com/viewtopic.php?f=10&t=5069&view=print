		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm quite new to hacking roms and NES programming.  I'm adept at Visual Basic and Q Basic programming but nothing with hex editing yet.  Learning as I go.  My goal is basically to combine two games, pro wrestling and River City Ransom.  So I would essentially like to map River City Ransom sprites over the Pro Wrestling Sprites.  I'm figuring as long as I at least have similar animations (same amount of frames, same size, etc.) I can somewhat change the moves slightly.  I'm pretty sure I can accomplish this in Tile Layer Pro.
<br />
<br />The most ambitious thing I would like to do is change the title screen on Pro Wrestling.  The thing with the screen is that it re-uses several tiles on it, which I would like to get the "River City" cursive writing from River City Ransom and place that over the "Pro" from the Pro Wrestling rom.  I'm figuring this would have to be done in hex editor with the mapping.
<br />
<br />I've looked at a few of the hex editor tutorials, which I'm getting for the most part, I think I need to dive in and get some more hands on expirience with it to really understand it.  Do you think changing the title screen in possible?
<br />
<br />Ultimately I'd love to change the moves around and add entrances to the game to really make it a unique game, but I know that's quite some time down the road, if it can be done in general.  But hey, that's why I put ambitious in the title <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Thanks everyone for any help and pointers you can give me in advance.

<br />
<br />If you're going to be adding graphics like that, note that the words PRO WRESTLING use very very few tiles.  You're in luck though, Nintendo was very wasteful with their cartridge usage here, so you can just add more tiles into the blank spaces.

So basically use that space for the River City logo, then use the hex editor to replace the mapping to those tiles?
<br />
<br />YY-CHR is that much better than Tile Layer Pro?  The tutorial I was reading used Tile Layer Pro, so I DL'ed that.  Personally I'd love to find a Tile editor that you can copy a tile and paste it elsewhere (like from rom to rom), that would make things a whole lot easier.  Instead of the exporting as a bitmap, then importing the bitmap after editing.  So, so tedious.

<br />Well, the deal with UxROM boards is that they use CHR-RAM. This means that there is no clear distinction between what's PROGRAM and what's GRAPHICS in the ROM file, because all games that have CHR-RAM manually copy the graphics from the ROM to CHR-RAM. Some games store the graphics in a compressed form (it's probably not the case with Pro Wrestling since you can see the graphics in a tile editor). Compressed or not, you'll probably have to mess with the code that copies tiles to CHR-RAM if you want to put additional tiles there.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks everyone for the responses.  I dl'ed YY-CHR, which it was really helpful for River City Ransom but Pro Wrestling is still a garbled mess to go through.  River City Ransom is still pretty garbled in areas.  In the tutorials I read for YY-CHR they're always dealing with SNES which the sprites are all neatly together in the file, why can't the NES ones be the same way?  It would be a thousand times easier if they were.  Does anyone know any shortcuts to get them in some semblence of order?

<br />
<br />I think there might be a problem there because I'm noticing re-used tiles everywhere on the screen.  So I think that if I did try to change the blank data it would repeat all over the screen.  Also I would like to have the River City replace the Pro on the title screen.  Which I think means I would need to recode.  But if you can think of a way I could do it with no coding whatsoever I would love some help.
<br />
<br />Thanks again everyone!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You probably don't have to modify any code, but you'll have to debug some in order to find where the game is fetching the title screen data and pattern table data from in order to modify that data. What complicates things is that the data might be compressed, so you'll either have to crack the compression format (which shouldn't be too complex) or find some extra room for your uncompressed data (which would probably need custom code for copying to VRAM).
<br />
<br />You could use FCEUXD (or another FCEU with a good debugger) and set up a breakpoint for name table writes and activate it right before the title screen is displayed. The code should give you a hint as to where the title screen is stored. If the data is coming from RAM, you'll have to set up another breakpoint to detect when that RAM was written to, and then you'll probably know where the data is coming from. Take a look at the code that is fetching that data and see if you can figure out the way in which it was stored (uncompressed, compressed, what compression). Once you crack that it's just a matter of storing your own data using the same format and have the game read that instead.
<br />
<br />It's not awfully complicated, but you have to be able to understand what the assembly code is doing, and know the basic architecture of the NES in order to know which locations are ROM and which are RAM, which registers are used for what and things like that.

<br />
<br />This is funny because the way your wrote this it seemed to run off very quickly and it was a bunch of steps.   So this sentence struck me as funny because it was so many steps and then you followed it up with "it's not awfully complicated".  That was awesome!
<br />
<br />You're right though, after I read through all your steps again I'm basically deconstruction the steps in the program, which I've had to do a thousand times in Visual Basic.  I'm very new with Assembly though, so I'll have a bit of a learning curve.
<br />
<br />It looks like I'm going to have to do some more reading, it's been a dream of mine since I was like six to make my own Nintendo game... no time like the present.
