Maybe 16 KB CNROM games just used additional CE because the ROM manufacturer did offer such CHRROMs, and they were compatible with 32 KB ones ?<br />I'd ask why no game has ever intentionally disabled the CHRROM while rendering the screen in order to get black portions on the screen, this would allow it to disable the screen while it's still enabled trough $2001, for example to have a black bar without affecting the scrolling counters inside the PPU (battletoads does a similar thing, however it switches to a blank nametable, I wonder what would be the result if the CHRROM would be disabled that way).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Jul 30, 2007 2:41 am</p><hr />

I have not (and hopefully will not) seen that scenario.

If the actual ROM is 32K, then an accurate ROM dump should also be 32K (I don't care if Cowering calls it an overdump or not).<br /><br />My personal opinion is that CHR bits 4 and 5 probably don't need emulation, because no game using those diodes will ever intentionally cause a bus conflict (unless the developers were really dumb).  An emulator that was in the business of bus conflict simulation would also need to emulate bus conflicts with most discrete logic boards when writing to PRG space.  And I'm not about to suggest adding a bit to the INES header spec that says "Emulate bus conflicts."  Unless a bus conflict is predictable in nature (as is the case with that one odd Color Dreams mapper variant), there isn't really anything to gain by adding bus conflicts.<br /><br />Proper emulation of the CHR disable feature, on the other hand, is a necessity.  Nestopia currently uses an alternate-state approach, where the CHR is enabled after every other write to $8000-FFFF.  This obviously isn't hardware accurate.<br /><br />Have you ever seen a 16K CNROM game that uses D1 instead of D0 for CHR bankswitching?  If such a game exists, it cannot be mapper 3 (nor 185) because the bankswitching algorithm will be different from a standard 8K CHR switch.  A 16K CNROM game with D1 as a disable line should be assigned mapper 185, once that mapper has proper emulation (which will require the NES 2.0 sub-mapper field).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Sun Jul 29, 2007 6:24 pm</p><hr />

I don't know why this didn't click with me before, but I just realized that most 16K CHR CNROM behave the exact same way. Regarding pin 26 &amp; 27, 26 is a valid address line (A13) and the other is a CE line. And again it will varies whether it is enabled high or low. So some games will read open bus for the first 16K and others will read open bus for the last 16K.<br /><br />None of them currently fail emulation because they do not perform checks like the FC 8K ones do, but they certainly could.<br /><br />DK Classics is one exception I've run into, you just get mirrored data instead. In this case pin 26 would be A13 and pin 27 rather than being a CE line is simply NC.<br /><br />So a couple changes I think that need to be made to correctly emulate CNROM would be:<br /><br />1. File format needs some way to explain the function of pin 26 &amp; 27.<br />2. In the cases where 1 or both pins are CE lines, need to emulate open bus condition when ROM is not enabled.<br /><br />A funny thing I noticed, the US version of Mighty Bomb Jack still performs the exact same check that the FC version. It even still writes the correct value to D4/D5 as if the diodes were installed. The reason it passes the test? They used a 32K ROM instead of 8K, and the ROM regions that were open bus on the FC cart are FFh-filled.<br /><br />On that same note, this game is currently in the DB listed as 16K CHR, due to the way the plugin does it's size detection. Even though the last 16K is useless, I feel it should be kept as 32K. Any arguments on that?<br /><br />EDIT: clarified a bit on pin 26 &amp; 27<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Sun Jul 29, 2007 5:33 pm</p><hr />

NES 2.0's sub-mapper field should come in handy here.  I don't know what kev's plans are for the sub-mappers, but my proposition would be something like this:<br /><br />For m185: submapper = "dcba"<br />a = proper state of D0<br />b = proper state of D1<br />c = proper state of D4<br />d = proper state of D5<br /><br />For m3: submapper = "dc11"<br />c, d = same as m185<br />11 = bits must be 1 for emulating this CNROM feature.  If either bit is clear, assume a simple 8K CHR switch with no fancy business.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=360">dvdmth</a> — Sat Jul 28, 2007 4:04 pm</p><hr />

You are correct, pin 26 &amp; 27 must be CE's on these carts, plain and simple. If they are not enabled correctly, you get open bus, regardless of how D4/D5 are setup. Not only that, but whether they are active high or low must be dependent on the ROM itself. So basically the only way to know this is to either look at the code and see what the game does, or trial and error. Perhaps the last 2 digits of the ROM serial number might mean something, but those are almost always different from cart to cart.<br /><br />So as far as emulation is concerned, D4 and D5 are not important (but they shouldn't be ignored either). They just have to be set properly when dumped otherwise you get corruption from the bus conflicts.<br /><br />INES, without working something into the 2.0 spec can't handle this properly, and UNIF would have to have an additional tag created.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Sat Jul 28, 2007 3:37 pm</p><hr />

I bet that the result is open bus (the CHRROM itself being disabled) but no bus conflicts will appear.<br /><br />By the way, I noted that the board used for Gradius (J) has slot for 4 diodes, only 2 of them being used, also NES-MHROM-03 has slot for 3 diodes and some NROM boards also have slot for 2 diodes, it would be a good idea to check up this too.

Heh, I think I'm going to have to go back and look overs these again! I don't think I'm wording things correctly, I never meant to imply D4 &amp; D5 control actual CE lines, by "enabled" I just meant not in a bus conflicted state. IIRC, when these aren't set correctly, you will get varied results with either device winning the bus like you said. What I need to double check is what happens with these 8K games, when D4 and D5 are set properly, but D0 / D1 are not. I'll take a look in a little bit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=158">BootGod</a> — Sat Jul 28, 2007 2:17 pm</p><hr />

The carts could check if the conflict happens, but the result is unpredictable, because the PPU can win and have no particular restults, or the mapper (and diodes) can win and mirror the CHR ROM in a weird way, possibly damaging the PPU itself.

That's not entirely the case (right now anyways). Mapper 185 is for 8K CHR games only, the other CNROM games that use D4 &amp; D5 still work fine under m3. Those 2 bits need to be set properly when dumping the carts, but in emulation, they work just fine without having to deal with them because the CHR is always enabled to begin with. This really isn't the accurate way to go about this and should probably change in the future.
