		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is there a way to check if a certain ROM is the good one of a specific game?<br />Some time ago, I already had some issues with Cowering's GoodTools and now I found another curiosity:<br /><br />Take the game &quot;Soccer&quot;. The ROM that is declared as &quot;Soccer (JU)&quot; (i.e. the &quot;real&quot; version) in GoodNES 2.01 is declared as &quot;Soccer (JU) [b1]&quot; in GoodNES 3.14.<br />So far so good. But you know which one is the good ROM according to GoodNES 3.14? It's the one that in 2.01 was declared as &quot;Soccer (GC)&quot; (the Game Cube version).<br /><br />How is this even possible? I mean, if 3.14 has it right, then how was it ever possible for 2.01 to declare it as the Game Cube rip? If I ripped a game from an actual original NES cartridge, then how on earth is it possible that anybody took my image and said: &quot;That must be the ROM image from the Game Cube release&quot;?<br />Besides, in 3.14, the Game Cube release is missing in the list.<br /><br />So, how do these discrepancies come to be? And is there a way to actually, reliably check the version of the ROM?

It once helped me to get the PRG0 versions of games on eBay. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />But is there a way to determine the ROM if you only have it as a file? For example, in how far could I use the CRC32 from that site to check a &quot;.nes&quot; file? After all, in such a file, you can change the header information. Or sometimes, the first few bytes are overwritten with the word DiskDude. But it's still the same ROM and GoodNES would still recognize it as the same. So, what do I have to do with the &quot;.nes&quot; file to check it against the CRC32 value on that website?<br />By the way, what do you mean with splitting ROMs?<br />And where can I find the SHA1 value and what would I have to do with it?

GoodNES used to even change RBI Baseball into Mapper 4 (MMC3) with Horizontal Mirroring, because &quot;we shouldn't have any defaults for mappers that have mapper-controlled mirroring, so leave it horizontal&quot;.  Except RBI Baseball isn't MMC3, and it does have hardwired vertical mirroring.

A user of a PC running a Linux operating system would have to install an entire runtime environment called Wine to run programs designed for Windows and another called Mono to run programs designed for the .NET Framework. But because a user ordinarily runs more than one Windows program, the effort in downloading Wine can be spread among all Windows programs that one uses. Likewise, the effort in downloading Python can be spread among all Python programs.

Years later, Nintendo releases the same version of the ROM as bonus content in <em>Animal Crossing</em>. One of the cart dumps is found to match the dump extracted from the <em>Animal Crossing</em> disk image, and one of the cart dumps is not. To be safe, whoever writes one version of the ROM database tags the dump that matches <em>Animal Crossing</em> as (GC). Later on, the (GC) dump is verified good by users of CopyNES or other ROM dumpers, and it becomes recognized for what it is.

The wikipedia article shows it step by step how to do it by hand; then, you realise that you can achieve the same thing with a kind of modified &quot;Galois&quot; LFSR that shifts your data in the LFSR and XOR it with your polynomial.

Every language has it's own run-time decadency unless it directly links against the kernel library. Even that's a run-time, it just happens to come with your OS. And for that matter, most Linux distros come with a few dozen run-times <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.
