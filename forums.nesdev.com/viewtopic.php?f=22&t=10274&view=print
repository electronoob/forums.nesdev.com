	</div><br /><br /> It is a version of the puzzle game &quot;Mastermind&quot;, where the player has to guess a four symbol code from a possible selection of eight symbols.  Make your guess using the D-Pad, and submit it with the start button.  The game will tell you how close you are to getting the code right:<br /><br />A red dot means: &quot;Somewhere in your code, you have a symbol that is not part of the code&quot;<br />A yellow dot means: &quot;Somewhere in your code, you have a symbol that is part of the code, but is in the wrong position&quot;<br />A green dot means: &quot;Somewhere in your code, you have a symbol that is part of the code in the correct position&quot;<br /><br />More info about the rules can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)" class="postlink">here</a><br /><br />It has both a one-player and two-player mode.  In the two player mode, the second player sets the code, and the first player has to guess.  In one-player mode, the computer sets the code, and the player has to guess.  There are even two difficulty modes for the 1P mode.  Normal has the computer set a four symbol code consisting of non-duplicating symbols.  Hard mode lets the computer set a code that may or may not have duplicates.<br /><br />This demo version is without music.  I hope to make some passable stuff with famitracker at some point.<br /><br />I would love to get some feedback about this.  While I know that puzzle games are a dime a dozen for homebrew beginners, I hope that you will take the time to play this game that I have worked so hard on.<br /><br />Thanks!

As for the title, maybe if I ever decide to do anything for real with this game, I'll change it.  For now, it's just a fun little project I've been working on.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I played it for a while, nice little game.<br /><br />For the final version, I would suggest you to spend a couple of minutes polishing the screen transitions. You're turning rendering off/on in the middle the screen, which causes the transitions to seem glitchy/amateurish. You can see this if you frame step the transitions in an emulator like Nintendulator. Waiting for vblank before turning rendering on/off should be enough to get rid of the glitches/partially rendered screens.

The game was practically unplayable!  The problem's been fixed and the fixed version is available to download.

I'd recommend slightly more contrast: either a black outline or change the card background from $13 to $23.<br /><br />Why doesn't A act like Start when the rightmost symbol on a row is selected?
