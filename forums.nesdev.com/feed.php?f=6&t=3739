I looked at both SMB2 and 3, Journey to Silius and Hebereke. They seem to Hide thier music engine in RAM. What trick did they do to initialize like that,<br /><br />In FCEUXD (all versions) It seems to be hidden. Did they Initialize it before PRG-ROM/RAM appeared. IF so, How can I put music from Journey to Silius in Hebereke or Put SMB2 music in SMB3, ect.<br /><br />I know this requires pointing to a new PRG-ROM address(8000-FFFF range in RAM) in the ROM<br /><br />One example is how SMB1 stores it's Music, It stores in ROM format, Same in the 8000-FFFF RAM range!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=287">Hamtaro126</a> — Mon Nov 26, 2007 8:39 pm</p><hr />
