<br />
<br />This is pure speculation, but as you know the 6502 does dummy memory reads, and writes, and some illegal opcodes like 2-byte NOPs do memory addressing with no apparent reason, all this, including the BRK byte-skipping, make me think that there are internal workings of the chip that may make it do this apparently useless things for no reason.
<br />Maybe the BRK operation needs for some reason to further increment the PC, and the 6502 designers thought that skipping a byte was not so serious.
<br />Or maybe they designed it with an argument to jump to different subroutines whose vectors were to be stored somewhere but then dropped the idea, but didn't correct the instruction's byte length.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The question is, the assemblers used to build NES commercial games in the 80s would add an extra byte for BRK mnemonics?
<br />Or did programmers have to do something like:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">BRK<br />.byte 00<br /><br />&#40;or&#41;<br /><br />BRK<br />NOP</div>
<br />It's very unlikely, but what if some programmer forgot to pad the BRK (and didn't do anything to correct the returning address) and entered an actual instruction after BRK and somehow the game still worked despite skipping that instruction's opcode? That would be really hard as the interpreting of instructions from that point would be off by one byte.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What would be really hard? The 6502 should have no trouble, and neither should an emulator. Usually it will "correct" itself fairly quickly, since it's less likely that the intended instructions just happen to also be interpretable at an offset as a separate stream that <em>never</em> intersects. It's more likely that one of these alternate instructions is of a different length than the instruction it's embedded in, causing the two streams to merge. You can experiment yourself with a disassembler that handles unofficial instructions, and try disassembling some code from various offsets.
<br />
<br />If your assembler treats BRK as a one-byte instruction, you can always just have your BRK handler return to the stacked address less one. Or define a Brk macro which accepts a one-byte operand. It might have been that it saved a few transistors to have BRK push PC+2 on the stack. After all, BRK is always presented as a debugging aid, where you don't really care the specifics of its operation since you can compensate in the IRQ/BRK handler.

Kinda nifty.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there's no interesting code at the BRK vector, just an infinite loop. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
