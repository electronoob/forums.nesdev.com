		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gave it a try.  Something is quite wonky with keyboard-based input for movement; it seems holding down a key (Up/Down/Left/Right) causes some pretty severe issues.  Games I tried included Jackal, Contra, and Karnov; the truck in Jackal would twitch/gradually move forward (move, stop, move, stop), the player in Contra would gradually move forward (move, stop, move, stop), while Karnov acted like he was having seizures and wouldn't move at all.  However certain other games like Arkista's Ring seemed to behave mostly okay.<br /><br />It's as if the code used for joypad input is &quot;releasing&quot; the button held every frame, because it happens very rapidly.  I can't tell if this is a NES $4016/4017 emulation problem or an actual problem with your input routines in Windows.  I'm thinking it's possibly a little bit of both, since games like Arkista's Ring just require you to tap U/D/L/R once to move that direction, while the other aforementioned games require you to actually hold the pad down.<br /><br />Since there's no joypad support (that I can tell) I can't see if that works better.<br /><br />System is Windows XP SP3 (32-bit), running DirectX 9.0c (dxdiag says 4.09.0000.0904).  I am not using any crazy drivers (like Microsoft Intellipoint) that insert themselves into the keyboard driver input chain; everything is pure/raw USB HID.<br /><br />I can make a video of the problem if needed; just ask.<br /><br />Other things, probably minor:<br /><br />- Does &quot;Reset&quot; actually do a 6502 reset (jump to reset vector, etc.), or is it a power-cycle?<br />- Looks like Control / Master Volume shows the &quot;Mute&quot; checkbox checked even though sound plays regardless; clicking &quot;Mute&quot; seems to have no effect, so maybe it's a no-op for the time being?<br /><br />Otherwise looking very, very promising! *thumbs up*  It's also nice to see a windowed-mode emulator doing Vsync properly (from what I can tell so far -- it would help if the input stuff above wasn't acting weird though, then I could try panning around and look for tearing).  :-)
