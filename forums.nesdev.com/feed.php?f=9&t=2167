Hmm, yeah, I ran into the LoZ map bug when trying out the FDS. Agreed, there is no substitute for the real thing, but the Neo Fami has worked OK so far, aside from that bug and the whacked sound output (strange pulse channels, too-loud DMC.) Eventually I'll grab an AV Famicom off eBay, but what I have works for now. Also, side B on the various disks does work, it's just that FDSLoadr is quirky and requires retries sometimes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1013">commodorejohn</a> — Mon Nov 27, 2006 3:34 pm</p><hr />

Update: I tried it on another computer, and it worked at least partially; it loads fine from side A, but it either takes a long time loading from side B or it doesn't work on side B. I checked the BIOS settings on the original computer and the parallel port was *not* set to EPP mode, so I'm going to give it a shot in the proper mode.<br /><br />At any rate, progress has been made.

If the .fds file loads in an emulator, then then the file's good.  If not, then the file is probably corrupted, so use a different one.<br /><br />Anyway, quadruple check your wiring, then do it again.  Also, make sure you are running in pure DOS...no Windows, and definitely not Win XP.  Having a machine loaded with Win 98 works for me (well, I do have to boot to pure DOS, but you know what I mean), but just a pure DOS box will do the trick too.<br /><br />Also, you may have to set your parallel port in your BIOS to EPP mode.  Also, it probably won't work on most laptops.  Even so, try it on several computers, if possible.  Some parallel port's controller chips are ghetto shit, but this is mostly a problem only on laptops, and possibly, though unconfirmed, some small form factor desktops.<br /><br />It sounds like a wiring problem, but try the above and let us know.<br /><br />-Rob<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=200">rbudrick</a> — Fri Nov 03, 2006 9:34 am</p><hr />

Well, I made my first attempt at hooking up the RAM cart to the paralell port today, but no luck. The program and cartridge seem to be communicating with each other (the "disk in" signal is accurate and the program recognizes read attempts,) but nothing will load; it always reports an error 22 on the first file. Is this 22 decimal or 22 hex? 22 hex seems to mean, from the FDS technical reference I have, that it's expecting a file type of 1. 22 decimal doesn't seem to be a valid error code. Does anyone have any idea what's going on here?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1013">commodorejohn</a> — Thu Nov 02, 2006 7:23 pm</p><hr />

Well, the Neo Fami arrived today, and it works fine, with one quirk: the quarter-phase pulse output, for some reason, gets output as a half-phase pulse wave. I've only tested it with Final Fantasy so far; my guess (I'm not sure about this) is that perhaps pulse setting 3 (three-quarters phase, which sounds the same as quarter-phase) was overlooked and treated as half-phase, but I've yet to confirm this. The Famicom Disk System adapter boots fine, but I've yet to build the cable for further tests.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1013">commodorejohn</a> — Thu Oct 19, 2006 9:47 am</p><hr />

Well, I looked up some reviews of the Neo Fami and the general opinion was that it's a good deal. (The price is definitely right.) One user mentioned that their unit broke after a few uses, but the company I'm buying from will allow returns on defective units, so I think I'll go with it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1013">commodorejohn</a> — Mon Oct 09, 2006 3:13 pm</p><hr />

The easiest way to make the FDS end of the cable (for reading disks and rewriting them, if your FDS is equipped to write), is to use a SNES audio/video cable.  Make sure it has all 12 pins, though!  I bought mine from Lik Sang.  If the tip has all 12 pins (as thier stock did 2 years ago), you should be good. The plug is almost identical to the FDS plug, except the FDS plug is rounded on 2 corners and has right angles on the other two corners. whereas the SNES plug is rounded on all 4 corners.  THe SNES plug also has a lttle strip of plastic you have to shave off.<br /><br />Of course, the other method is to sacrifice a RAM adapter's cable for this.<br /><br />Now, for the PC to  RAM adapter cable for loading games directly from the PC to the RAM adapter, I used the audio video port from a broken SNES.  Remember that since the RAM adapter's plug has those two sharp corners that you must carefully cut away two corners on the inside of this port to make the Ram Adapter's cable fit in.  You could shave a bit off the two corners of the RAM adapter itself, but it makes more sense to do it to the female sideso you don't go putting the cable in upside down, not that you couldn't label it or something.<br /><br />You can also sacrifice a FDS Drive's port for this, but it's kinda wasteful.  The good news is that you can always hardwire the sacrificed ram adapter and FDS together after you snag the necessary components, only you won't be able to use that sacrificed system with FDSLoadr, just the FC.<br /><br />-Rob<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=200">rbudrick</a> — Thu Oct 05, 2006 9:50 am</p><hr />
