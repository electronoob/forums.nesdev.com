So if Kirby is an antagonist in Link's Awakening, and Lolo is an antagonist in Kirby games, does that put Lolo on Link's side? Are Lolo and Lala the larval forms of Ice Climbers?

It's kind of interesting that Lolo and Lala &quot;made&quot; it into the Kirby series, and as antagonists at that. They are one and the same, always paired in Kirby, unlike Eggerland. Starting with Dream Land I and onto the SNES and beyond. I see that Hal is similar to Nintendo with combining its franchises, just like DK and Mario in its early days, where DK was evil and then Mario in DK Jr.<br /><br />I guess overall the series of Lolo was not popular enough so they combined it with Kirby? Or possibly it was 'okay' so they made it a Kirby thing to increase popularity? --ShaneM<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5262">ShaneM</a> — Wed Nov 12, 2014 11:54 am</p><hr />

This is one of my favourite gaming series!<br /><br />I think there are some misconceptions about the series though. Here is a summarize of the series:<br /><br />Eggerland - MSX<br />First game in the series exclusively for MSX computers and it's 100% linear. It's pretty slow and doesn't have as good music as the rest of the series. It seems there isn't an ending in the game, you are just abruptly taken back to the title screen disappointingly enough. It has a construction mode (level editor) though and 100 puzzles plus a few secret ones. It also has bonus levels were you can egg all enemies including Medusas!<br /><br />Meikyuu Shinwa / Eggerland - MSX / Famicom Disk System<br />The MSX version doesn't have Eggerland in the title in Japan but in Europe it's called Eggerland 2. The Famicom version is called just Eggerland just like the first game. The Famicom has different music and a new ending and saving instead of passwords. This is the first grid-type of Eggerland game where you sometimes have to enter rooms from a certain direction in order to solve them. This game has lots of those puzzles that involves fast reflexes as you have to run from Almas or avoid Don Medusas with very precise timing. Then there are the secret bonus levels that also requires good control of Lolo.<br /><br />Eggerland Meikyuu no Fukkatsu - Famicom<br />One of the biggest games with lots of challenging puzzles. It has a grid based maze like the second game but has passwords instead of saving since it's a cartridge game.<br /><br />Eggerland Souzou e no Tabidachi - Famicom Disk System<br />Rare FDS game that was only released as a disk writer game AFAIK. Souzou means creation and that refers to the fact that construction mode is back! It's only 50 puzzles though. This one is linear like the first game.<br /><br />Adventures of Lolo - NES<br />This wasn't released in Japan and is probably designed like an introduction to the Eggerland series for foreigners. It's linear like the first game but you finish a puzzle on the door after collecting the key unlike the first game and Souzou e no Tabidachi. It uses music from Meikyuu no Fukkatsu and most puzzles comes from earlier games, not just Souzou e no Tabidachi but also lots of puzzles are from the first game and Meikyuu no Fukkatsu (or if Fukkatsu and Souzou also stole puzzles from the first game, I'm not sure). It only has 50 puzzles and none of them have any rule-breaking soloutions like some of the earlier games has. I think this is also the first game with a brick floor instead of the all black? The MSX version of the second game had brown floor if played on an MSX2 though.<br /><br />Adventures of Lolo 2 / Adventures of Lolo - NES / Famicom<br />This was released in Japan but without the &quot;2&quot; in the title, hence the confusion in the names of this game and its sequel. It's linear. I heard a few of the puzzles are slightly harder in the Japanese version.<br /><br />Adventures of Lolo 3 / Adventures of Lolo 2 - NES / Famicom<br />I haven't played this one much but it doesn't appears to be 100% linear since you can choose worlds. Just like the prequel some of the puzzles are said to be slightly harder in the Famicom version.<br /><br />Lolo no Daibouken / Adventures of Lolo - GameBoy<br />Have hardly tried this one. You play as Lolo's and Lala's son.<br /><br />Eggerland Episode 0: Quest of Lala - Windows 9x<br />A free downloadable prologue prequel to promote &quot;Eggerland for Windows 95&quot;. It's more than just a demo though as it takes place before Eggerland for Windows 95 (and thus before all other Eggerland games), has many unique puzzles and you play as Lala. It has new features like reflector stones which can reflect magic (so you can finally egg a Medusa!). You kind of need Japanese Windows 95/98 to get it to work as it should though. Construction Mode is back and you can now download user created puzzles from internet.<br /><br />Eggerland for Windows 95 - Windows 9x<br />This is a retail game and uses the same engine as its prequel Episode 0. Now you play as Lolo again though. I haven't played this game but its story sounds like it's a retelling of the story of the very first game for MSX back before Lolo and Lala was married (they supposedly get married after the first game although you don't see it in-game as there's no ending in that game). <br /><br />Fukkatsu! Eggerland - Windows 9x<br />I don't know much about it but it seems it's a re-release of Eggerland for Windows 95, updated with more puzzles and the ability to to run on Windows 98 and Windows ME. It's said to be the biggest Eggerland game with its 194 puzzles. All the windows Eggerland games are reusing some puzzles from earlier games but also has new ones.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6013">Pokun</a> — Tue Nov 11, 2014 3:55 pm</p><hr />

The numbering scheme is puzzling too.<br /><br />Aparently, there is two FDS games plus one Famicom game of the &quot;Eggerland&quot; series, which were not released in the western world. Then two famicom games called &quot;Lolo&quot; follows, which are equivalent to the western 2/3, exept that the levels are completely different (i.e. only the intro screens and the music are the same).<br /><br />The only difference between the &quot;Eggerland&quot; series and the &quot;Lolo&quot; series is that Eggerland has a black background whether Lolo has a nice brick background.<br /><br />As for the difficulty, for all the japanese games it is just insane. It took me something like 15 tries to beat the very first puzzle of Adventures of Lolo (J). It is however fun.<br /><br />What disapointed me is that some puzzles actually requires action or reflexes to beat, which I don't like it doesn't fit a game like this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Nov 10, 2014 9:15 am</p><hr />

Ah, the Lolo games. I used to play the second one quite a lot as a kid. Recently I got Eggerland for the Famicom, but I haven't beat it yet.
