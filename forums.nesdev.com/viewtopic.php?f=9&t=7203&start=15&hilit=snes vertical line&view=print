<br />I'll have to give DScaler a try one of these days.

<br />
<br />Which USB capture device do you have? The latency of different devices does seem to vary. There are different components of latency though; there's the driver latency which is (probably) unavoidable, and the viewing/capture program latency.
<br />
<br />Some viewing/capture programs (e.g. WinTV) add to the latency so are not very useful for interactive use. DScaler and the Microsoft amcap.exe don't seem to add much latency, so it's worth trying one of those.
<br />
<br />Also, capture devices with hardware compression are unsuitable for interactive use since they can add several seconds latency. And the image quality is degraded of course.
<br />
<br />With at least some devices, you may have better luck using Linux rather than Windows. For example, I have a Pinnacle Systems PCTV USB2. In Windows, the driver adds some latency. Maybe only half a second but that's still far too high. However using it in Linux with tvtime, there was no noticeable latency.

<br />It's TerraTec Cinergy *somethingsomething*. Couldn't find it from their homepage anymore. I'll give it a try some time soon, it would be nice to capture stuff from NES in a reliable way.
