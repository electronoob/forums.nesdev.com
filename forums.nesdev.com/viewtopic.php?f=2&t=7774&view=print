<br />Although it wasn't and would never be anywhere near what Retro City Rampage is, digging through the old code and stuff there's still potential there. Knowing what I know now a pretty decent GTA game could be pulled off on the NES. The main issue is sprite flickering (which is why the sprites are so small). We put up with it in so many games (TMNT), but I feel like it'd be even more annoying in GTA.
<br />
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQKWWDOeLIs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQKWWDOeLIs</a><!-- m --> (flicker demonstration)
<br />
<br />I doubt I'll ever have time to finish GT, but it would be fun to dig back into that stuff one day. First thing I would do is build a source level debugger into an emulator integrated with Visual Studio or another good IDE. Having something like that would take NES development to the next generation.
<br />
<br />Cheers

Thanks for the videos and stuff, hope this can get you into the world of XBLA/WiiWare games, seems like a great start. Sad it never saw a release or completion, but it goes to show what can  be done.

<br />I've been in the industry for nearly as long as the project's been in development so that gave me the "in" I needed to start my own studio. The new pseudo-8-bit project Retro City Rampage is indeed coming to XBLA and WiiWare later this year <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />As far as I recall, I posted everything I knew about MMC5 on BriPro.com. Archive.org should have the stuff. I can't remember if I discovered anything groundbreaking.

<br />
<br />MS aggressively forces exclusivity upon all XBLA games they "publish". Despite them not giving a penny to the developer or any promotional guarantees, it's exclusivity or no XBLA for you. The only other option is going through another publisher such as EA, but I'd already spent 6+ months pitching and negotiating and although I was in talks with other publishers, biz takes a lot of time and negotiating is draining. Had I continued pitching to other publishers the game would've been delayed even more due to so much of my time spent on biz, not enough finishing the game. It was very eye opening though and a learning experience for the future.

<br />
<br />I think this game will be a huge hit either way, suck they don't allow you to put it on the PS3 market too. And knowing how far it got just on the NES, I can't wait to see what awaits for the 360 version.
<br />
<br />I am assuming the Wii version is done and the 360 version is still being ported....so since it's 95% done, what shall be your next project? Think it'll be another 8-Bit remake? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />Still finishing XBLA stuff then there's stuff to finish on the Wii. Mostly the system specific fluff like Wii menu integration, etc.

<br />Lots of ideas for the future but focusing on the task at hand right now, getting RCR out the door.

<br />
<br />Also, how much resources did you have to get to obtain the Wii Developers License? I looked at it and it seemed pretty big and something now only one person could take the chance to do.
<br />
<br />Did the NES version get someone to fund it? If so....there could be a decent number better NES demos being made if that was also a option in the later future for their games?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Getting licensed by console devs requires tons of hoops to jump through. #1 is you pretty much need industry experience (or in special cases have an high profile indie award winning game). I've spent thousands on incorporating costs, legal fees, devkits, over $10K on office rent, etc. It's no easy task. Getting a game onto XBLA costs more than people realize, even if it's 100% done. Testing, localization, worldwide ratings, etc. will run you $50K-$100K, although your publisher can handle this you'll be paying for it in the end (and then some).
<br />
<br />If you want to become a licensed dev, get a job in the industry for a bit. Heck, even if it's only for 6 months. Also be aware though that the biz side of even running a tiny company+doing PR is a full time job. Everyone underestimates this, myself included. Then again, if I knew how much work it was, I might not've done it haha. But in all seriousness, it's best to start a little console dev with a team, not by yourself. 
<br />
<br />
<br />There was no funding. I just worked on GT and then RCR part time until two years ago when after years of saving I had enough to quit my day job and pay for all of those expenses above. It's fully self-funded.
<br />
<br />In this day and age though, people are lucky because of the AppStore, etc. for far simpler distribution. A lot of people would disagree with that comment, but let me explain. Yes, the AppStore is saturated. Yes almost ALL games lose money. However, it's really not that different from any other platform. Only the top games make money on the AppStore, XBLA, PSN... heck even top games on WiiWare can lose money these days! That being the case, if you want your game to succeed you need to put a lot of work into the quality, polish, making sure it's "fun" at its core, market the HELL out of it... and if you do that, it doesn't matter if it's XBLA or the AppStore.
<br />
<br />To put the AppStore in more perspective, if you do everything to make sure you create a top game which is destined for success (again, make a great game AND MARKET THE HELL out of it), you might sell 15K units TOTAL on WiiWare for $10, or 25K units a DAY at $.99 on the AppStore.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wow, that sound amazingly tough, but still very doable as you say. I understand the app store thing, and I've been told by myself it's pretty much the only way to make decent money without going into a full-blown release. Even if it's only for XBLA, I consider many those games full blown games without disks.
<br />
<br />
<br />And by a job in the industry, would programming and stuff directly associated with making a game be the only "industry" job? Or do you mean something more like working at gamestop, writing articles, etc.
<br />
<br />
<br />I like to listen to the insight on the way you go to the point your at now though. I hope it pays off for you, with how your game looks, it looks awesome. I'm sure others here will also enjoy knowing what it takes, although like me am sad that the cost is so high.
<br />
<br />
<br />Looks like my game may be ion XNA if I ever get to program a modern console. Oh well, I've got many years to work at programming general so it's fine for me.
<br />
<br />So how late into the year are we talking for the release? I need to know how long I have to save my 1500 MS Points. Will it be 1200 or 1600 points? I may need to buy more.
