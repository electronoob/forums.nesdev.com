I meant $25 for just the Famiclone and adapter, but that's only speculation for now.  The $100 or so that tepples mentioned is pretty much in line with what I was thinking if a console could be included with Squeedo.<br /><br />I know the Famiclone I have now (Powerjoy II) has kinda poor quality sound.  It sounds like the duty cycles on the pulse channels are wrong or something.  Seems OK other than that.<br /><br />The info about (the real) Famicom having sound differences from the NES is a myth.  Apparantly there was an older revision of the CPU that didn't work with the RAW ($4011) sample method, but since there were games that use it I suspect it's not much of an issue.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What would be wrong with using the Color Dreams voltage lockout-knockout trick?

There's several revisions of the NES, and there's no method (that I know of) that works with all of them.  I'm just gonna use real lockout chips (from my own cart collection) so it won't be a concern.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Feb 10, 2005 11:03 am</p><hr />

$25 for a famiclone + NES adapter or does that also include a Squeedo?  Famiclones aren't very accurate, are they?  Even the newer ones such as the Neofami are supposedly crappier than emulators such as FCE Ultra.  I have a new in box AV Famicom, but I read some somewhere that the Famicom lacks certain sound channels or something that the NES includes.  So playing certain NES games on a Famicom will cause certain sounds to not be played.<br /><br />What would be wrong with using the Color Dreams voltage lockout-knockout trick?

Grand Theftendo is optimized for MMC5, if a Squeedo version was possible it would look very different, and would have to be re-written in a huge way.<br /><br />MMC5 is totally nuts, it enhances the PPU's capabilities (more tiles without coding tricks and higher color resolution).  Squeedo is fairly passive with the PPU, like most mappers are.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Feb 09, 2005 10:53 am</p><hr />

Any chance that Squeedo can do what Brian needs with Theftendo?  If I can't play Theftendo on a real NES, I won't consider it a real NES game.  It will just be another PC video game.

I asked him about that on IRC. He said that he didn't like the CHR bankswitching for sprites or something. ie, he wanted to bankswitch sprites in less than 1KB chunks + didn't want to use 8x16 sprites (for 8x16 sprite graphic expansion) since his game uses 8x8 sprites. So he might just design a little chip to work side by side with the MMC5 to expand the sprites a little.<br /><br />It was something like that. I believe that he'll prlly make an MMC5 version and then an "expansion" version. It would be really cool if he actually made the chip though. I, in fact, have been also thinking about making a new mapper, but I would defintly not make some software mapper (bogus mapper), and would defintly actually design it.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />On the bright side, MMC5 chips are rare as hell, so having a custom mapper might make it easier to make more than a few carts if he wants to.<br /></div><br /><br />There sorta rare, but I've actually found a few of them. Found CV3 at blockbuster for $2. Found Laser Invasion at flea market for $4, and found RoTTK2 on ebay for $7 so I don't think it's all that rare (like VRC7, and FME-7, and other such mappers).<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Fri Feb 04, 2005 4:19 pm</p><hr />

If he builds the mapper in hardware, that'd be cool.  Seems like a lot to go through tho, if the game will run on MMC5 originally.  It wouldn't be the first one-game-only mapper that has some extra graphics features.
