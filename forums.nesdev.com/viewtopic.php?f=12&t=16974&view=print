I've succesfully used one 27c160 by doing that on a 2DC0N board but that's it.<br /></div>Just to briefly explain this:<br /><br />There's a register ($7F52) in the CX4 that controls, when operating in LoROM layout, whether it expects one 2 MiB ROM, or two 1 MiB ROMs.<br /><br />When the bit is set, ROM1 is enabled for all ROM access and ROMA20 is driven accordingly.<br />When the bit is clear, ROM2 is enabled when ROMA20 would have been high. (I don't know what A20 is doing at this time)<br /><br />In this way, the software could bankswitch between 3 total MiB of stuff, but not more. And FPZ doesn't do this anyway.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The hack may not be compatible with the original Cx4 hardware. The implementation on the SD2SNES and in emulation might be able to support larger ROM sizes while the original can't. If only the S-CPU needs access to the additional ROM and not the Cx4 then you could make a circuit that would work if you prevent the Cx4 from responding to the address range that the new ROM data is mapped. However if the Cx4 needs to be able to access this data and the original chip can't address it then you're probably out of luck.<br /><br />This isn't unusual because in the past many translations and ROM hacks were developed on emulators and later found out to not work on the real hardware.
