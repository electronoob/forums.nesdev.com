Long time no 8-bit <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />I'm working on a design that requires a lot of PPU bandwidth but not a lot of screen space. What I'd like to do is to use a sprite 0 hit to disable the PPU after line 216, then start the PPU writes. I'd then re-enable rendering when I'm done, sometime before line 24.<br /><br />I remember there was a lot of discussion some time back about disabling sprite rendering at the wrong time on a scan line, but I can't find the thread. Also I have read that the Sprite 0 hit flag is cleared during the pre-render scan line and I am unsure if this will still happen if PPU rendering is disabled during that scan line.<br /><br />Can anyone point out the caveats to this method? Example code?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />QBRADQ

Doesn't that make the screen look all funky?</div>The only way to avoid the different dot crawl pattern is to have rendereng enabled at the beginning of the frame. The timing could be tricky, but you could try something like this:<br /><br />-after the sprite 0 hit on scanline 216, disable rendering;<br />-when the NMI fires, enable rendering (you can keep writing to VRAM though, since it's VBlank now);<br />-perform a safe amount of VRAM operations (i.e. don't go past VBlank) and wait for the sprite hit flag to be cleared (this will indicate the start of the frame);<br />-wait until it's safe to turn rendering off again and do it;<br />-make more VRAM transfers before enabling rendering on scanline 24 (there's nothing to help you time this, you'll have to use timed code);<br /><br />Personally, I think this is too much trouble... IMO, the different dot crawl doesn't look bad at all, I'd just live with it. Actually, without scrolling, I think it looks even better than the regular video.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Finding the thread was not easy for me because I couldn't remember the title or terminology used.</div><br />I mean't it was easy for me (since I remembered enough about it to find it), and that I just can't understand the exact problem with the glitched sprites. I just avoid turning rendering off early as much as I can.

Nintendulator doesn't have any filters, AFAIK.

At 20fps, you have 3 frames to upload the data (60 / 3 = 20). Each VBlank is approximately 2273 cycles long, so you have a total of 6819 cycles of PPU access, enough for transferring 852 bytes with the fastest possible code (unrolled loops). A 22x22-tile are is just 484 bytes, plus attributes and the numbers, everything should fit comfortably in the time you have (and you won't even need completely unrolled code). Much better than having to deal with complex timed procedures IMO.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Oh also I'm ignorant of NTSC filters.

The program should keep the same enabling/disabling procedures even when not uploading data to VRAM.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well it's not a single-screen RPG in the sense of Hydlide. It uses a fixed display but the map scrolls (in metatile increments) within the display window.<br /><br />So I've done some experimentation and numbers, and if I try to do it 100% in vblank I can get a maximum of 15 FPS while using over 4KB of code space, or 10 FPS using about 2KB of code space. The issue with these approaches is the input delay. Even though you're getting 15 frames per second you're still waiting 2/15th's of a second before what you did displays on the screen. That may not sound too bad for a turn-based game but in practice it's very noticeable and annoying. That's exactly what I was trying to avoid.<br /><br />Well anyway, I just found the source code to the zeldroidvania project I was working on. I think I'll go look at that some more <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
