The gimmick of the emulator is the ability to display custom true colour tiles at up to 4x resolution. <br /><br />Link:<br />See the attachment of the third message <br /><br />BombSweeper is used as an example and a simple 2x graphics pack is included in the files which replace the number tiles. You need to download and put BombSweeper.nes inside the rom folder. You can play around with the png files inside the BombSweeper folder and see the results. The emulator is still in early stage and so lacks many standard features. Please read the readme for the limitations before using it. Feel free to comment and please let me know if you have trouble running the emulator on your machine.<br /><br />Thanks.</div><br />Hi this emulator is extremely impressive <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.emutalk.net/threads/55446-new-super-mario-hdnes">http://www.emutalk.net/threads/55446-ne ... ario-hdnes</a><!-- m -->! but are there any plans to increase accuracy, compatibility and add support for the missing mappers?

My plan is to make graphics pack for a few games to see what the emulator still needs and implement them. After this I'll work on performance, accuracy, compatibility and missing mappers. Once the performance is good enough, I'll think about higher resolutions and filters.<br /><br />My idea is that since the palette of NES is so limited, it will greatly improve the filter if it is designed to be NES palette specific filter rather than a general filter. This mean the emulator will output the screen as an array of color indexes and the filter will output the final color.<br /><br />I don't know much about libretro so I'll have a look, thank you for suggesting.

Currently the screen is stored as lots of strips (one strip is one row from a tile). Now I'm planning a big rewrite of the screen rendering part for the following:<br />1. group the related strips back into a tile so that the emulator can recognize meta sprite patterns<br />2. store graphics in the texture cache in tile form instead of strips<br />3. split the texture cache into standard size and HD size<br />4. reduce a volume of redundant work by having a better way of storing and searching texture data across frames<br /><br />Then I'll need to update the GUI to handle meta sprite. I hope to make a release before the end of the year but don't count on it.<br /><br />Thank you for your interest!
