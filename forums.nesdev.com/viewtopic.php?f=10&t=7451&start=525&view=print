Jump tables are great when your cases are all consecutive numbers (and you should always try to make it so, since it's easier that way)</div>
<br />That or when your cases become consecutive numbers when shifted to the right. For example, you might have 32 different commands that have up to 8 different subtypes. The commands might be numbered 0, 1, 2, 3; 8 and 9; 16 through 23; 24; etc. In this case, you can still use a jump table as long as you shift out the subtype first.

I was mainly trying to point out that jump tables aren't the exact equivalent of the case statements of high level languages (which might or might not become jump tables when compiled), and if the distribution of your cases is weird you will have to go with the "bunch of IFs" solution.

<br />tokumaru,  my case statement was going to be used with four cases: 0, 1, 2, and 3.    I think I'll go with the comparisons route... it seems possible to me.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />The screen is gray meaning no tiles are being updated in the nametable memory? Rendering is completely disabled? Perhaps just that the attributes aren't updating and are all gray? I guess the easy way to check for some of these is to check the contents of the nametables using a debug emulator. If what's in there looks right but the actual screen is gray, it might be you're disabling rendering somewhere but forgetting to turn it back on.
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It never goes through this code... i dont think.</div>
<br />Does this mean that code is/should not run at ALL or something else? If that section of code is run when you don't expect the PC to reach it, the direct problem isn't the section of code, it's something else.
<br />
<br />There are some odd things in the logic of "attributetable:", but nothing that I think would cause the problems I think you're describing. If it SHOULD and DOES run, but it's just not jsr'd to, what's above what you've posted? What's below it? Have you changed what's above or below it recently? 
<br />
<br />Where do you check for select to start up your song? If it's in your NMI, that's no indication that your program isn't stuck in an infinite loop elsewhere. The NMI could interrupt, check for select, start the song, then return to an infinite loop even for something like:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">forever:<br />jmp forever<br /></div><br /><br />Either way, I see nothing posted that I think would cause a gray screen. My best guess with the info I have is disabled rendering without re-enabling it. If you can check for select outside your NMI and it actually works, your program is probably not crashing, and probably looping just fine. I assume it wasn't gray before, so what was are the most recent set of changes you made where before them the screen wasn't gray, and after it was?<br /><br />Edit: You know what? I have to say this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">attributetable:<br />attributeTable,y<br /></div>
<br />is not the best idea. If you accidentally jmp to attributeTable, bad things will probably happen. If you store to attributetable bad things may not happen if you don't use a mapper, but you'll wonder why you don't get a result. 
<br />
<br />If you have variable/label names that can be typo'd into each other, change them. "Typing error bugs" that the assembler can't catch are the <em>WORST</em> because you can look over the logic again and again and everything will look fine. Be nice to yourself and come up with some separate names.
<br />
<br />Edit 2: And... wait, it kinda just struck me. You can get a song playing? Might it be something in your music engine that's causing the problem? If that's something you have now, but didn't have before it's worth you taking look at.

You can put a breakpoint for that range.<br /><br />But as for the problem, and there's not much to go on. I would just go through and put breakpoints for ranges of all the routines.<br /><br />reset:<br />Otherstuff1:;Maybe checking the joypad?<br />Otherstuff2:<br />Otherstuff3:;Maybe updating tiles?<br />Otherstuff4:;Maybe updating the sprites?<br />Otherstuff5:<br />end;<br /><br />Start at Otherstuff3. If that breakpoint hits, make one for end. If that doesn't hit, make one back at Otherstuff4. If it hits, try Otherstuff5. If it hits, step through it and find out why end never runs. If all the sections of your code are hit like you expect, you have to do a more indepth check in order. Put a breakpoint directly after all the routines that were recently changed. <br /><br />For instance, right now, it seems like no tiles are being written to $2007 at all. (Either that, or your palettes are all gray for some reason.) Put a breakpoint directly after your tile update routine, and look in RAM for the proper values. If that works, check why those values are never being written in the NMI.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The recent changes have been the new code I've posted. I don't remember what was where when... In my coding process so far I try to write the code first... then I play debug... then I run it when it can be run. That's the best I can do right now... I think.<br /></div>
<br />Do you keep a changelog, or backups? If so, I'd start to. Even something simple like this is good.
<br />Version 1:
<br />Added animations.
<br />Add movement.
<br />Version 2: 
<br />Added horizontal scrolling.
<br />Added 16bit movement for sprites.
<br />
<br />I backup my entire source folder for every major change, and keep track of changes. This allows you to only check what was changed when you have an issue. "It was working. I added X, and changed Y. Now it's not. The problem is probably in X or Y, so I'll look at their logic." This also means if you REALLY screw up, you can just copy over the last backup.
<br />
<br />Also, never write super large portions of code without checking them. For an example of something you've done before (tile updating), you could write something that gets the two right most 8x8 tile numbers of a known 16x16 metatile and writes them to ram. Run it, and check to see the write values are written to RAM. Then you write something that writes a whole known column of the tiles to RAM. If it doesn't work, or breaks your program you know exactly what to check. Then, you make your NMI write the tiles to $2007. Then you make it so can write a column at X position. If you write a single routine that does the equivalent of all that without checking any of it, you're in REALLY deep. Especially if you have to rewrite it ALL instead of just fix it.
<br />
<br />And if you have no idea what was changed, you basically have to check the entire program.
<br />
<br />So I guess those were debugging tips, because I have no idea about the actual problem with the information given. It's time to get your hands dirty!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

The problem comes when the existing emulators that run on your computer lack a debugger. It appears most emulators with a debugger are Windows-exclusive and either don't run at all (Nintendulator) or have noticeable practical problems (FCEUX) in Wine on Linux or Mac OS X. That's why I've started to write a 6502 simulator in Python so that I can run unit tests on my Ubuntu laptop. It already runs nestest correctly, matching the golden log from Nintendulator cycle for cycle.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Then, you make your NMI write the tiles to $2007.

<br />And once you do get it correct, you can make an automated test suite that plugs in a few numbers, calls the subroutine, and compares its output to what was expected.
