<br />
<br />Besides, you computer will be useful for a few years. iPad's become obsolete as soon as you either buy an Android product or the next version comes out and Apple chokes the software you can use on it for the same price for a smudge of an upgrade. Plus 320GB hard drive is cheap. 64GB on the iPad you'll be paying out the @$$ for.

Instead of an iPad I'd much rather get an Android Tablet, which are just as good and cost a third of the price. Or get a powerful laptop like you said... It's not as portable, but can do a lot more.

Get an ASUS Eee Pad or a 9th generation Archos.

<br />
<br />The iPad has a bunch of really awesome games you can get for a dollar or two, but it's totally not worth the iPremium, especially for the lack of versatility.  The only reason I could see myself ever wanting to buy one is development purposes or I had a ridiculous amount of disposable income. 
<br />
<br />And this is coming from someone who has an iPhone.
<br />
<br />@Tepples - Hackintosh?  VMWare?  Used MacMini? The 100 bucks a year is pretty crappy and unavoidable though, but probably a drop in the bucket if you actually make money off an app.

<br />
<br />But I do own the original iPad and still love it.  I would say it depends on how you intend to use it.  And other tablets could be just as great or better without the price of apple.  However I would say there are a better selection of apps available for the iPad compared to android tablets.  (Some may disagree)
<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong a tablet won't replace a high performing PC but it's super convenient.  I use it constantly for school taking notes, email, and surfing.  It's something you can actually carry around and use walking from one place to another.  It's great traveling if you can't stand being confined of a phone.  I literally take it everywhere I go and would hate to loose it, but it's more of a mobile supplement than a PC replacement.  It really all depends on how you plan to use it.

<br />So in other words, iOS development is only for commercial developers who develop something for the public to run, not hobbyists who develop something for themselves and their real life friends to run.

<br />Disagree. I was trying to say that the initial investment is potentially recoup-able, and probably one of the smaller sunk costs if you release an app.  The iOS market is still pretty lucrative.  The guys who made World of Goo had a postmortem thingy about it that's a good read.
<br />
<br />I don't think that there's anything wrong with having to make an initial investment to develop for a platform.  I mean, you probably have to have a computer to make a program for a computer (baring any obscure wikipedia link to someone making a computer program out of transistors or something), and although you could probably get away without one I would definitely recommend an NES if you want to make an NES game.  You should probably own an android phone or two for testing as well, if you're serious about it.
<br />
<br />I'm not saying I like apple's game, but it's not that much different that Sony's or Nintendo's or Microsoft's.  Microsoft's especially.

<br />It's a lot better than Sony's or Nintendo's, given that Sony's web site for developer sign-up has been down for eight months and counting, and that Nintendo is a staunch opponent of hobbyist development and home-based family businesses. But you're right that the pricing of the iOS developer program ($99 per year to run your own programs on your own hardware, plus 30 percent of sales) were lifted straight from Xbox Live Indie Games.
<br />
<br />But if you absolutely must run one or more iPad-exclusive applications with no close substitutes, and you do not plan on making your own applications, then by all means buy an iPad.

And most of the programs I write I don't want to write to make money, I just want to write them to write them as most people do. And then the $99 fee basically getting all the people who want to program the device just to do it for themselves. That sucks.
<br />
<br />That's a big reason why Droid is better. It's for hobbyists and developers.

In my response I was thinking in a way that assumed you'd make an app that would return on that 100 dollars and enough to cover the next year, which would no longer require any more money spent.  I realize this is the wrong avenue for me to go down with this argument.  Sorry about that. I will try to address the real issues.<br /><br />We're only able to freely develop for the NES is because it's so old.  If you wanted to program it back in 1986 you'd either be paying money to nintendo or you'd be DEEP, DEEP, DEEP in it technically.<br /><br />I just don't think apple's whole deal isn't really that terrible, although I think it's bad;  it certainly isn't unusual (and it certainly doesn't keep shit apps off the app store).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But you're right that the pricing of the iOS developer program ($99 per year to run your own programs on your own hardware, plus 30 percent of sales) were lifted straight from Xbox Live Indie Games.</div>

<br />But the costs of paying people to develop the app would dwarf the license, wouldn't it?  I mean, more so for bigger developers than for hobbyists...

<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />None of my friends would believe I'm defending apple here, as I usually give people who purchase their stuff (ESPECIALLY LAPTOPS) a lot of crap (even though I have an iphone)
