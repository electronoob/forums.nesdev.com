<br />Bless thanks for technical explanations tepples. If I right understood, this is some kind of hard assert that has affect on emulation, but doing nothing. So it can be freely removed. right? @*Spitfire_NES* look at NstBoardDiscrete.cpp. I don't imagine nestopia without best ever made game - Free Fall =]

<br />Unofficial 1.41 - by Keith Kelly (<!-- e --><a href="mailto:c0d3h4x0r@hotmail.com">c0d3h4x0r@hotmail.com</a><!-- e -->) (March 29, 2010)
<br />----------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />This is an unofficial maintenance release I created to fix an annoying joystick lag issue.
<br />This lag was particularly bad when VSync was enabled.  The original Nestopia author (Martin 
<br />Freij) appears to have abandoned the official Nestopia project on SourceForge and has not 
<br />responded to any of my e-mails, so I am left with no choice but to provide this unofficial
<br />release as a public service to the emulation community. 
<br />
<br />Changes:
<br />
<br />1. Removed manual option to set priority of Nestopia's main emulation loop thread. Instead,
<br />Nestopia now boosts its own process base priority AND its own main emulation thread priority
<br />whenever it is the active foreground window (and/or running in full-screen mode). This brings
<br />Nestopia much closer to real-time performance and responsiveness.
<br />
<br />2. Removed some screwy input polling logic, and added some calls to input.Poll(), to ensure
<br />that the input devices are always polled immediately before the input state is utilized. 
<br />This was the key change that got rid of most of the lag.
<br />
<br />3. Removed some screwy input timing logic that was causing input polling to work only on
<br />certain clock intervals, rather than allowing it to work every time it was called.
<br />
<br />(As far as I can tell on my own hardware configuration, these three changes taken together
<br />have completely eliminated the lag problems that have been present in Nestopia for several
<br />releases.  Your mileage may vary.)
<br />
<br />4. Updated the Visual Studio solution/project to build successfully under Visual C++ 2008
<br />Express Edition.
<br />
<br />5. Added this releasenotes.txt file and bumped the version number to 1.41.

In any case maybe this pack of solutions are somehow worth update 1.41, 1.41.1 to IndyFix extension... but i'm not interested. I rather would like to get some stable part of this to enhance 1.40 version.

<br />Most likely explanation is that at development time Color Dreams had a different board, one with protection against bus conflicts, but they removed that to save money. So the real problem (probably) here is that the Secret Scout ROM is marked as iNES mapper 11, when in fact this non-bus-conflicting variant should be given a different number (if it exists, which can be found out by finding a picture of the PCB of the Secret Scout prototype...). Removing the bus conflict handling code from Nestopia is not technically the correct thing to do.

<br />Nope, that would be vice versa. Mapper 11 is the one with bus conflicts (i.e. doesn't have protection against bus conflicts). We would need to see a picture of the prototype board to see if this hypothesis holds true.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi Plasturion,
<br />I have had a few emails with you.
<br />I have been working on updating Nestopia.
<br />
<br />I don't agree with adding database entries in the source.
<br />for hacked roms that wont play.
<br />
<br />Just get ips win and make an ips file to put in the patch folder,
<br />from original and hacked rom.
<br />Then if you wish, you enable auto-patching, 
<br />or load original then ips from launcher.
<br />
<br />It will apply to current rom, this is another way of doing it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />My latest pre-release Nestopia loads the full set of No-Intro NES.
<br />Of course, I haven't had a chance to play them all through yet.
<br />But they load the first few seconds of intros fine.
<br />2 have graphic glitches, maybe the rom ? more to do.
<br />
<br />I added a virtual stereo mod, which really improves the user experience.
<br />Next on list is changing input to RAW so that with 2 monitors, 
<br />one can be used to browse etc.
<br />While the other runs Nestopia.
<br />
<br />Currently not possible with any known version.
<br />
<br />EDIT: only one from the set has graphical issues now, but that also shows on other emus. 
<br />So set confirmed
