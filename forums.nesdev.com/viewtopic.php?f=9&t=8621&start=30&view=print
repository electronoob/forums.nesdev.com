<br />
<br />Think about it ... How thick you think the bonding wires are, inside of the chip epoxy body ? They're actually very, very thin. So it does not matter. If you put a thin and long wire, you will have added resistance but it has to be really extreme to cause you problems at 1.7mhz...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thick wire, thin wire? Maybe, I don't really know. But one thing I noticed last night was all my test boards use thin wire from IDE cables, and since I got this roll of free network cable I have been using that for my permanent copies.
<br />
<br />It got me thinking. I flash my chips pop them in the test cart and test, my results are pretty consistent, they work. Then I make my permanent copy, not always the same consistency any more.
<br />I am starting to think that since I went to using network cable I have been having less success. 
<br />
<br />Can it really be something as simple as wire thickness, even when dealing with pieces of wire fractions of an inch long to maybe 3 inches long at the most.

<br />And how do you know I've not done just as much or more? Again you on your high horse. But congrats on your 5,000 reproductions and spending 10 years making them.

<br />P.S. You don't realize this but long ago you and I met in person and I can say first hand you have the social skills of, and are about as personable, as a dead cat.

I've never ran into an SRAM that didn't work as CHR-RAM for FF3j.<br /><br />You have a different problem (which I discovered back in 2001 when I started selling reproductions) I have fixed dozens of "other" reproductions (customers sending me reproductions to fix that have pre-maturely failed) and they all have the exact same problem.<br /><br />THE WIRE YOU USE IS SH*T.<br /><br />You can't use 26, 28, 30, whatever gauge solid core wire in making reproductions! I know it's cheap, but it's wrong.  You have to use multi-strand wire.  Years ago, I was using old IDE cable, but I now have a supplier which sells me spools of the wire.  It resists cross talk better, and you can run it for longer lengths.<br /><br />The problem with the CHR-RAM chip is the CHR enable wire.  It's the longest wire in any reproduction (pin 56 on connector) and picks up a lot of noise, and feeds it into the CHR-RAM chip.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant.. tired of fixing bad eBay reproductions.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
<br />
<br />Ive used 30 gauge wire for years, and never had a problem.  So your statement is false.

<br />
<br />I thought about this the other day and recall seeing old IDE cable being used in reproductions that worked just fine. I think D4S did Star Fox like that. And I believe D4S over alot of other people.

<br />I've mostly used 40 pin IDE cables. Some of them were solid cat5 and crappy radio shack wire wrap which was also solid core.
<br />
<br />Most of the lockups/problems I had were from either bad grounds, a pin I thought I could leave floating on an EPROM even though the docs said it was safe.
<br />
<br />I would imagine that PCB traces would be closer to solid core than stranded...
