And also, if we want the PMP on the PIC, we'd be better off just getting it now from the 24F series.  It looks like the 18F ones being made with the PMP are also standard Flash (rather than the enhanced Flash like the 18F4525).  But with them all being fine-pitched parts, as much as I'd like having more I/O pins, I'm not too excited about soldering a bunch of those.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Thu Nov 23, 2006 12:58 pm</p><hr />

Maybe you oughta wait with redesigning Squeedo for just a moment... it seems the lockout chip is about to be 0wn3d finally, and if the CIC functionality could be easily emulated by an MCU and some buffering logic, that mission alone justifies making a custom board with an MCU in it. :)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=106">Bananmos</a> — Wed Nov 22, 2006 3:36 pm</p><hr />

Isn't the M2 line the main 22.??? MHz clock ? If so that'd be fabulous, because you could just made it the external oscillator input for your PIC. However, the lenght of the connector contacts could significantly bring high noise to that fast clock. I don't know if that's what you have been doing, since nobody had any shemtics, and all pictures are down now.<br />1000 times is a lot, but if you manage to programm it on board, it will be actually not quite a lot. The main issues with PICs is that there is so many different version of them with so slight differences !!<br />It's a very fun thing, at work I'm working with PIC 18F252 and 18F2525 wich are the 28-pins counterparts of those you used on your squeedo, 18F452 and 18F4525. That's pretty much a micracle, considering how many different 18xxx there is on the market (above the hundred).<br />PIC24s looks good, but I don't know what you would gain from a 18xxx exept speed, if you use an external oscillator independant to the NES' wich I definitely wouldn't do for evident syncronisaiton issues.<br /><br />Yeah, I agree DIP-40 looks oldscool as hell  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  Actually even DIP-28s looks somewhat oldscool, while DIP-28 large looks just normal. A chip looks oldscool when it's much longer than wide, definitely. However, regardless of looking, a great advantage of DIP chips is that you can just programm them without any expensive adapter. This of course is no longer significant when you get on-board chip programming. An advantage of PLCC package would be that you can use very-low profile sockets to fit a cartridge plastic case.<br /><br />If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask. Many people are very top-knownledged on detailed PPU operations I have trouble to undestand (especially Blargg and Quiestus), and I think I have some experience with hardware stuff such as shematic design and microcontroller programming, so don't hesitate to ask for ideas ! Squeedo sounds great, and improving it sounds even better !<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Nov 22, 2006 12:45 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm unsure of what parallel port you're talking about. You mean the PSP module, or just normal ports you can freely write to and read from ?<br /></div><br /><br />Yes, the PSP.  I did some reading up the other day on Microchip's site, and actually the PIC24 sounds very nice.  Some of them have a PMP (Parallel Master Port) for writing memory, and a DMA too (I'm not sure if that extends to the PMP peripheral, it very well might).  It's a 3V chip with some 5V tolerant inputs, I was getting tempted to design it into Squeedo until I noticed the flash can only be written 1000 times.. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />  That's quite a few times, but very reachable for someone doing PIC experimenting.<br /><br />Sadly (or not, it's a pretty damn fun chip), I'll probably just stick with my current PIC18F family.  Maybe upgrade to the newer one with a bit more flashrom (which would be the 4th PIC upgrade for Squeedo, wow, all with the same pinout too).<br /><br />PMP peripheral is coming to some PIC18 chips too, but they all seem to be "future products".  Probably not a DIP-40 one though.  DIP-40 sure takes up some PCB space, but it looks oldschool as hell and sure beats soldering .5mm pitch pins! <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The double-buffering thing sounds like a fine idea too.  Damn, all this PPU hackery would be a bit easier if we had an equivalent of the M2 line for the PPU.  Really I don't even know if it's been established that the PPU bus ever goes tri-state.  I know it's multiplexed, because it has that address latch internally.  Damn, I should've kept notes when I was working on my crazy mapper a while back, heh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Wed Nov 22, 2006 12:32 pm</p><hr />

Actually one solution that comes in mind would be to use TWO chips of RAM, to crate a double-buffered frame buffer.<br />You'll need a PIC with a lot of I/O pins. Also, there exits SRAM chips with IIC interface, but I think they're rare and much slower than parallel 62xxx SRAM chips. The PIC would just open it's bus on one chip, and deal with the other chip, while the discrete logic componant can read the first chip. On next frame, the bus that was open by the PIC become used, and vice-versa. Not sure how hard it would be to do and how well it would work.<br />Another idea would be to have the PIC only dealing with it's internal memory during the frame, and during VBlank, the programmable componant would trigger a kind of DMA trough the PIC from it's internal RAM to external SRAM/DRAM, and then during the frame the PIC could do it's rendering work again while the programmable componant would adress and read the frame buffer SRAM/DRAM and deal with the PPU bus. That solution sound almost idea, but I don't know if such a DMA is possible on PICs. Maybe on dsPICs.<br /><br />I'm unsure of what parallel port you're talking about. You mean the PSP module, or just normal ports you can freely write to and read from ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Wed Nov 22, 2006 10:48 am</p><hr />

I also drew part of a schematic for allowing the NES CPU to write to VRAM at any time.  Using discrete parts though there were 6 octal bus drivers, amongst other stuff.  It requires a lot of I/O pins any way it's done.  I also never figured out exactly how to generate a write cycle without doing some real dirty tricks or using expensive/rare parts.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />(there exists chips that have a different bus for reading and writing for this kind of purposes...)<br /></div><br /><br />AFAIK they're expensive, very small, and you still actually can't write and read them at the same time.  Seems to only move the pin count over to the RAM chip.  I think it'd be better to use a standard RAM through some wild custom interface like Bananmos mentioned earlier in the thread.<br /><br />Actually right now I'm looking at different chips that I could upgrade my Squeedo PIC to.  Would be really great to switch to dsPIC, but Squeedo uses the PIC's parallel port to great advantage, and no version of the dsPIC has that.  Haven't found a decent way to replace it..<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Tue Nov 21, 2006 1:04 pm</p><hr />
