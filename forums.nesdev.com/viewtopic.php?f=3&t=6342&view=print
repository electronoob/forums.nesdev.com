<br />It really sounds strange to me, but as it is actually possible, some game may do this. 
<br />I've read some Atari 2600 games used to re-use the last opcode of the game logic as the first byte of the sprite data, so you may expect strange things like these.
<br />If not, then one shouldn't care about PC wrapping around to 0 after a PC++.

In fact, I don't see what purpose it would serve for an emulator to "trap" execution at such offsets; how would an emulator know what's erroneous operation and what's legitimate?  It wouldn't.  Best to just emulate the 6502 and let such things alone.  :-)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />PocketNES just emulates the program counter as a 32-bit pointer at all times, except when it needs to figure out its 16-bit value for when it goes on the stack.  The memory page is looked up when it is changed from a 16-bit to a 32-bit value.
<br />Relative jumps are relative to the 32-bit address, absolute jumps, calls, or returns look up the page again.
<br />
<br />So PocketNES dies when a game has non-contiguous banking and crosses pages, and The Magic of Scheherazade does just that when the enemies cast spells on you.
<br />
<br />If PocketNES reached the vectors, it would probably be on the last PRG page, so it would start executing CHR ROM.
<br />
<br />Why bother with the 32-bit pointer and not just use a 16-bit PC at all times?  Because it's so much faster.

<br />It's like putting assertions or other debug checks in code you write; they don't indicate an error, but they aren't things anyone would normally want to do, so they <em>might</em> indicate an error (either in the emulator, or in the code). I've found such checks highly useful for finding emulator bugs. Obviously I remove any which prove to be a source of useless noise due to some game intentionally doing whatever it is often.

<br />
<br />Alright, I'll bite.  I can see it being a toggleable feature in an emulator, similar to halt-emulator-on-BRK or halt-emulator-on-unsupp-opcode, for those who want it.
