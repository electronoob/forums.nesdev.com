		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />As of last week, my home is no longer the last household on planet earth to have an SD CRT TV as its primary television set. Last Friday, my 21&quot; CRT Samsung was replaced by a 32&quot; Samsung Smart TV. I was patiently waiting for the old TV to break before spending money on a new one, but it's been years and the thing wouldn't go, so what the hell. Anyway, today I managed to test some of my consoles on the new TV, not expecting much. To my surprise, the picture was actually very steady, colorful and overall pretty, even through RF. There's much less interference than on the CRT. I also didn't perceive any significant input lag. The only real problem is that the signals are interpreted as 480i as opposed to 240p. This is easily noticeable when sprites are supposed to flicker, because instead of flickering they become translucent with scanline gaps.<br /><br />I'm still contemplating keeping the CRT and moving it to the bedroom (even though my place isn't very big), so that would be where I'd do a lot of my retro gaming, but either way I'd still like my consoles to look decent in my living room. I know upscalers are the answer, but everyone on the internet is recommending devices that cost US$400 and up, and I certainly can't afford something like that, specially considering import taxes and such.<br /><br />So, is there a cheaper upscaler that is known to solve the 480i/240p issue? I don't care that it's not perfect, that it doesn't take all sorts of different inputs (I've never seen a SCART cable in my life) and that the pixels don't show up like crispy blocks (hell, I really like the NTSC artifacts!), I just want my sprites to flicker properly. I don't want anything too cheap that will work inconsistently or break after a few uses, it has to be something reliable.<br /><br />Does anyone know of something like this? Thanks.

The question is: is it total crap? The worst outcome I can think of is if the product is very cheaply built and doesn't work consistently, or if it doesn't handle 240p signals properly.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have found that some (not all!) HDTVs understand 240p when it is received through component. A simple chroma decoder to convert the signal directly to component would work very well in this situation, and be less of a gamble than an upscaler that may not support 240p at all.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my TV shows a small on-screen display every time the component signal switches between 240p and 480i, which would be rather distracting during some N64 games. I need an upscaler that not only understands 240p, but is capable of seamlessly switching between 240p and 480i. I really don't want to buy one if I can't try it first.

I assume this will skip all the unnecessary processing so that the image can be delivered faster. I'll check later tonight if this setting affects the analog inputs and whether that helps at all.

The screen is extremely horrible, so TVs have lots of weird filters to attempt to hide those issues. The problem is that those filters introduce lag (which as you can imagine is a problem with games), so TVs have a &quot;game mode&quot; that disables those filters in favor of reducing the lag to the minimum possible. As you can imagine it's expected to look much worse than usual.<br /><br />PC monitors usually feature better quality LCD screens so you don't see those issues on computers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />But then PC monitors tend to lack SD inputs at all. Some of those filters are needed to hide the limits of SD inputs. I've noticed that when I run a PC's VGA out to my Vizio LCD TV's VGA in, I don't get near as much lag or filter artifacting.<br /><br />In addition, PC monitors are sized for one person on a desk, not two to four people in a living room, so they're a bit harder to use with offline multiplayer games. Good luck with your Four Score. On the other hand, 1080p monitors for desktop PCs are already as tall as the 48 cm (19 inch)-diagonal 4:3 CRT SDTVs that used to be common as secondary bedroom TVs.
