		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, the whole project is as follows:
<br />  I was moded my old NES (Nintendo). I took the case and fit a PC in to it. What I want to do is be able to connect the cartridge reader to the computer and let it read the game and create a separate program to play the game. The main issue I am having is how the heck to connect the 72pin reader to the computer and reading it! So I thought if I can make it like a USB by plug and play and make a separate program to read it.
<br />IF ANYONE HAS ANY IDEAS PLEASE I REALLY NEED HELP!!
<br />THANKX

<br />Unfortunately, there is no ready-made reader for NES Game Paks. There is <a href="http://www.retrode.org/" class="postlink">one for Super NES, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance</a>, but not for NES. And even then, it won't work on obscure Chinese games that use a different bank switching method from the common ones.

<br />If there is a board small enough for your PC, that could fit inside the NES case with an NES+connector+CopyNES, but I guess that would not be easy.

A Retrode adapter board designed for common NES mappers would probably plug into the Genesis port, with both PRG and CHR address connected to Genesis address, CHR D0-D7 connected to Genesis D8-D15, and PRG D0-D7 connected to Genesis D0-D7.

<br />Basic knowledge of hardware i guess i can start there!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  can you direct me as to a site or more information were i can start off??
<br />I looked into the CopyNES but he states on his site that it is not ment for play back!
<br />Thankx

<br />
<br />I don't know any sites in particular, look up address decoding, figure out how parallel memories like EPROM and SRAM work, how the 6502 address and data bus work (PPU is similar but separate), then you would have to wire something up to read it all.  But it won't work with much, until you read up on every kind of mapper and board type and add support for it.  And you need software to do the reading.
<br />
<br />I guess the Retrode has a microcontroller in it, which would be pretty good for this.  In that case you need to know the programming language the microcontroller uses (and all the needed hardware it has).  You also need a way to interface it to the PC.
<br />
<br />I guess if you consider the EPROM / CPU stuff basic (I think it is), then there isn't much hardware knowledge needed.  But there's a decent amount of software (and/or firmware) involved.
<br />
<br />Using CopyNES would just be a lot easier.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ya i see what you mean the if i was to use the copyNES how does the software part of it work?? I had an idea because i saw that Retrode only copies from the cartridge and to the cartridge. Maybe i could create a program that will do the copy automatically and automatically start an emulator then before the the game closes it will load back in to the cartridge is that possible with the copyNES??
