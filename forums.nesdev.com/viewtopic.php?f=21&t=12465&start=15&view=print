For example, the light brown is extremely yellow and it makes making beach sand impossible. It's also near impossible to make a &quot;dollar bill&quot; green, because there is no middle ground between extremely green and grey. The commodore 64 color palette is only 16 entries long, and although it is duller than the NES's, I've seen pictures where they were able to smoothly transition colors and use a color around different colors to give the impression that there are more colors total than there really are.

I thought it had been said that you had pretty much infinite tiles to use on the NES if you had a mapper that could supply it. In fact, I thought I remember someone saying you could have a different palette for every 8x1 pixel area, even though I didn't bother because that seems pretty hard to work with.

In addition to 8x8-pixel attribute areas, it allows access to 16384 (i.e. 256KB) tiles at once.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In fact, I thought I remember someone saying you could have a different palette for every 8x1 pixel area, even though I didn't bother because that seems pretty hard to work with.</div><br />It's technically possible, but AFAIK nobody ever implemented this feature in an actual mapper. It has been proven to work on real hardware, but those were just tests.

(So much for &quot;Super&quot;. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> ) The way I thought of Metal Slug was because both the Neo Geo and the NES both use chr rom instead of vram. Didn't someone say using vram is less expensive than using chr rom, because I don't see how. If it is, why did Nintendo decide to go the cheaper route when they made the SNES, seeing that they didn't with the NES? I just thought that if memory was so expensive back then, than they would have actually saved money if they didn't have any vram and just had a bus that went from the cartridge to the PPUs or something.

On the other hand, the original plan was for every Super NES to to include a DSP-1, but that was cut. And when Sega tried a console upgrade that &quot;only has to be paid for once&quot;, the 32X went over like 99 lead balloons. </li><li>Wider edge connectors need tighter (more expensive) tolerances. </li><li>Even with CHR ROM, it would still need ~16K of RAM for the mode 7 nametable. And by the time you have that much RAM in the bill of materials, you might as well make it a RAM-based system. </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Good points. I still find it strange Nintendo went all the way with the NES and not the SNES, but I guess it has to do partially with, like you said, the Mode 7 nametable. I always thought that vram was the thing that brought the SNES back the most, especially compared to something like the Neo Geo. As previously discussed, I don't think the Neo Geo laps the SNES on anything really, except for maybe the animation. Donkey Kong Country has very smooth animation, but it doesn't animate objects that are half as large as the screen...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Memory prices change very quickly, so I bet Nintendo was counting on that when they designed the NES the way they did. Including more RAM on the system would have significantly increased its price back when it was designed, but a couple of years later they'd release games with not only large PRG and CHR ROMs, but also 8KB of RAM, which was way more than there was inside the console itself. For some reason, this reasoning didn't work with the SNES.<br /><br />The NES can still be wired from the cartridge to use its internal VRAM for tiles (making it possible for carts to only contain a PRG-ROM and a CIC, no CHR), but since there are only 2KB of VRAM, and 1KB has to be used for name and attribute tables, you end up with only 64 tiles for everything. If you reduce the screen size a bit you might be able to steal some of the NT/AT RAM for extra tiles. I still think this would make a good theme for a coding compo.

If all four palettes are the same, you can reuse the memory normally used for the attribute table to make up extra tiles instead. Sprites can still use different colors though.

Frankly, the SNES (and many other consoles from the time period) have neither. 64KB is okay for just displaying a picture, but if you want to animate that picture, you are going to run into trouble... I'm pretty sure I haven't seen anything like this on the SNES, not because the video hardware couldn't display it, (BG 3 is still a pain) it's because it couldn't really be animated. Off course, complaining about 20+ year old hardware doesn't do any good...<br /><img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/metalslug/images/3/35/Doragonnosuke.gif/revision/latest?cb=20090112193501" alt="Image" />
