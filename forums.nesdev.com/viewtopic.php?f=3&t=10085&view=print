		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just to make sure I've gotten this right:<br /><br />Is the DMC channel <em>always</em> just outputting whatever value the counter has, regardless of whether the enabled flag is set or not? If so, does that mean that games that play samples might need to initialize the counter with a write to $4011 first, so that the deltas are relative to the right counter value? (I'm assuming writing $4011 directly sets the same counter that's updated by the deltas.)<br /><br />If the above is correct, would it be accurate to say that the only function of the enable flag for the DMC channel is to control whether the automatic delta-encoded-sample-playing logic is currently active?<br /><br />I'm also a bit hazy on what different ways there are to get delta-encoded samples playing again after the end of a sample has been reached. What particular register writes will kick it off?<br /><br />Oh, and are $4011 writes and deltas from delta-encoded samples the only things that can update the counter?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks!<br /><br />Is the internal bytes remaining counter initialized from $4013 (sample length) only when writing to $4015 (status) with the DMC bit set while the number of remaining bytes is 0? That would mean that changes to $4013 while a sample is playing have no effect on the playback, while I'm guessing that changes to the sample address while a sample is playing <em>do</em> have an effect.<br /><br />Edit: Oh, wait, just noticed that the start address and current address are separate. Is the correct version that neither writes to $4012 (sample address) nor to $4013 (sample length) while a sample is playing have any effect (other than setting up state for the next sample)?<br /><br />I wonder if the &quot;silence flag&quot; is just the enabled flag by the way. In <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/chipimages/visual2a03/nodenames.js">http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/chipimages/v ... denames.js</a><!-- m --> you have<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">// enabled (write $4015), active (read $4015)<br />// these are actually the same register<br />pcm_en:14060,<br />pcm_on:14060,</div><br /><br />Would a model where the enabled flag is cleared whenever zero bytes remain in the sample be consistent with observed behavior? In such a model, you would have e.g. &quot;if enable bit goes from clear to set, load sample length into internal bytes remaining counter (edit: and sample start address into the internal current-address register)&quot;.

Further, the model doesn't even need a flag as state and could derive it from the counter being zero or not.<br /><br />Not sure whether you're writing an emulator, but a good way to test these questions is to implement them and run the test ROM. If you fail, the model is clearly wrong. If you pass, it might be correct. I've tried to anticipate misinterpretations of the descriptions and catch them in the tests.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes; that's something I exploited for making samples with a looped part: load $4012 and $4013 with begin and length of sample, restart playback with loop on, load immediatly $4012 and $4013 with start and length of loop point. When the first part is played the loop part goes on. Tested on a NES with a Powerpak and it works reliably.

I'm trying to determine whether there are two or three start addresses and two or three lengths in the APU.</div><br /><br />At a high level, it works something like this:<br /><br />You have an enable flag, a start address reg and a start length reg (set directly via $4010-4013 and $4015), as well as a current address reg and a remaining bytes reg (internal regs).<br /><br />A sample is &quot;started&quot; in one of two ways: (1) by writing $4015 with the DMC enable bit set when the remaining bytes reg is 0, or (2) by the loop flag being set when the remaining bytes reg reaches 0 during playback.<br /><br />Whenever a sample is &quot;started&quot; in one of the two ways above, the internal current address and remaining bytes regs are initialized from the start address and start length regs, and sample playback starts.<br /><br />Lots of details missing of course, but the point is that there only seems to be a single set of internal regs (in Visual 2A03 as well).<br /><br />Edit: I can't get the bit counter and PCM data reg to change in Visual 2A03, even though the rdy and pcm_irq lines change as expected and a short period is used. I wonder if that's a bug...

Is this related to the note below from <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU_DMC" class="postlink">the DMC article</a>?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The DMC's timing is completely separate from the video (obviously, it being an audio component). The DMC's timer is always running, and samples can only start every 8 clocks. However, because the DMC's timer isn't synchronized to the PPU in any way, these 8-clock boundaries occur on different scanlines each frame.<br /><br />To achieve stable timing, this is what you do:<br /><br />* At a fixed time in rendering (we'll use the start of vblank as an example), start a dummy single-byte sample at rate $F. Due to a hardware quirk, the sample needs to be started three times in a row like this: <br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&nbsp;sei<br />&nbsp;lda #$10 <br />&nbsp;sta $4015 <br />&nbsp;sta $4015 <br />&nbsp;sta $4015 <br />&nbsp;cli<br /></div><br /></div>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, I see what's going on in sync_dmc_fast now. The first write to $4015 immediately loads the final sample byte (since there's only one and the DPCM is drained). The second write to $4015 then starts a new sample before the old one has finished, meaning its final sample byte will be loaded at the next DMC clock after the old sample finishes. That makes it possible to sync on the DMC clock.<br /><br />Still not sure why you couldn't use a sample of length 2 instead, but maybe if I sleep on it...
