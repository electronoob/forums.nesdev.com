Also, the documentation doesn't seems to mention to activate the switch (although I figured it out).<br /><br />But, it is good game.

This inconsistency is the most annoying thing about the menus IMO. I agree that the best would be to have them all accept both A and START.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some games accept only Start to submit the title screen because historically, arcade games had separate start buttons. <br /><br />Some games do different things for A and Start. Tetris for Game Boy and NES, for example, has A to switch among controls in a form and Start to submit the form. They differ in what they do when A is pressed on the last control: NES wraps around to the first control, while Game Boy submits.<br /><br />In cut scenes, Thwaite uses A to go to next screen and Start to skip. In Practice mode, it uses a point-and-click model where A activates the item under the cursor, Start begins a game, and A also begins a game if the cursor is on <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">&#40;Play&#41;</tt>.<br /><br />Other games involve A in a command to be entered on the title screen. Super Mario Bros. lets the player hold A + Start to start from the previous world. Contra lets the player press ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A to add lives, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II has its own extend code that <em>Nintendo Power</em> infamously flubbed up when it was first printed.

Another possible thing is that on some menus you might make SELECT to move the cursor (if moved past the bottom, it move back to the top) like many NES/Famicom games does. I also think there are too many menus before the game will start (the menu that says nothing except &quot;PRESS START&quot; isn't needed).<br /><br />Another thing you could do if you want is provide Game Genie codes for skipping the language selection menu.<br /><br />I do like this game and think is good game, though.

I would be a little strange...</div><br /><br />Just make them do both. Only reason not to have A and Start be the same button (Since I is for advancing through 90% of menus.) would be where you need both. I mean, when start is the only button to press, why not have A work too? If the first button I pressed when it said &quot;Press Start&quot; since I usually finish menus and exit/start the game again by pressing A. But also, the select to move the cursor on menus, 100% agreed. It's what I tried at first too, just didn't think it was as big of a design flaw. But yeah, it took me a while to figure out if my controls were set up right because I pressed what works for most games and the menus are all different, so it was always a different key, so I thought my emu was broken, as it was the first game I tested with it. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
