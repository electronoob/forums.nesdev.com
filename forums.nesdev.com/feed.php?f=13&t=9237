You got it backwards - hinting is aligning all the glyphs to the pixel grid like your screenshot shows, whereas my screenshot is unhinted, and of course your text is aliased, as the &quot;blurriness&quot; some people see is caused by <strong>anti</strong>aliasing (which is the technique of adding grayscale pixels or using subpixel rendering to smooth out the font). You wouldn't want unhinted aliased rendering, as it <a href="http://www.freetype.org/autohinting/hinter.html" class="postlink">tends to look like ass</a> (scroll down to the images and ignore the fact that the hinted aliased ones look like ass, they're from an old version of freetype).<br /><br />Windows always renders hinted fonts without third-party software, even with ClearType turned on. The only time it renders unhinted fonts is when a font is being used that doesn't contain any hints (which sometimes happens with Web typography but all of the base system fonts used on Windows are hinted).<br /><br />I will recommend that, in the future when high-DPI displays are commonplace, that you consider rethinking your stance on the matter, as unhinted antialiased fonts on a high-DPI display (like the iPod touch 4/iPhone 4/iPad 3/Retina Macbook Pro) are just as easy on the eyes as reading printed paper, and don't exhibit any blurriness at all. That being said, I won't try any further to change your stance on the issue as both schools of thought are valid (and in fact, I do sometimes have a soft spot for the fonts as you see them, takes me back to my early Windows days running 95/98, as I stuck with the Amiga until 1995 which didn't have any sort of hinting or antialiasing on outline fonts, and primarily used bitmap fonts which were hand-tuned per pixel).<br /><br />I see the change with the 0x08-level increase. I'm happy with the result (and I checked the result in IE just to see how it would look for a large portion of the members, and it doesn't seem too bright to be a bother in my opinion).

Actually I don't use hinted/aliased or ClearType anything -- I run Windows XP and I turn all of that crap off.  I <strong>hate</strong> the way it looks.  I prefer &quot;pixel-esque&quot; fonts.<br /><br />Sure, lemme increase it by another 8 RGB values and see what we get.

If you're not familiar with it, gdipp is a set of services (both 32-bit and 64-bit) that replaces the standard Windows GDI font rendering with unhinted (and thus subpixel antialiased) rendering. I find it much easier to read than Microsoft's method of hammering type to the pixel grid, and much more like reading printed type. I actually used to have occasional headaches which I felt were related to hinted rendering, and those have pretty much gone away since I installed gdipp. I will say, I don't recall having any issues like this before the move (although I can't remember exactly when I installed gdipp but I'm pretty sure it was when the forum was still on Parodius).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=325">LocalH</a> — Tue Aug 21, 2012 6:37 pm</p><hr />

Interesting.  It seems to be a combination of colour profile (this would be in your system and/or video drivers), as well as use of ClearType or equivalent (which I do not use (I absolutely hate it, it makes everything look like blurry shit)).<br /><br />EDIT: It seems the forum software is re-encoding the PNG (or something?!  The background became BLUE!) I uploaded so the colours + depth get completely lost and it looks like total crap.  So I've put the actual PNG up on my server instead.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://jdc.koitsu.org/lj/riced.png">http://jdc.koitsu.org/lj/riced.png</a><!-- m --><br /><br />EDIT: Okay, nevermind.  It seems Firefox is completely fucking up the display of that PNG; it looks fine in Windows when viewed with Windows Image Viewer and so on.  Awesome.  Just totally completely awesome.  Thanks, Fireshit!  So download the PNG and view it locally instead.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">koitsu</a> — Tue Aug 21, 2012 5:39 pm</p><hr />

It would be easier if you could just provide a screenshot.  I totally believe you that quoted text may need to be brightened a bit (no argument there!), but a screenshot would give folks a better idea.

Running on Opera x64 12.01 SPDY (but also tested in Firefox Nightly x64 17.0a1 from 08-18-2012, Safari Windows 5.1.7 [7534.57.2], Google Chrome 21.0.1180.81 beta-m, and Internet Explorer x64 9.0.8112.16421, although the latter three exhibit no real problem) I have trouble reading quoted text, as it looks really dark upon the background color being used. I should disclose that I'm running gdipp on my system as I despise hinted font rendering and find the unhinted gdipp rendering to be much easier to read (hence why I run Opera as my main browser, as Safari's rendering of light-on-dark text is a bit too bold for my tastes, and letter spacing in Firefox, even when forced to use system rendering and thus use gdipp-rendered fonts is sub-optimal). I do wonder if those running on Mac OS X may have similar issues, as I understand font rendering to be much better than the Windows version of Safari when using anything but &quot;Windows Standard&quot; rendering. My girlfriend has a Macbook so perhaps next time I see her I could check to see how it renders on her system in various browsers.<br /><br />Since the quotes are clearly delimited by the box around the quote, I would ask that the quoted text be brightened a little bit, possibly even to the same level as unquoted text. The fact that I run gdipp may make me a special case, but I find it really hard to read quoted text. I can provide a screenshot if necessary.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=325">LocalH</a> — Mon Aug 20, 2012 1:12 am</p><hr />
