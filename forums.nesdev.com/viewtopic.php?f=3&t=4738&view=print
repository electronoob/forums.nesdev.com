		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have a question regarding VRAM address changes in the dummy scanline (scanline 20 zero indexed) that I would greatly appreciate a definitive answer to: Does the VRAM address increment vertically in the dummy scanline prior to the fetches for the first two tiles in the first drawn scanline and, if so, when does it do it?
<br />
<br />Brad Taylor's 2C02 technical reference states clearly enough: <div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">"Both horizontal *and* vertical scroll counters are updated (presumably) at cc offset 256 in this scanline."</div>
<br />That is consistent with my observation of games such as Golf that seem to set the VRAM address to 0x73E0 before the dummy scanline presumably such that it will roll over to 0x0000 when the fine vertical scroll bits are incremented.
<br />
<br />However, that seems to conflict with statements on the boards and the highly informative nesDev wiki that the temporary VRAM address is copied to the real VRAM address at clock cycle 304 of said scanline.
<br />
<br />As an aside, I've been trolling the boards for the past 6 months while piecing together my Mac OS X native NES emulator. I've got nearly every Mapper 0 game working now with little glitches here and there. It's my hope that I can be as helpful to others on this board as your comments have been to me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />At cycle 251, the scroll increments.  At cycle 304, T is copied to V, so the previous scroll increment gets overwritten.  So both happen, and only the one that happens second matters.  Unless you do crazy stuff, like turn off the screen between 251 and 304.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for the quick response. That certainly seems in line with PPU behavior in other cases. Unfortunately, it also eliminates an easy explanation for the garbage first scanline I'm seeing in some games (e.g. Clu Clu Land). I was hoping that perhaps the temporary VRAM address got a vertical increment on cycle 256 before being transfered to the real VRAM registers on 304.
<br />
<br />Looks like I've got some debugging to do. Thanks again for clearing things up.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I determined the cause of my garbage first scanline in Clu Clu Land after a few more hours of debugging. I'm using 0xBFF to mask name/attribute table addresses when Horizontal Mirroring is used.  The two physical nametables are therefore mapped to offsets 0 and 2048 in my name/attribute tables array. My attribute byte fetching logic was foolishly assuming that nametables were in contiguous memory, with the result I was accessing uninitialized memory when getting attribute bytes for Nametable #2 with Horizontal Mirroring.
<br />
<br />Games setting the VRAM address to 0x73E0 at the end of VBLANK were, understandably, using garbage upper color bits in the first drawn scanline. Clu Clu Land draws its first scanline correctly with the patch. Golf still shows junk in the first scanline but that junk matches Nestopia's so I'm guessing I'm fine there.
<br />
<br />The patch also fixed the corruption seen in games such as Xevious that use Horiztonal Mirroring and begin rendering from physical nametable #2. Given how bad that was, I really should've caught this earlier.
<br />
<br />All that said, I'm glad my VRAM address increment timing is sound ;)
