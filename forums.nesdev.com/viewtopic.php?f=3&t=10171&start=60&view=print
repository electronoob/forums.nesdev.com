I tested with Galaxian, and see 3.7 halflives per 1/60th of a second, or a halflife of 4.5ms. This means that the correct constant (with this TV) for the expression I gave above is k=1/13. This is low enough that on the NES, the effect will only ever be visible when transitioning to black pixels. So here's an animated gif, simulating same:<div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent"><!-- ia0 -->anim.gif<!-- ia0 --></div>It's <em>really</em> subtle, especially without any of the phosphor size blur.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sure, exponential curve. In a dark room, with a almost-entirely dark CRT, a human eye can see light over something like 10 factors of ten difference in brightness (not simultaneously. Just &quot;dimmest possible&quot; to &quot;brightest possible without being painful&quot;). But we've only got 2-3 factors of ten on a standard monitor, so that's not going to be visible unless you're willing to horrifically overexpose any visible pixels. (log₂(10¹⁰) ≈33; we'd need 96-bit displays to represent this.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I think a bloom effect emphasizes the wrong thing, though. You're trying to capture the fading trail of motion. The &quot;overexposed&quot; part is the non-moving image which should be bright and clean and clear, not fuzzed up with a bloom filter.<br /><br />The simulation of &quot;HDR&quot; in LDR space with bloom is for a very different purpose. This is trying to communicate that bright lights like the sun are &quot;brighter&quot; than the area the shape covers on the image by bleeding it out. This can correspond to some light scattering effects by particles in the atmosphere (e.g. fog), focal depth effects, or lens defects, which is why it gets that feeling across in the simulation, but it's not an actual representation of a high dynamic range, and the same physical effects that are being represented don't really apply here?

The last range between 10<sup>-4</sup> and 10<sup>-5</sup> is values of 1,2,3 out of 255 in sRGB.<br /><br />The difference between 4/255 and 5/255 in gamma 2.2 converted to linear light is a factor of 2, a whole photographic &quot;stop&quot;
