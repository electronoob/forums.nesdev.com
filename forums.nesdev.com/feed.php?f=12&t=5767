You could run it on the SNES powerpak, but it'd be as slow as crap.You use the ROM to buffer and just read it from the flash card.

For reference, NTSC aspect correction is roughly 1.148936:1. Varies per TV and all that.

Great glad you like it.  And thanks MottZilla I was thinking the ROM would be immediately shunned because of the whole 64MB deal, but realistically there'd be no way to show off the quality of video/audio the SNES can push without giving it a better mapper.  You can't push the SNES with this by sticking to the original 4MB limit or whatever.  I'm still thinking about the mode7 video ROMs, because that's the only thing that could ever get into a cartridge homebrew but it really does seem like a dead end.  128x64 was barely watchable and the size was awful.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Fri Dec 04, 2009 5:05 am</p><hr />

Honestly, this is more than good enough. In fact I think it's perfect. 64MB, full video, with the cool little GameArts accreditation intro, perfect audio syncup, and no errors. Video quality is great, too. No sense bugging you and others further with other sources and encodings and recompression and uploading and all that.<br /><br />I'm happy to say this is perfect. Thank you so very much for making it, it really means a lot to have this :D<br /><br />If you'll give me until the weekend, I'll get this mirrored to tukuyomi's FTP when I get a chance and free up your disk space.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Thu Dec 03, 2009 12:41 am</p><hr />

If anyone still cares, the 64MB compressed ROM based on the previous one is here.  7zip shaved off an additonal 1.8MB or so, 700KB of which was padding (since I like round powers of two on roms and all that).  byuu I don't know if you wanted it with or without the gamearts intro, just let me know and later I'll upload another without it.  If there is another video presented for this I'll remake it using that too.  The code is pretty much done, swapping audio or video in/out is easy.  I think the palettes were anti-compressed, I saw 519 byte outputs for a full palette but it's no big deal.<br /><br /><a href="http://smkdan.eludevisibility.org/videos/vid15_2.7z" class="postlink">http://smkdan.eludevisibility.org/videos/vid15_2.7z</a><br /><br />It'll be done uploading within 10 or so minutes at time of posting<br /><br />I removed the other sizable videos since I don't want to really intrude on Matthew's disk space..<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Wed Dec 02, 2009 11:32 pm</p><hr />

If there's any need to video editing, I'm not the one to be doing it!<br /><br />Compression support went no where, the original plan fell flat because after actually studying the bsnes source it does not advance any sort of internal pointer when reading between writes to 420B or whatever.  Atleast, it seems to look at the size parameter and decompress a big block, then feed the processor byte by byte until size is exhausted.  Then it resets the appropriate bit in $4801.  This is based on addr and addr isn't changing between stores to $420B so the emulator showed the same block of graphics repeatedly, only changing when banks were swtiched or the $4302-$4304 part was changed.  The palette was also attempted to be made out of the same tile data.<br /><br />Then I'll just go with the plan of compressing each 'sub block' of data.   A compressed block of data for every frame chunk, or every transfer involved in getting a frame uploaded.  4 for vram, 1 for cgram.  I'd have a working compressed ROM but the compressor causes access violations when I give it a 12800 byte file, the primary size I use everywhere.  The same compressor had no problem with 532KB (or larger) files, no problem with 200 byte files, but 12800 kills it.  I'll try to figure this out tomorrow.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3295">smkd</a> — Wed Dec 02, 2009 7:20 am</p><hr />
