<br />
<br />I'm really sorry to hear that. I send packages to Brazil all the time, and dealing with customs is such a hassle. Sometimes they check the packages, and sometimes they don't. I usually include a faked eBay printout with prices to try to trick them, and it has worked so far... and it is a shame that I have to lie to try to get a fair price, because the amount they charge is usually based on what they *think* something is worth, not the actual value.

I really wonder if it makes any difference for bunnyboy to declare the price as 50 bucks or if it's just funny to see people paying 160% of a price that already wasn't very attractive to begin with. Not complaining about the original price, it's expensive but I was up to it, it's just that in the end I'm paying just too much. I'm sorry if it does make a difference to you man, but this has been a pain for me.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">the amount they charge is usually based on what they *think* something is worth, not the actual value.</div><br />So very true.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Is Brazil a extremist dictatorial gouvernement or something ?</div>
<br />Not at all, we just have this crazy 60% import tax... It really sucks!

<br />Is there also an import tax on the value of licenses to produce products? Could you license PowerPak from bunnyboy, have it "MADE IN BRAZIL", and sell it to other Brazilians? Or would it be too expensive to import the components?

<br />I guess this would be possible, but I don't own a company or anything! =) Even if I were to do it as an individual, I wouldn't know where to begin! =)
<br />
<br />I guess this is the reason we had better prices in videogame consoles back in the days of the 16-bit systems and until the Nintendo 64 I think... We had consoles manifactured here, so the prices were much better. Today's consoles and games are all imported, and a game that costs 50$ in the US easily costs about 125$ here. This is why everyone, no exception, has modded consoles and play only pirate games.

<br />Theres a couple reasons why that is a bad idea:
<br />
<br />Its illegal!  Forging the value is mail fraud, up to $10K in fines, $5K in civil payments, 5 years in jail, more penalties based on the difference in value.  I guess I would put a lower value if you set up an escrow with $500K in case I got caught  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Insurance is added for the value of the package.  Not possible to get more than the value back, so if something happens the difference is just gone.  The USPS should pay, I doubt the customer would agree to pay, so it falls on me.  
<br />
<br />Some countries require a receipt when picking up the package to show the paid value.  If I write $50 and the receipt says $135 then the customer pays fines above the customs tax.  Yes this did happen once, I accidently added wrong and had to refund double the difference to cover someones fines.  Definitely lost money on that sale...

<br />BunnyBoy has to be honest in this case or he could be in big trouble.
<br />
<br />Luckily Bunnyboy sends his products by USPS and mine slipped by without being noticed by Canada Customs.

For handling insurance, the item could be claimed one-of-a-kind or something that would be more costly to "replace" than it was to produce the original. Or hell, do the insuring yourself, which would probably be cheaper than the excessive customs fee would otherwise be.

<br />
<br />True but this is only useful for industries witch exist in these countries, when it come to categories witch can only be imported it just leads to criminal activity by making black markets more popular

<br />I guess you are right. But I still feel really bad that we have to pay outrageous prices for things that we just can't find for sale in our own country.
<br />
<br />Although I live here in Brazil, most of my interests are things from other countries. I simply hate brazillian television, so everything I watch is either from Japan or the US. Music for me is practically from Japan only. The internet has sure helped me there, but when it comes to actual physical goods I'm still screwed.
<br />
<br />I'm not much of a hardware guy, so I definitely can't do it. I'm sure there are a lot of people who can though... the MSX scene around here, for example, is pretty big, and the guys make new, interesting hardware all the time. Maybe the NES is just not as popular here to gather such a following.
