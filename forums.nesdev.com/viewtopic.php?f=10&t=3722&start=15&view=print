A person who dives into ASM directly sure can learn it and code programs that work, but they'll probably start with really messy code (because as long as it works - or seems to work, which is worse - everything is fine), and will take longer to mature as programmers.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />That is completely true. I started out with horribly sloppy code. However, I think that this time period from beginner to good programmer can be shortened, if the concepts are explained well. Someday, in the future, I'd like to finish my document for beginners, when I feel that I'm ready to. But I haven't even learned all there is to learn about the NES. I've learned pretty much all I need to know in order to make a game, it's up to me to come up with code that will fully function and do what it should. When it comes to hardware, that's where I really don't know what I'm talking about. The documents explain everything in a way that makes sense to someone who magically has knowledge of the technical terms. They are written in a very unwelcoming way that discourages some people from trying to learn about everything. I'd like to reword it all someday to make sense to the everyday individual.

<br />IIRC i took this a couple months ago and was pretty much lost after i finished.

Starting with the NES may not be the best idea. Not that it never happened before, we've had some people who got into programming with 6502 ASM.

<br />
<br />i've been studying C++ for about 8 years now but rarely practiced cause there was nothing interesting for me to do at the time. nowadays i fiddle around with blargg's sound libraries, VST SDK from steinberg and the JUCE application framework mainly(and a little bit of SDL)

You come into the world of programming with no idea of what is actually easy or hard, and once you master the 6502, you'll move on the other languages to find that it's actually pretty easy. If you learn what's hard first, everything else will appear easy. But if you learn what's easy first, everything else will appear difficult.<br /><br />EDIT: I was working on a tutorial a while back for this very reason.

<br />too late for me...

<br />
<br />i'll be waiting. i've been wanting to learn that hardware since middle school  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> 
<br />
<br />anyway, sorry for the late replies guys, internets been dropping in and out.
