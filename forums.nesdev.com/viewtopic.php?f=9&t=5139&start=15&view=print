		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />MediaWiki software already checks the gross validity: if gd can't read the image, it won't thumbnail.
<br />
<br />Or you might be talking about the technique where a file is valid as two different formats: a JPEG file with garbage after it is valid, but a zip file with garbage <em>before</em> it is valid. You might want to look into what (if anything) Commons does to block <strong>copy /b screenshot.jpg+roms.zip out.jpg</strong> and the like.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />We may have to decide the rule about letting user uploading contents.  For now, the main goal was to move the wiki to a stable server and it's done. Good thing it was done because right now the original site seems down completely. I think the original site didn't allow uploading picture too.
<br />
<br />I may have to find the time to learn more about media wiki. If we could add an approval process for images and the image (or supposed to be image) cannot be accessed by anyone, then in that case that remove the possibility of using the wiki as a hiding place for files.
<br />
<br />You may say that I may be too drastic but we have the responsibility to make the wiki safe.  And since the hosting is free, we have to be even more careful to not abuse Koitsu's good will.

<br />Think of it this way: What prevents the idiots from uuencoding child porn and posting it to a (text) page?

<br />
<br />The ironic part is that they are on the server, just I have no idea on how to add them if you don't use the upload feature of the wiki. So I'm trying to configure the upload function but it requires a few things to be taken care of before.
<br />
<br />It will be online soon hopefully.
