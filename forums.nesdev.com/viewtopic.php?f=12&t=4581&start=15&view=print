I just tend to blog like before before those blog post take me time and I prefer to code at the moment. I'm currently implementing the enemies display routines and I will soon attack the collision part.
<br />
<br />Anyway any major improvement will get a release, rom or rom + code.

<br />See ya all

<br />How famous ?
<br />
<br />I have been ultr@ productive lately and there's a great chance something ends up in SMDGPROG.TXT file I have in my MD dev directory...
<br />
<br />
<br />A complete SNES doc would be nice to read too, its always fun to read something about the <em>competitor</em> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

I didn't know he had the link (probably an old one).  I did a little work with him. I adapted Pucrunch asm decompresser to the C compiler he was using for PCE coding.

<br /> Haha, I dunno. Charles M. and I have talked about you quite a few times (good things <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ). I've seen people mention your name in efnet IRC channels and such. People seem to just know of you <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />
<br /> Lint: You're working on the C compiler for SNES? If so, didn't you post a while back over at RHDN about this? I'm curious if you're handling the Clib as 65816 ASM or if it's internal.
