Just a small addition to what was said about CHR memory:<br /><br />Most game consoles back then used internal RAM for storing tiles, but the NES doesn't have any internal RAM dedicated for that (although through recent discussion it was concluded that it should be possible to use 1KB of name table memory as pattern memory, for a total of 64 tiles). Instead, all accesses to pattern memory are routed to the cartridge, which gives the people that make cartridges the option to use ROM or RAM for that memory.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Raiden the Quick wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Just like ROM but instead RAM bankswitching.<br /></div><br />Exactly.

That's actually how the iNES header format works. If you make a NES ROM with 0 as the CHR ROM bank count, emulators will assume that the game has 8 kilobytes of CHR RAM. However, there has been talk that the iNES format is flawed, as games COULD have more than 8k of CHR RAM (I don't know if any mappers support this though). This might be a little difficult to understand, but basically that means it's just a RAM chip that's bigger than 8k so bankswitching can be performed to select different 8k sections to map to $0000-$1FFF. That way you can write to different 8k sections when the screen is completely shut off and just do an instant bankswitch to change graphical data immediately.<br /><br />But yes, if you're relying on the current iNES header format, "0 CHR ROM banks" means "8k of CHR RAM".<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Jun 05, 2009 11:50 pm</p><hr />

No, $0000-$1FFF of PPU memory isn't necessarily read only. Some games use CHR-<strong>RAM</strong> because the programmers thought it would be more beneficial to be able to write data directly to that memory region instead of having it all ROM. For example, some games have clouds and stuff move by shifting the graphical data within each tile manually instead of having it all pre-defined. But if you use CHR ROM, you can't write to $0000-$1FFF; it's all predefined, aka Read Only Memory.<br /><br />CHR-ROM gets mapped to $0000-$1FFF just like PRG-ROM. If you use an 8k RAM chip in place of CHR ROM (aka CHR-RAM), that data will be mapped to $0000-$1FFF at all times, and you can do writes to that chip to change graphical data. It just depends on whether or not you have a ROM or RAM chip.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=138">Celius</a> — Fri Jun 05, 2009 10:26 pm</p><hr />

Few more questions, if you don't mind (you've all been extremely helpful, thanks)<br /><br />Are the pattern tables ($0000 - $1FFF) read-only?<br /><br />Does the CHR-ROM get mapped or actually copied into $0000 - $1FFF (whether it's being loaded in from startup, or memory mapped, or whatever)?<br /><br />I guess I would initially think "no, the pattern tables are not read-only" since I read that you can write to them during execution.  I would also initially think "no, it's not being copied, it's being mapped".  However, how can you write to $0000 - $1FFF if the CHR-ROM banks are being mapped in and not copied?  Does it disable you from writing to that location (or at least..nothing will happen, as discussed above) if CHR-ROM banks are being mapped in?  Does it make the pattern tables read-only if CHR-ROM banks are being mapped in?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3924">Raiden the Quick</a> — Fri Jun 05, 2009 7:42 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Celius wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />The bankswitching question is a little harder to answer. Basically, depending on the mapper you write to certain registers specific to that mapper (for example, $8001 for MMC3) to switch banks. These registers are usually ROM addresses, but writing to those addresses does not affect the data at that address. I'm not exactly sure how to explain that one, but if you read documentation on MMC1 or something it will explain more.<br /></div><br /><br />I read some documentation and I now understand this.  Certain areas in memory, when written to, act as, instead of writing data like you'd think, a way to control the memory mapping chip (bank switching, method of switching, which bank(s), etc.).  Haha and ROM is read-only so it can't be written to anyway, so it makes sense that that was chosen as the method of control for some chips.<br /><br />Thanks again for both of your help.  It is pretty simple actually, just gotta learn the specifics of each chip (which is documented).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3924">Raiden the Quick</a> — Fri May 29, 2009 4:22 pm</p><hr />

And therefore I shouldn't be writing any JMPs to $05F0, in the RAM, or like $3000, in the I/O registers?<br /></div><br />As long as there is a program at the location the processor is trying to execute, it will succeed. Nothing stops the programmer from manually copying code to RAM and jumping to that code. This is usually done when modifiable logic is necessary.

Second of all, either way, how is it done??<br /></div><br />You'd know the answers to most of these questions if you knew more about computer architecture. When I first came here I had a lot of the same questions, but since then I learned a lot. i'll try to explain as quickly as I can:<br /><br />Memory chips (ROM and RAM) have bytes stored in them. In order to access the bytes in them, the computer (in this case, the NES) tells the chip the address it wants to read through the address bus (16 wires that form a 16-bit address). After a little while the chip puts in the data bus (8 wires) the value stored at that location. To write to RAM the computer puts the address and the data on their respective buses, and enables a "write" line, so that the RAM chip knows it's supposed to save a value rather than output one.<br /><br />Anyway, once you know that the address bus is just a group of 16 wires (or traces on a board, whatever) it's easy to understand how memory mapping works. If you understand binary numbers (if you don't you'll not get this) you'll understand that by looking at some of these wires/lines it's possible to know what address is being acced at a certain point in time.<br /><br />Why do you think the memory map is conveniently divided in half (the upper half is ROM, the bottom half has RAM and registers)? Look at the binary representation of the addresses:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Lower half:<br />$0000 = %0000000000000000<br />&#40;...&#41;<br />$7FFF = %0111111111111111<br /><br />Upper half:<br />$8000 = %1000000000000000<br />&#40;...&#41;<br />$FFFF = %1111111111111111</div><br />What is the difference you see between the two ranges? The highest bit, bit 15, indicates which half is being accessed (it's clear when accessing the lower half and set when accessing the upper half). The NES uses this bit to decide whether to access memory on the cart or it's own internal memory (RAM) and registers. This is why I told you nothing is "copied", the NES just makes sure the appropriate data is seen at each accessed location.<br /><br />Bankswitching is also related to addresses. Only 32KB of memory are reserved for PRG-ROM, because the NES sends 15 address lines to the cart. So, 32KB is all the NES will be seeing at any given moment. However, carts can have much larger ROMs, with more than 15 address lines. Since the chip has more address lines than are actually available to the cart, what do we put in those lines? Well, this is bankswitching. These carts will also have a chip to hold what should be put into those extra address lines. By manipulating those values as the program runs, it's possible to see different sections of the large chip.<br /><br />OK, tired of typing now. Gotta go.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Thu May 28, 2009 7:13 pm</p><hr />
