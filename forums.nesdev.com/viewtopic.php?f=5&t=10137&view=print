		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So if you haven't heard of the new super-duper fast wifi standard, there's 802.11ac.  Supposedly faster than 802.11g and 802.11n.  Promises up to 450mbps on the 2.4Ghz band, or 1300mbps on the 5Ghz band.<br />I finally got my hands on a USB wireless device and a router.<br /><br />The verdict:<br />7 MB/sec on 2.4Ghz<br />7-9 MB/sec on 5Ghz (although I was able to get 13.5 MB/sec on a different computer)<br /><br />So much for &quot;450mbps&quot; on 2.4Ghz or &quot;1300mbps&quot; on 5Ghz.<br /><br />Still much faster than the 2.5 MB/sec I was getting before on the so-called &quot;a/b/g/n&quot; card.  At least the &quot;54mbps&quot; promised by old standards has finally been delivered.

Don't complain about having to plug a cable into a device -- I don't want to hear it.  :-)<br /><br />If you're testing throughput using CIFS/SMB: don't.  The protocol is slow as molasses at numerous levels.  Use FTP.<br /><br />But in general all 802.11 protocols are shit.  Anything wireless is generally shit, for the record -- that applies universally to speed, reliability, all of the above.  The entire design is &quot;spew crap and hope it gets there&quot;.  No thanks, rather not.

HTTP at least reuses connections. Keep this in mind when you run speed tests. Also keep it in mind when you try to upload a big web application like MediaWiki to a shared web host; you want one with shell access because uploading the application as a tarball and extracting it on the server is a lot faster than opening a connection for each file.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tepples is worrying about something that isn't relevant to the discussion.  Do not let his words sway what I am telling you; please re-focus.<br /><br />For FTP throughput testing, you use a single large file for tests -- say, a 600MByte ISO image.  Socket creation time has virtually no impact on this kind of test.  <strong>You need to test across your LAN -- do not ever use an Internet-bound host for wifi throughput tests.  A proper test: wifi client (e.g. laptop) connecting via FTP to an Ethernet-connected server (e.g. desktop box).</strong><br /><br />Unrelated: both passive and active FTP mode are still used today.  Failure to support both results in problems -- and I cannot tell you how many times I have had to explain how the FTP protocol actually works (so many times on DSLR and linksysinfo.org!) to people setting up/configuring firewalls, because most people &quot;think&quot; they understand it but actually don't.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't use wifi because I don't want to run cables - my main desktop machine is tethered, as is my PS2. I do like Wifi for handheld devices and portability - my GF brings her laptop over here sometimes and it's nice to be able to let her use the internet without having to string Ethernet across the floor. Plus, I know some people here may not like Apple devices, but I'm quite fond of my jailbroken iPod touch and heavily use it with my wifi.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Since we're already off topic, I use wifi for a distance of ~12ft on my main desktop because there are doors on either wall between my modem and PC.  I love wireless so much even my internet access is wireless from our provider.  To be fair/honest I suppose it's more due to the fact I don't have much for internet provider options living in the sticks.  And I guess I'm lazy and easy to please, why route a cable if I don't have to.  Especially if the wifi isn't the limiting factor on my internet.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Like I said -- look into PowerLine adapters.  No &quot;wall tunnelling&quot; or &quot;routing of cables&quot; needed.  It works, and the throughput is (on most products -- not all, but most) as advertised.  It's also AES encrypted (and given how it works the encryption is important) -- but it's all 100% transparent to the system/OS/machine (as it should be).<br /><br />For handheld devices that absolutely warrant wifi, yep, you have no real choice in the matter.  The protocol and technology (wireless) still sucks and is extremely error-prone, however.  My approach is always: if you have the choice of using Ethernet, take it, else use PowerLine adapters; for handhelds you gotta use wifi, just nature of the beast.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've used adapters through the wall. There are conditions where they work well, and conditions where they don't, depending on what the power situation in your house is. They're worth a try, at least. I've had situations where their bandwidth is severely limited, or drops out for sustained periods due to other electrical usage in the house (e.g. A/C, vacuum cleaner, etc.), and I've had other situations where it worked reliably for a long time.<br /><br />I almost exclusively use wifi, because I very seldom find it lacking (there are 6 computers in this house using wifi daily, none wired). There are occasional signal drops, of course, but not frequently enough to be a problem. Maybe once a week one happens in the middle of a download and I need to resume/restart. Not a big deal, but it depends on your usage. Obviously there are lots of situations where wifi reliability is very poor, but it can also be very good. If you need a constant uninterrupted signal, though, there's no substitute for being plugged in.<br /><br />Large transfers (e.g. &gt;10GB) I generally just stick on a portable hard drive, but with the speeds dwedit's talking about for 802.11ac maybe I wouldn't even bother.
