		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Besides the $6000-$7FFF writing, another thing that the SmartCard doesn't like is writing to parts within the register's range. For example, it accepts $2000 just fine, but I remember certain games writing to for example $2134. It for some reason would crash. I think Gauntlet might have been one that acts as though it's a UNROM mapper and loads from and writes to a table to avoid bus conflicts. The SmartCard does not like this. So watch how it's writing the normal cartridge registers. If it's not plain standard, maybe that is the issue.

Pokemon Yellow<br />   i've tried many versions(Jap, US, Chinese trans) work on smartcard, but the save games corrupt, is there a fix to solve the problem?<br />2. Dai-2-Ji Super Robot Taisen G <br />   A famous SLG game on gb, i think it's sgb1 format, and i'm not sure to choose color or noncolor, this game failed to go into the first chapter battle, then crashed.<br />3. Snoopy Tennis<br />   This game can go to menu, but can not play a match<br /><br />I hope you have time to test these games, and able to teach me how to solve the problem, if you need the rom, get it from the attachment(don't know if it is legal here), if i need to do something just let me know, appreciate it. <br />thanks again for your hard work on smartcard flash card, i really love this. Have a nice day, sir <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br /><strong>[Nope. NESdev.com is not a commercial ROM site. --MOD]</strong>

Then right click to bring up the menu again but this time choose Other &gt; Debugger. In the new window goto Debug &gt; Access Breakpoints. <br /><br />In the box addr range, put 6000-7FFF. Click Add. Then goto Run and tell it to run the game. If it kicks back to the debugger, it means the game has written to the range 6000-7FFF. This will usually crash the game if running on the SmartCard.<br /><br />Snoopy Tennis writes to a non-standard address, 3A1A which the SmartCard doesn't like. I tried changing the writes, which then crashes the game. It may be a form of protection.<br /><br />Update: It does appear Snoopy Tennis writes to the non-standard address which for whatever reason SmartCard and likely other older flash cartridges don't like causing them to crash. You can't simply change these writes however because another part of the code is loading the data from the opcodes and using them. Changing it will cause a crash. It'll require more effort to fix than I have time to put into it. Maybe someone else will. Or maybe there is a crack out there already.<br /><br />About Pokemon Yellow, I'm not sure why there is a saving problem but I think I've heard of trouble with Pokemon before. Again, I don't have the time to invest in fixing it.<br /><br />Super Robot Wars writes $6000 on startup but other than that I didn't notice any issues. Patching out the write may get it working.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Pokemon games are probably reading the SRAM of the cartridge which does not match the real game. <br /><br />The Stadium games will likely check SRAM banks 0, 1, 2, and 3. On the SmartCard menu I made, these are the &quot;working&quot; banks. Your Pokemon save data is only located here temporarily. It is moved to higher banks the next time the menu is run. If the Pokemon game is the only game on the cartridge then it shouldn't be a big issue. If you have multiple games you need to be sure that the last game you played on a gameboy is the pokemon game before using it with Stadium. This would make sure your save data is in the lower banks.<br /><br />But does the Stadium game save data back to the cartridge? If it does then for the menu system to work you need to olad your pokemon game on a gameboy so the menu copies the save into the working banks but then do *not* reboot the gameboy. This will leave a flag marked so that the menu the next time it is run will copy from the working banks to the save banks. That means that when Stadium modifys the save data it will get saved the next time you play it on a gameboy. <br /><br />That's all I can really tell you because I don't know a whole lot about the Pokemon games and virtually nothing about the Stadium games.
