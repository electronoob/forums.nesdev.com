Well background objects could be represented by a 2-bit "state" system of some sort. Although in a free-scrolling engine that'd get more huge with the memory needed.

<div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Backtracking, destructibility, no PRG RAM: pick two.<br /></div><br /><br />I still think this is a really defeatist mantra.  There are all sorts of ways to achieve all three.<br /><br />"Backtracking" in the sense that you're using it must be clarified that you imply "backtracking throughout the entire level."  It's quite easy to design levels to have large vertical dropoffs partway through, or other various methods of one-way doors.<br /><br />You also have to clarify that by "destructibility" you mean "wholly persistent destructibility throughout the entire level."  Would people accept blocks respawning 5 screens behind them?  Why would that be a problem?  In Zelda dungeons the enemies stay dead for only a few screens, then the old rooms repopulate.  In a large number of games, enemies respawn off screen constantly.  Why not then do the same for destructible blocks?<br /><br />If your game is focused on blocks and their destructibility, it also shouldn't be a problem.  You won't need the RAM for other objects and enemies and can devote all of it to saving a level's worth of destruction.  Naturally you design the levels around the amount of destruction that could reasonably be saved.<br /><br />Is it completely impossible to do any compressing/decompressing on the fly as the player moves around?  This ought to be especially easy in "screen flipping" games like Battle Kid where a pause is expected at every room edge, but obviously this topic is for 8 way scrolling.  I still think it should be possible, though.<br /><br />Essentially, the statement should be "pick two <strong>unless you don't mind a slight headache, and who in NES development would?</strong>"<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Tue May 10, 2011 4:38 am</p><hr />

I just made an 8-way scrolling engine that uses vertical mirroring so it's limited to two screens wide with many screens vertically.  Right now it can decode tile chunks that are written to the row buffer every 8-pixels, followed by copying the buffer to the nametable.  The tile chunks only store flat surfaces and slopes where the objects will stand; it still needs a way to fill the space between the ground.  It will also support limited brick smashing.<br /><br />It also keeps a 128-byte copy of both attribute tables, which I'm not crazy about but it's the easiest way to overwrite only the palette that must be changed while keeping the other palettes in the same byte.  Reading back the attributes in vram will eat up more vblank time that can't be wasted, since I've got some ambitious split screen ideas in the works.<br /><br />With extra prg-ram, I don't see why free scrolling can't be done in vertical mirroring without artifacts (on ntsc) unless you need a status bar (So I can see why Mario 3 and Kirby stuck with horizontal mirroring and ate the artifacts).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3506">strat</a> — Mon May 09, 2011 9:11 pm</p><hr />

If you can expand the 60 byte RAM table, you could add slopes. One bit for solidity and two for 4 possible slope types. But I don't think I'll be dealing with slopes soon so it's probably a idea I'd personally like to explore and mess with.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4311">3gengames</a> — Mon May 09, 2011 3:38 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">tokumaru wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />In my honest opinion, the ONLY thing that complicates free scrolling is the fact that there are only 2 nametables. Once you decide how to handle that (there are 3 options: use 4-screen mirroring; hide the scrolling artifacts using various tricks; concentrate the artifacts in locations less likely to be noticed), it gets really simple.<br /></div><br /><br />I'm pretty sure this wasn't my problem. I made a system so I adress all metatile by a (row, column) system, and it gets converted to a VRAM adress with a loockup table. (Up to 32 columns and 15 rows are supported for vertical mirroring). I made a system that delays the row updates when scrolling vertically so it hides them in the overscan area, but you're right that this might the problem : The horizontal scrolling routine "ignores" this delays and assume the data here is already updated. If the user change his mind for example when scrolling down, and scrolls up again, the vertical scrolling routine will "cancel" the delayed update, but the horizontal scrolling routine will ignore that and still act as if the bottom row was updated. I'm not sure if this was my problem, but it was something in the like.<br /><br />I use $2007 reads for attribute tables in my (other) game project, so that I can modify only the top or bottom half of the 32x32 block by RMW operations.<br />For my (non-working) scrolling attempt I used a completely different system where it mirrors attribute tables in RAM, and again the table would only be adressed by (row, column) pointer and would be converted by a loockup table.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon May 09, 2011 1:37 pm</p><hr />

On that thought, has anyone ever explored expanding the built in ram to fill the entire 8k of space it responds to? Not just explored it hardware wise but also tried implementing it in an emulator and seeing if it breaks any existing games that might rely on mirroring. It seems like that might be relatively easy to do and it would give you a nice boost in memory.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Mon May 09, 2011 12:45 pm</p><hr />

In my honest opinion, the ONLY thing that complicates free scrolling is the fact that there are only 2 nametables. Once you decide how to handle that (there are 3 options: use 4-screen mirroring; hide the scrolling artifacts using various tricks; concentrate the artifacts in locations less likely to be noticed), it gets really simple.<br /><br />I always hide the scrolling artifacts, either by masking the top 16 scanlines or the leftmost and rightmost 8 columns. Once that's decided, you know where the seams will go ("under" the masked area).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon May 09, 2011 10:48 am</p><hr />
