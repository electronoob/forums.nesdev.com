		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The backgrounds never overlap, as far as I can tell anyway from looking at the game's tiles in Kawaks. From an artistic standpoint, it seems like it would be much easier, as you could just about forget about palettes and the 16x16 attribute grid. It'd probably be more difficult to implement though as well as eating more graphics bandwidth.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's also what the S-DD1 is for.<br /><br />The Neo Geo game is 193 Mbits, or a little over 24 MB.  Assuming the graphics are uncompressed and constitute the bulk of the data, that already seems like it should fit easily in the S-DD1's 16 MB of addressable ROM when compressed (remember, Star Ocean is literally twice as big without the compression), and there are a few extra MB of spare address space on the A bus that you can fill with ROM in parallel to the chip if you want.<br /><br />Not to mention that the Neo Geo's screen resolution is higher (leading to SNES graphics being slightly smaller for the same on-screen real estate; the conversion might be time-consuming, but the gameplay would be preserved) and the program was in all likelihood not optimized for size.  Also, aren't most of the Neo Geo's PCM channels fixed-rate with no looping?  You'd probably save some space on the audio side too, even assuming your audio driver is agile enough to stream everything through ARAM at full quality...  With luck and skill, the game might actually fit into 8 MB of physical ROM if you used an S-DD1.

There's 64 MiB of 4bpp packed-pixels data (decodes nicely at a width of 16px), and 512 KiB of S fix layer data (4bpp, 8px wide, probably bankswitched—part of it repeats every 128KiB)<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, aren't most of the Neo Geo's PCM channels fixed-rate?<br /></div>The data files include a raw 16 MiB ADPCM file (seems to decode mostly ok as plain IMA ADPCM); at 18kHz (exactly 1MHz÷54) this will last 30 minutes. The first 135 seconds are literally just every note from a piano; then 15 seconds of a three octaves of a synth lead, then a minute of an octave of a distorted guitar ... yeah. there's not only lots of room for optimizing this, but it'd be necessary to fit in the SPC700's RAM.

Not that I seriously expect Metal Slug 3 to fit in an S-DD1 cart without altering the pinout of the chip or adding a helper chip.  Theoretically I think it can address 256 MB, and I know for a fact that at least one 64 MB homebrew ROM exists, but physically it seems to be limited to 16 MB...<br /><br />I was referring to the original Metal Slug, which is 193 Mbit.  Metal Slug 2 (362 Mbit) might fit as well, but it looks much tighter...
