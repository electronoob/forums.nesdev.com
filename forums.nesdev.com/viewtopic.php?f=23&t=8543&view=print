<br />
<br />That is exactly what I was thinking.  When it came time for the SNES and Sega Genesis, developers got used to dealing with higher color palettes so you didn't see the weird colors and bad contrast you saw on mid to late 80s arcade games.

<br />Data East used to make some pretty ugly games in general (but they could still be fun to play). Except for Magical Drop III - which has pretty decent graphics - most of their games look like they hired children to draw their graphics. That's not to say that I can draw any better.. just that their graphics artists weren't any good.

<br />
<br />Magical Drop III was a pretty decent game for its time, and had some pretty good artists in my opinion. Then again, it wasn't that early of a game so I guess it doesn't apply to this thread <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
