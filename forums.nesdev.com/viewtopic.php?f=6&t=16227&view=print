But everything I've heard so far is not really what I'd imagine for my game.<br /><br />For example, the songs in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; are too penetrating for my taste if you know what I mean. Compare any of these songs, like overworld or village, to the song of level 1 of &quot;Castlevania&quot; (or the level just before Dracula where you walk over that bridge) and you might know what I mean with &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; being penetrating.<br /><br />So, which of these games have the best soundtrack?

It sometimes think it hurts my ears with its straight, shrill notes,  but at the same time something below makes me like it.<br /><br />Faxanadu has some cool tunes. The city music fits perfectly for the hometown being in disorder.<br /><br />Shadowgate is great. <br /><br />Iron Sword II, too. Especially theme 1 and shop music.  More focus on 'fantasy' than 'medieval' here. With medieval, i specifically mean 70s/80s fantastic ideas of medieval.  <br /><br />Of all these, i feel NTSC/PAL agnostic, but i feel solstice sits better in PAL.

But I don't really see it as fitting for the atmosphere of my game.<br /><br />By the way, my game's general atmosphere is similar to a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; game: Fantasy world with a good king, an evil overlord, magicians, monsters etc., but with the world generally being alright, i.e. the overlord hasn't come to power and hasn't devastated the land yet, so it's your task to make sure that this indeed doesn't happen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />An idea might be to study medieval instruments and what makes them tick, and how they were played. <br /><br />For instance, medieval flutes were wooden and had no flaps with which to make trills. You could still do trills by hand, but not as readily as a later-age philharmonic orchestra musician would. <br /><br />When playing the recorder, a medieval musician would sometimes play two recorders at once. One pipe plays a drone, and the other a melody. The artist would often shift the task of the two pipes, so that the one that played the melody now plays the drone. They have a common wind envelope (air pressure from the musicians' mouth), which should be reflected in volume and fine pitch. The two square channels are perfect for this job. Pictures, sound and a modernized replica of the instrument setup can be found here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.flute-a-bec.com/flute-doublegb.html">http://www.flute-a-bec.com/flute-doublegb.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Then, there were many treatices on how sacred music should be played. You could take inspiration from that.

I only used this as a reference point to make clear that it's not a setting like &quot;Crystalis&quot;, more &quot;Zelda&quot;/&quot;Final Fantasy&quot;/&quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;.<br /><br />Sound-wise, I'm looking more for stuff that sounds like Square's Super Nintendo RPGs (for example &quot;Final Fantasy - Mystic Quest&quot;). I'm not necessarily looking for stuff that you would connect to terms like minnesong or Sir Lancelot.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Still can't hurt to study what makes an instrument. I mean, what you seem to want to get away from is using instruments that just go beeep.  The way you'd do that is by knowing the properties of/examining the sort of physical instruments you want to synthesize. You composer can likely do that, and take something like the following as an instruction: &quot;Here's pieces of music that i feel are somewhere in the ballpark, if you can overlook some instruments - I'd like to stay clear of unnatural beeps/pc speaker-like sounds.&quot; You can then still study the composition of prior works without needing to take notes on the actual contour of sounds. Had different instruments been applied to the Swords and Serpents arrangement, it wouldn't have been so piercing. <br /><br />As for final fantasy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH3RSAT3Asc" class="postlink">8 bit music theory</a> is a youtube channel that has a few episodes that fall somewhat close to your OP query in that they analyze the moods of said and similar titles. That might help with some inspiration, perhaps.

The Kinslayer's solos just got pasted on my mind), Iron Maiden and Metallica have some nice solos, and even Evanessence and classical music. <br /><br />Good look with your new project!<br />Hope to see some teaser soon!

While she is capable of using FamiTracker and her first song sounds pretty neat, I assume she can still learn a lot about the techniques. So, a few songs that are done with the same limitation that she faces here will probably help. Otherwise, I could just send her the sound of &quot;Adventures of Mana&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy - Mystic Quest&quot; and be done with it. I will probably do this as well, but for this, I don't need help. For NES games, however, I do need help to find suitable tracks.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Fisher wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Good look with your new project!<br />Hope to see some teaser soon!</div><br />Thanks.<br />Any kind of teaser will probably take a while, though.<br />In the moment, I'm working on the engine with mere placeholder graphics. In the meantime, we do the story, the scripts and soon the sprites. Then we have to create the maps. So, there's still a lot to do.

They hit volume 7 for each new notes, but then they pull back to 4 or 5 for the sustain.<br /><br />If these are &quot;penetrating&quot;, you'll have to go with a lute/guitar lead.
