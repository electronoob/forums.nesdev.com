<br />A cartridge adapter for the Kevtendo could be an external device not unlike Retrode. I don't see how it would look any sillier than a Famicom with FDS attached, Sega Genesis with Sega CD, Super Famicom with Satellaview, or Nintendo 64 with 64DD. My HP OfficeJet printer is much bigger than my Mac mini computer. The Wii Balance Board is bigger than the Wii console. The Guitar Hero guitar controller and the Dance Dance Revolution controller are bigger than the PlayStation 2 console (slim version).

<br />
<br />Right. But as I said in "most markets" the Master System didn't do well at all. My point again being that they should have focused every last resource put into the system to focus on the 16bit new platform. The SNES may have suffered if it had NES support tacked on.

<br />Really? I wasn't aware so many games utilized the $6C opcode with a FF-xy operand. Is there a list somewhere I could peruse at my leisure?

<br />At which point he can point to copynes to point out that he in fact made a device so these roms can be legally transferred. Now stop overanalysing and enjoy the device when it comes out.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />SD card will definitely make this device really awesome. Also if Kevtris wants to add cartridge functionality I'm sure Retrode would be a good way to go. Matthias is always looking for more devs maybe the projects can help each other some how? Other wise he can just point out like most devices do that obtaining roms is something you need to do your self (via Copynes, kazzo, or Retrode) and just leave it at that.
<br />
<br />This maybe a stupid question but is there a thread where kevtris's progress on this device? Would love to order a couple when it's all ready.
