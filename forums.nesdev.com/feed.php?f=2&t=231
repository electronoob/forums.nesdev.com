But I also ask myself how would sound some effect that would use very short notes to make the channel enable, disable, enable, disable, etc... (chaning the state twice per frame) for special sound effects, while changing the pitch fastly. Also, making the channel randomly silenced at the segond half of a frame would be cool to make a "bubble" effect (creating some glitches in the sound and use them in a profitable way to do special tricks on music). Scince all theese effects are less than a frame long, it would be possible to rely on a value of $40 or $c0 that would be clocked before treating the triangle channel, scince the square channels would be treated before then the value for this is pretty stable (or am I wrong ?). Then, if there is nothing special on the square channels, nothing will be written to $4017 and this may cause audible differences.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />You could have the sound driver manually update the frequency every 1/60 second and use the sweep on a one-shot basis to change the frequency 1/120 second between updates.

Konami however used a lot the sweeps for the sound registers. I think both was good, but still the sweeps allows more precision for sound effects, and the thing will be the same as the triangle's linear counter for triggering it a segond time in the same frame. However, what about if a sound effect does this in the first treated square channel, and then the segond may have the 3 highest bits affected and modify the APU clock, so the sound effect would be highly affected. If all APU writes <em>exept the frequencey thing with $4017 trick </em>are buffered, this may be okay, isn't it ?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />As you describe, even if you arranged for the APU's frame IRQ to occur between the PPU's NMI, it would drift, and would get reset when you clocked the sweep by writing to $4017.

Even with only $55 samples, it would waste ROM and make a cute buzzy noise. With only $00 of $ff samples, after reseting it's DAC by writing, respectively, $00 or $7f to $4011 if would work fine, but still, PPU IRQ woud be better.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Mon Aug 29, 2005 9:04 am</p><hr />

Vibrato is always done in software by constantly varying the note's frequency; there is no direct hardware support for it. When this requires adjusting the high 3 bits of the square's timer period, the usual method will result in the phase being reset constantly. This isn't necessary on the triangle channel beacuse its phase is never reset, even when changing the high 3 bits of its timer period.<br /><br />Consider a square channel note with a period of $200. The music player's vibrato might set it to $200, $1FF, $200, $201, $200, $1FF etc. The music player must change the high 3 bits when going from $200 to $1FF and from $1FF to $200. This is the core problem.<br /><br />Assuming the square is already set up as follows,<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda  #$FF      ; low 8 bits<br />sta  $4002<br />lda  #$01      ; high 3 bits<br />sta  $4003<br /></div><br /><br />the usual way is to set the timer period normally,<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda  #$00      ; set low 8 bits<br />sta  $4002<br />lda  #$02      ; set high 3 bits<br />sta  $4003<br /></div><br /><br />while the method I describe uses the sweep:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda  #$87      ; sweep enabled, shift = 7 &#40;1/128&#41;<br />sta  $4001<br />lda  #$C0      ; clock sweep immediately<br />sta  $4017<br />               ; timer period is now $202 &#40;$1FF + &#40;$1FF &gt;&gt; 7&#41;&#41;<br />lda  #$00      ; set correct low 8 bits<br />sta  $4002<br /></div><br /><br />This special sequence is only necessary when the upper 3 bits of the timer period need to be changed without resetting the phase. When just the lower 8 bits need to be changed, they can be written directly.<br /><br />A full implementation of this technique needs to do a few more things than shown above. The sweep units must have the minimum period set at all times (write $0F into them when they aren't being used), and some extra things must be done when changing the timer period:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">               ; increment timer period's high 3 bits<br />lda  #$40      ; reset frame counter in case it was about to clock<br />sta  $4017<br />lda  #$FF      ; be sure low 8 bits of timer period are $FF<br />sta  $4002<br />lda  #$87      ; sweep enabled, shift = 7 &#40;1/128&#41;<br />sta  $4001<br />lda  #$C0      ; clock sweep immediately<br />sta  $4017<br />lda  #$0F      ; disable sweep<br />sta  $4001<br />lda  #$xx      ; set correct low 8 bits<br />sta  $4002<br /></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Mar 08, 2005 9:02 pm</p><hr />

Interesting. I didn't got it very well. You write a 7 to the sweep's unit depht, but this could change to change vibrato depht, isn't it ? You said it would clock the lenght counters ? I belived it would just fixes their speed between two possible speeds.<br />So this would allow the sweep to start imediately, so a higer/lower tune is in the frequencey register, right ? So we have to never write anythig at the freqencey register exept at a new note state, right ?<br />This method won't allow any vibratoes on the triangle channel, but I think writing to $400b doesn't reset the triangle step generator or something, I've never heard anything like that so this could be done softwarely.<br />For now the simplest way to do vibratoes witout gliches is to toggle the frequencey's LSB bit with an EOR #$01.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Tue Mar 08, 2005 1:36 pm</p><hr />

When the high 3 bits of the timer period of a square channel are changed by writing to $4003 or $4007, the waveform is restarted (phase is reset). This is fine if a new note is starting, but inconvenient if vibrato is being applied to one of the few notes which are near the timer periods of $100, $200, $300, $400, $500, $600, and $700.<br /><br />After writing the recent sweep test ROMs, I was realized that the sweep could be used to set the high 3 bits of the timer period without restarting the wave. The basic idea is to use the sweep with shift = 7 to increment or decrement the high 3 bits, then clock the sweep immediately by writing to $4017. A shift of 7 results in an offset of of 1 to 15, greater for higher timer periods. If the low 8 bits are set to $ff when adding, $00 when subtracting, the offset will reliably increment or decrement the high 3 bits as desired. Once the high 3 bits have been changed with the sweep, the low 8 bits can be set directly.<br /><br />I made a <a href="http://h1.ripway.com/blargg/temp/smooth_vibrato.zip" class="postlink">simple demo ROM</a> that plays a tone that slow rises and falls, with slight vibrato. The phase never gets reset, so it always sounds clean. This technique might be useful for sound engines. The only issue is that the extra clocking of the sweep would rule out the use of the length counters, linear counter, volume envelopes, and normal sweeps, since the frame counter is used in a non-standard way. This wouldn't be a problem in a modern music engine that implements its own versions of these features in software to allow more flexibility and control.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Tue Mar 08, 2005 4:12 am</p><hr />
