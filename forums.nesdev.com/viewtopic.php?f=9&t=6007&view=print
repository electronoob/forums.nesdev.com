The PowerPak works fine on my top-loading NES, but when I try it on the Fami AV, I get a gray screen with red squares.  Any help would be appreciated.

<br />
<br />Yeah, my next step was to get a new adapter, but unfortunately, the only non-Yobo one I can find is $40.

<br />It works well, but not perfectly.  Games that map their own VRAM will not work properly because two pins are tied together on the converter as they are on 98% of commercial cartridges.  They must be separated for the 2% (Gauntlet, Rad Racer II, After Burner, all MMC5 games) to work properly.  With alot of scraping and some soldering, I was able to get these games to work properly with real cartridges but apparently destroyed its ability to work with the PowerPak.  Now it displays severe graphical glitches from menu to game.  
<br />
<br />The family converter, as seen here, will work perfectly with all commercial cartridges, including all games listed above.  They will also work with the ROMs which work with the PowerPak (no MMC5).

<br />Does the Family Converter play MMC5 games, or is the same deal as the others?

<br />Yes, but only on real cartridges (above post edited).

<br />
<br />Where did you get the Non-Yobo "$40" adapter? I've been looking for one that is known to be compatible with the PowerPak on the Famicom...
<br />
<br />Link please?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I use an adapter from &quot;HKDOCTOR&quot; that looks like this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Adaptor-Converter-Famicom-72-pin-to-60-pin-for-nes-games-Console-Nintendo-System-/321297315250">http://www.ebay.com/itm/Adaptor-Convert ... 1297315250</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It works for most things. There are a few games it has trouble with, like 3D World Runner uses the CHR address lines in a way that isn't supported by the adapter, for instance. This can be addressed by modifying the adapter, if needed, but the few games it doesn't run weren't an issue to me.<br /><br />If you want expansion audio to work, you need to mod it (cut the audio return loop, and basically connect the appropriate exp pin to the audio loop just like the audio mod you would have to do to your NES).
