Does anybody know which chips I can replace on the board to fix this? I have already replaced the electrolytic capacitors. I'm trying to keep my original board since I've had it since 1985.

Do it for both sides and then wipe the connector with some alcohol and it'll be good to go.

<br />The connector was certainly not the problem, I didn't try to replace all electolytic capcitors but if you say this didn't change a thing then this is probably not the problem in my NES either.
<br />
<br />I guess this has something to do with some heat problem, as once the NES freezes, it won't restart even if you reset or power cycle. Maybe changing the power supply completely by a modern switching regulator that doesn't dissipate heat would fix the problem ?

I suspected some kind of overheating, though I wouldn't even know where to start by installing a switching regulator. I was thinking of buying a new proven mobo and swapping out the PPU and CPU to see if that takes care of it.

<br />
<br />I would remove pull everything apart removing the screws and then just loosely put it back together without the screws.  Then play it till it freezes.  Pop it apart quick and feel all the ICs.  Nothing should be WARM except the power regulator.  The heat sink on the regulator should be warm but not HOT.
<br />
<br />If it is a problem with the power supply you should be able to just replace the bad components instead of a full switching PS replacement.

Perhaps shield off everything except that heat sink and blow a fan on it.  See if it keeps it cool enough to play longer or stay on.  
<br />
<br />Either way it's a fairly likely component to fail and wouldn't hurt to replace especially if it gets to hot to keep you fingers on.  My sink gets warm but never too hot to hold with your fingers.

<br />
<br />That looks to be you're direct replacement.  But I'm guessing any standard +5V 1A regulator you can get your hands on will work.
<br />
<br />EDIT: one good thing to check though, it's possible some other part has failed and is then drawing a lot of current so the voltage regulator can't keep up and over heats.  It would be a good idea to do a resistance check between Vcc and GND somewhere should be pretty high atleast a couple Kohms or more I don't know a more exact number.

<br />HA17805=7805
<br />check voltage on the pin 1(left pin, when you can see "face", some IC's have opposite). if there is more than 9V, you have to choose proper power supply. let me guess, yours is cheap noname "universal adaptor"

Also if you dissipating more than 30% of load, your transformer is not suitable - voltage is too high. Good switching regulator is quite expensive device, otherwise it's very good source of EMI  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
