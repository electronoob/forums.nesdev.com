		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I worked on this game where I am working this summer. As someone who doesn't like touch-screens and usually games on them, this was a bit of a compromise but I think it turned out pretty well. <br /><br />The controls are basic. Tap to jump, hold longer to jump higher, blah blah. The defining mechanic is that you can double-tap to do a dive-kick type thing in order to reach platforms you would otherwise miss. <br /><br />It is a really simple run and jump game, but it is very difficult and has an interesting mechanic to give the player more control (tap in the air to dive down). What differentiates it from <em>that type of game</em> is the weird stuff thrown in that just makes the game... <em>weird</em>. I was playing a lot of Parodius during down time, so I just felt like throwing in odd stuff. <br /><br />It employs exhaustive use of additive and subtractive blending for the little floating squares and color overlay. There are a lot of little quirky hidden graphics to discover, and the game changes itself as your high score gets higher. For example, the title screen music gains more instruments based on how high your top score is. The audio was made in FamiTracker for the game, sound effects and music alike. <br /><br />I did the game logic, a majority of the graphics, and (regrettably) the music (the music is not my best work but we were pressed for time!)<br /><br />Give it a shot! If you're stingy maybe I can give you a promo code. <br /><br /><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/runnan/id672915929?ls=1&amp;mt=8" class="postlink">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/runnan/id672915929?ls=1&amp;mt=8</a><br /><br /><img src="http://runnanthegame.com/img/shots/1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://runnanthegame.com/img/shots/4.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://runnanthegame.com/img/shots/3.png" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="http://runnanthegame.com/img/shots/2.png" alt="Image" />

This game was pooped out with RAD tools, so there isn't much to be done to optimize it. On 4S and above it runs full speed.
