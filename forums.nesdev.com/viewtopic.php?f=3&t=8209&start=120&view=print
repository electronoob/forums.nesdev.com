That is probably how it would look like on an older NTSC set.  Newer NTSC sets filter I &amp; Q at the same frequency.<br /><br />Try using 24 subpixels for both I and Q.<br /><br />Some NTSC sets recreate the chroma carrier by remodulating the filtered I and Q signals, and subtract it from the composite signal to get the Y.  Then you can filter Y with the 12 subpixel filter just to get rid of the artifacts you get when you subtract a square wave by a sine wave.<br /><br />I beleive this approach results in a slightly less noisy Y signal, but I could be wrong.</div>
<br />
<br />If your not busy, you can try this.  I have a feeling this will result in a good NTSC picture.  Not too noisy, not too blurry.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A couple of points:
<br />
<br />1) Video levels in general: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video">http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NTSC_video</a><!-- m --> takes the measured video levels and "normalizes" them so that white is at 1.0. But that's NOT what a real TV does --- a real TV doesn't know at which video level white will be (unless the picture content actually happens to show white), at least for baseband composite inputs. 
<br />
<br />A real TV can use two methods of automatic gain control (AGC) for video levels: looking at the sync level, and looking at the burst amplitude. For an RF-modulated signal, simply looking at the sync tip will be sufficient, as RF uses negative modulation in system M, so the sync tip (-40 IRE) is the maximum amplitude and 120 IRE (white would be 100 IRE) is the minimum. (This is also the reason why you can't have 100% yellow with RF, as that would be at 133 IRE, above the maximum 120 IRE or below the minimum voltage level).
<br />This is not possible when fed a baseband composite input, as that one does not use negative modulation, so a TV doesn't know what the maximum amplitude is going to be. Instead, for baseband composite input, a TV will either use no AGC at all (assuming levels to be perfect), or either
<br />- look at the difference between blanking and sync, which is how the IRE scale is defined in the first place, and adjust bias so that blanking is at 0 IRE and sync at -40 IRE,
<br />- look at the color burst amplitude, which should be 40 IRE, and scale everything accordingly. Of course, the color burst amplitude would normally be used for AGC on the demodulated chroma signal.
<br />
<br />No matter which AGC method is used, no method will result in exactly "normalized" NES colors 20 and 30 to be at 1.0; in fact, in most cases it will be slightly above 1.0. This is relevant insofar as if the picture becomes darker with all color emphasis bits enabled, white might still remain white, just not above 1.0 any more.
<br />
<br />2) Color space conversion: only do it with linear signals, not gamma-corrected ones. Meaning you first do an inverse transform to convert from gamma-corrected RGB levels to linear RGB light, apply the conversion matrix, then back to gamma-corrected RGB signals. Input color space is 1953 NTSC (since it's an NTSC signal), output color space is sRGB, because that's what your current computer monitor is supposed to be at. Keep in mind that because 1953 NTSC uses a different white point (Illuminant C instead of D65), whites and grays will have a very slight pinkish tint.
<br />Don't expect any TV without digital signal processing to do it that way though, as gamma un-correction and then re-correction is hard to do with analogue electronics. Instead, they will use a matrix multiplication with the gamma-corrected signals (producing errors for saturated colors), but using a different matrix that minimizes these errors.
<br />
<br />In general, when converting from NTSC to sRGB, colors will be oversaturated until you take chroma signal AGC based on the color burst amplitude into account.

<br />
<br />As for studio monitors, SMPTE RP 145 released in 1987 specifies the D65 white point. Of course, that document only made official what had been industry practice for some time.

Then again, since no real TV uses Illuminant C anymore (professional monitors are calibrated to D65, as mentioned before), you might have a point, although it's still interesting to see what the "NTSC reference receiver" would look like.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">that'll produce the same result as plugging an NES and a PC into different inputs on the same TV</div>At least on NTSC-only televisions, different inputs will likely produce different results. Because the NTSC standard assumes a widely different color space than SMPTE "C"/EBU/sRGB, a television set <em>must</em> convert the RGB colors from the NTSC decoder to the actual color space used by the TV's phosphors using a 3x3 conversion matrix. Since the YUV-to-RGB matrix (remember that almost no post-1960 consumer or professional TV actually recovers the wideband I-Q color difference signals; the "equiband" demodulation, as it's called, is essentially YUV demodulation, even though it's usually not called that way) is also a 3x3 matrix, these two matrices are usually folded into one by multiplication, which is where the whole business with decoding "angles" and "gains" and whatever comes from. 
<br />
<br />As VGA, component and RGB inputs bypass the YUV-to-RGB conversion stage, they necessarily also bypass the colorspace conversion. Hence, NTSC inputs (RF, composite, S-Video) will be color-corrected while all other inputs won't be, as the defined tolerances for EBU, sRGB and so on are usually larger than the actual differences between the phosphor used in the TV and what the standard calls for.
<br />
<br />PAL television sets that just happen to be NTSC compatible on the other hand (the demarcation between true NTSC and NTSC compatible is usually whether NTSC is only supported in baseband or also from an RF source) usually use the same color decoder matrix for NTSC and PAL --- since after demodulating NTSC without wideband I-Q recovery, both are functionally the same --- so they have no color correction capabilities, as PAL signals use the EBU color space, which is similar enough to modern phosphors not to require any correction. Hence, all inputs will look the same, apart from inherent differences such as cross-color artifacts and so on.
