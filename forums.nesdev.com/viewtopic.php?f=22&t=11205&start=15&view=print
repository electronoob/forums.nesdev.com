Ok, it's better to do Sprite-0 on top, DPCM on bottom. Wasn't aware of that.</div><br />Yeah, the main advantage of using DPCM for the second split is that it fires an interrupt, so even if your logic happens to take more time than expected you'll still be able to do the split without glitches.<br /><br />DPCM IRQs aren't as simple as they sound though... the sound hardware isn't aligned to the video hardware, so even if you ask for a sample to start playing at the exact same pixel every frame, the IRQ will fire with a variation of up to several scanlines (depending on the frequency of the sample). This means that the DPCM IRQ alone isn't enough for a clean split. Most commercial games that used it for raster effects had the IRQ fire right before a sprite 0 hit, which allowed for proper synchronization with the PPU.<br /><br />tepples linked to a discovery of his that greatly increases the control you have over when the DMC IRQ fires, but I found the whole thing too complex... to this day I still don't understand it completely. I believe it involves setting up a preliminary IRQ so you can count how long it takes to fire (a time that you waste every frame) and use that count later on to compensate for the misalignment. I was never able to replicate the idea perfectly on my end, and even when the thing was mostly stable I would occasionally (every few seconds or so) get a big timing variation.

You end up wasting up to 432 cycles, the period of one byte at speed 15. It should be fairly straightforward to get it at least as clean as SMB3's (admittedly glitchy) split, so long as you have a way to test on hardware.

The program code has to take care that there are not 2 monsters on the same level when the player comes along. Otherwise it would flicker...<br /><br />Seems like I won't have enough time to finish the NES version this year. But it is available now for C64, Windows, Mac and Linux.

I like the fact that there are separate builds for modern operating systems, and the 3 MB download size.<br /><br />What's the &quot;shader mode&quot; in the Windows version? It doesn't work on my computer (I have 8800 GTS, so I expected it to work).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@thefox: Nice to hear that you like it. I think it would be a nice NES cartridge. Several C64 players mentioned that it gives some kind of &quot;NES feeling&quot; when playing it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />The shader mode bends the display a bit. (like on a curved CRT monitor) Unfortunately, it does not work with every GFX chip and it's hard to debug if it works on your computer. That's why it is disabled by default. (does not look better than the default mode, anyway)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@lidnariq: Hm... Yes, you are right. There are some rooms which would be problematic and the monster placement would have to be changed a bit. But the red one-eyed &quot;Tap Tap&quot; robo only falls into areas without other robos. (if I remember correctly)<br /><br />As the 3 additional colors are used in the eyes only, another possibility would be: One robo just closes his eyes if there are too many sprites in a row! (Ha, I like this one)<br /><br />Wait a minute... if a robo only has 1 eye, then it only needs 3 sprites in one row. Two one-eye robots and a player does not flicker. It is complicated...
