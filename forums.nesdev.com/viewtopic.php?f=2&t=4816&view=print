		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello everybody, i have this problem with the nes and i expect some help if it isn't much of a trouble.
<br />I'm developing this program that basically shows some words on screen and allows the user to move a cursor on them to "select" them (this changes from nametable 0 to 1 and write the selected word again, then it appears like everything else has been deleted) and with another click, the program deselect it. i tested it with the FCEUXD emulator and it worked fine, but i wanted to make it work in real hardware so i modified a NROM cartridge (i already tested it with some games and it works, so the cartridge isn't the problem) and load the program into the eproms.
<br />the problem is that the words are written by parts, and sometimes not at all. i was thinking maybe somebody had some clues about what am i doing wrong that the emulator couldn't notice but the real NES does, and if you need everything (like the source) just reply.

<br />edit: i proved the program with both, nintendulator and nestopia, with the first one it has no problem either but with nestopia it only shows the sprites, not the background or anything else.

I believe they're marked kinda weird so people tend to think they have the correct setting but it turns out they got the wrong one. Try removing the blob of one of the pads and putting a blob on the other.
<br />
<br />edit: it also seems to only load up if I select pal mode. Sure you're not using too many cycles?
<br />
<br />edit2: Switching mirroring DOES seem to give an effect sorta like you describe. (or at least as I understand it)

<br />There are over three times as many CPU cycles in an NTSC NES's vertical blanking than in a PAL NES's. NTSC has 20 lines of vblank at 341/3 cycles each for 2273 cycles; PAL has 70 lines at 341/3.2 cycles each for 7459 cycles. So if you're rewriting large portions of the nametables or uploading lots of tiles to CHR RAM, you'll have to heavily optimize your PPU code if you want to release outside Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. With no slick tricks other than partly unrolled loops to copy from a transfer buffer in RAM, you can squeeze in a sprite DMA and roughly 160 bytes of copies to VRAM. You can carve this buffer out of the stack if you want: <ul><li>$0100-$019F: VRAM transfer buffer </li><li>$01A0-$01FF: stack </li><li>$0200-$02FF: OAM transfer buffer </li></ul>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ok, so the routine is too large for a NTSC video mode and maybe is so large that even the rendering is not finished on time and that could explain the words being cut. Assuming that's the case, what can i do to make it fit, can i make this routine take more that one frame to "refresh" the nametable so that it can fit in NTSC mode? how?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When updates take too long to fit in VBlank even after you optimize the hell out of the code, you have 2 options:
<br />
<br /><strong>1:</strong> Disable rendering. While rendering is disabled, you can write to the PPU as much as you want, and when you're done you can enable rendering again. Notice that the screen will be blank during the time you are copying the data, so this solution is good for when you want to change the whole screen, but sucks for animating a screen that is already being displayed, because the image would flicker with each update.
<br />
<br /><strong>2:</strong> Break up the large update into smaller ones and do them across consecutive VBlanks. Most games do this as the camera scrolls, as they draw small portions of tiles (in the form of rows or columns) instead of rewriting the whole background. If the kind of animation you are making looks bad when done in parts, you can always write the new data to the hidden name table and display that once all data has been written.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, thanks for the support, i already made a link to the source some posts up.
<br />As you can see in the .nes (by the way, the .nes is proved to be right with fceuxdsp, some bugs with Nintendulator and only the cursor works with Nestopia), the writing and changing of the nametables happen when the cursor is on the word and 'A' is pressed, then if 'A' is pressed again anywhere the word selected is 'erased' from NT1 and the NTs switch again to the original state, so i'd say that without the first writing of all the words, the refreshing only happen in 3 rows.
