<br />Wow... That's super retarded. An emulator should be able to assume that the ROM given isn't corrupted, and not have to go the extra mile to see if it is.

<br />Should be. In practice, a lot of ROM images in the wild have trash in the reserved bytes. Adding a check for known corruptions greatly improves the user experience, rather than just giving her some kind of unexpected behaviour.

That way you don't need to worry about which donor cart to use. </div><br />I'm pretty sure nobody will agree on what features are essencial and what features aren't, and in the end nothing serious will be done. Also, too many people seems to be under the impression that to do a good game you need a good mapper. This is wrong, SMB is the proof.<br /></div>
<br />
<br />I wholeheartedly agree with that. Building some kind of super-mapper is somehow undermining the whole point of coding for an obsolete game system, because if you want better graphics or sound, then choose a modern platform. I mean, shouldn't it be about the challenge to see what you could have done if you were a NES developer back in the day? What creative way you can come up with to deal with the limitations of this old architecture? Perhaps even design a good game while you're at it?
<br />
<br />Designing a good game is the hardest part of all, and no extra RAM or super mapper will help you much with that if your idea sucks. People underestimate how much work went into the design of those classic games, thinking they can surpass those efforts with additional hardware.

While I haven't yet seen a homebrew that actually needs something that big I am sure a few people are working on games that do.  SMB shows a good game can be basic hardware, but SMB3 shows a good game can be more advanced hardware too.

It's pretty cool that the MMC1 board is available, but I've wondered why MMC3 hasn't followed, is there some technical limitation in the way?

It could also be because a true, non-hacked IRQ counter hasn't been worked out, MMC3 is still buggy on the PowerPak for me <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />

<br />
<br />Take the MMC3, and fix its CHR banks to values that span 8 KiB (0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7). For example, a CHR RAM game such as MM4, MM6, or FF3 might use them this way. That frees up 48 flip-flops: 46 for the CHR bank registers and 2 for bits 2-1 of $8000. Now how many macrocells are left? Is it one macrocell for each flip-flop?

<br />I think that he CAN make MMC3 boards, but doesn't advertise this as nobody has wanted/needed one and that the cost is much higher.  Like $40 for parts?

<br />Just $1-2 higher for a larger CPLD.
