There was also the Family Basic kit released for the Famicom, allowing you to make your own NES games, or rather programs, and with it came a keyboard.  Is it possible to do, and if so, how difficult would it be?  While adding keyboard support to a game sounds like a trivial effort nowadays, I'm well aware that to do even the simplest of things on the NES required entire paragraphs of code just to make it work.<br /><br />On the flip side, this would also work really well for games with alphanumeric passwords.

It can help much.
