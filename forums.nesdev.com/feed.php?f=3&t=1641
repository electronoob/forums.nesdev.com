I can save the state of each parallel task separately, and just use whatever simulated time they are currently at when I save them.  As long as you save that time as well, you can resume it accurately.  (If you try to get the times as close together as you reasonably can before saving, it allows less precise emulators to import your savestate and ignore the fact that the state was actually from different times, and they can mostly get away with it).  I will only capture state at predefined "safe" points (such as between instructions).  At these "safe" points, all of the state will be up to date in my context structures (i.e. there won't be any values needed from host machine registers, or anything like that).  There was a lengthy discussion about this awhile ago.  There was some question about whether what I'm describing was general/reliable enough, but I think that it is (and I hope I get far enough one day to prove it).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=330">mozz</a> — Wed Jun 14, 2006 3:04 pm</p><hr />

The whole point of sacrificing high level abstraction and portability is to get the performance boost of being able to write code which will be relatively consistent.

The key here is that something like sprite 0 collision does not actually affect PPU state used for rendering, so it doesn't have to stop on an event like that.

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What's being proposed here by tepples and others is not this; the proposal is to use optimized code where it has no side-effects. For example, if a game doesn't touch the PPU registers for the entire frame, you can use optimized tile and sprite rendering, without any effect on accuracy.<br /></div><br /><br />And when you get a game that <em>does</em> touch the PPU registers mid-frame, you need to switch to a scanline renderer. And when they touch PPU regs mid-scanline you need a dot renderer. I find it easier to just implement one thing (the dot renderer) and get consistent performance for all games.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />There seems to be significant negativity towards designs that optimize performance of an emulator. In the past people had to focus on efficiency, and they often did this in ways that unnecessarily sacrificed accuracy. I think the activity is enjoyable, though it has nothing to do with emulation in specific. In my emulator I've had fun keeping it efficient while still passing some of my most rigorous test ROMs (and not just "passing" them in a hacky way). It's a more general activity of doing software engineering and examining possible tradeoffs.<br /></div><br /><br />This is my fault, and I apologize. I was defending my approach in response to comments here and at another board that something is "seriously wrong" if an emulator has high requirements (2-3ghz). The attitude seemed to be because ZSNES can do something with 20x the power of the SNES, an accurate emulator should not require more than 30x or it is flawed in some way, so I was defending my viewpoint.<br /><br />I did not mean to convey this was the only way it could be done. In fact, I agree with your viewpoint and I eagerly await to see what mozz and similar programmers come up with for the SNES :D<br /><br />But I still stand by my statement that there's nothing wrong with requiring a modern mid-range PC for an emulator, regardless of what system it's targeting, so long as you aren't unnecessarily being stupid. eg writing the whole thing in Visual Basic and plotting each pixel for HQ4x using GDI's SetPixel API call. My pure algorithmic code is actually quite well optimized (especially the add/sub code, thanks blargg!). It's just my general "reference" approach that makes it so slow. And it runs fullspeed on a processor that can be had for $60 brand new from major retailers (3ghz Celeron).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Correction: the x86 architecture is psychotic. If you've used other architectures, you'd find them infinitely refreshing in their regularity and efficiency (the same way the 6502 and 65816 are). I take it using a compiler for x86 these days is generally a win?<br /></div><br /><br />I can usually double performance of critical routines by rewriting them in x86 assembler. And I optimize both the c++ and assembler code pretty well. Any algorithmic defencencies I have are reflected in both versions of the code, so you can't blame that.<br /><br />Still, I'd love to get a system with a really good processor (G5 maybe?) that runs FreeBSD and all of the packages I need. But I won't pay over $200 for a complete tower, and it'd better be new, too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />There's nothing wrong with an emulator design that favors ease-of-maintenance over ultimate efficiency. In these discussions there seems to be the notion that only one design is right, and the others are wrong and should be avoided.<br /></div><br /><br />Yes there is, and that's why I followed suit. Sorry once again.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />What about special features that require a fast emulator, like arbitrary seeking in a movie, real-time reverse playback, or showing a wall of emulators all running at full speed? (all of which are quite cool features to see)<br /></div><br /><br />Your wall emulator and rewind features are indeed very cool :D<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Tue Jun 13, 2006 3:54 pm</p><hr />

Sorry for the long post.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Disch wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Even if you optimize it down to the scanline that Sprite 0 is on... checks will still be causing the emu to split those 8 scanlines every 2 instructions.<br /></div><br /><br />OK, so a simple version's worst-case performance could be 16 scanlines out of 240 rendered lines, 7% of the total. That leaves 93% of the scanlines potentially rendered in an optimal way. What if you predict exactly when the sprite 0 hit will occur? Then you don't have to switch to fine rendering mode unless this prediction gets invalidated by PPU writes, something that is uncommon.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />[Pirate Mapper 90] has an IRQ counter which can be driven by PPU reads and CPU writes... efficiently tracking all of that inside an emulator can make things extraordinarily complicated extremely fast.<br /></div><br /><br />This is a problem; even simple hardware driven by odd sets of signals can be very difficult to optimize. The general divide-and-conquer optimization strategy will probably help as usual: optimize for the common case and the few exceptions will just be slower.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Getting it all "accurate" will lead to a very complicated program. And there's no way such a program will ever be in the same performance ballpark as something that simplified and optimized it all as much as NESticle did.<br /></div><br /><br />The question is, are these quirks actually invoked in common NES programs? It would be an interesting study to seek out consequential quirks invoked by NES programs, as a way to prove that such an emulator is impossible (rather than speculate as we are).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">byuu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I won't emulate the same thing two ways and switch between the more accurate and faster version depending on whether or not the game needs it at a certain point. That gets sloppy real quick, and you waste too much time maintaining rather than discovering new hardware quirks and such.<br /></div><br /><br />What's being proposed here by tepples and others is not this; the proposal is to use optimized code where it has no side-effects. For example, if a game doesn't touch the PPU registers for the entire frame, you can use optimized tile and sprite rendering, without any effect on accuracy.<br /><br />There seems to be significant negativity towards designs that optimize performance of an emulator. In the past people had to focus on efficiency, and they often did this in ways that unnecessarily sacrificed accuracy. I think the activity is enjoyable, though it has nothing to do with emulation in specific. In my emulator I've had fun keeping it efficient while still passing some of my most rigorous test ROMs (and not just "passing" them in a hacky way). It's a more general activity of doing software engineering and examining possible tradeoffs.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Processors continue to get more and more psychotic. Nowadays, you execute an xchg opcode and it's sixteen times slower than three mov opcodes on Pentium IVs. That kind of thing didn't happen on the 386es ZSNES was designed for.  Optimizing for a generic x86 target is a journey into madness. It's best to just follow a few simple rules (don't use obscure opcodes, try and use the full register sizes whenever possible, etc) and go with that.<br /></div><br /><br />Correction: the x86 architecture is psychotic. If you've used other architectures, you'd find them infinitely refreshing in their regularity and efficiency (the same way the 6502 and 65816 are). I take it using a compiler for x86 these days is generally a win?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'll still continue to go for simplicity, and my emulator has always been more of a self-documenting reference platform than a true user-friendly emu. And I anticipate it always remaining easier to implement new findings into my design than any emu aiming for speed. I just added on a bunch of UI stuff since I had about 10,000 people using it anyway. Heck, I use it myself since it runs at 2-3x speed on my PC, so why not?<br /></div><br /><br />There's nothing wrong with an emulator design that favors ease-of-maintenance over ultimate efficiency. In these discussions there seems to be the notion that only one design is right, and the others are wrong and should be avoided. All designs involve tradeoffs and each one emphasizes some things over others, like programming skill needed to implement it, target platforms, clarity, language of implementation, efficiency, etc. There's no need to trivialize other designs as a way to justify your decisions; the fact that there is a tradeoff means that neither can meet all the demands equally and that each design has its merits and is worth being implemented by someone.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I really think this will become less and less of a concern in the future.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure that method would work for CPU&lt;&gt;APU. Maybe keep 64 before&lt;&gt;after mirrors for CPU&lt;&gt;PPU as well. You'll still need to split the CPU core up into cycles in order to get DMA synchronization timing correct, though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=375">byuu</a> — Tue Jun 13, 2006 11:14 am</p><hr />

(in theory writes are less common than reads; there's no reason why you couldn't choose to do this on reads instead).  For the majority of reads and writes, the CPU is the only thing that can interact with that memory so there's no need to calculate the exact time the read or write would occur at.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=330">mozz</a> — Tue Jun 13, 2006 10:15 am</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Take BSNES for example. The fundamental reason its way slower than ZSNES is not because it has to do more work than ZSNES does to emulate accurately. The main reason BSNES is so slow is because it was written to be clear and maintainable, rather than to be high-performance.<br /></div><br /><br />Right. I intentionally implement things in a way I know won't be as fast sometimes. The APU is the "perfect black box" that all other emus enslave to the CPU clock. I treat it like real hardware would and make them independant of each other. I don't optimize based on guessing/probability/etc, eg I won't emulate the same thing two ways and switch between the more accurate and faster version depending on whether or not the game needs it at a certain point. That gets sloppy real quick, and you waste too much time maintaining rather than discovering new hardware quirks and such.<br />Not to mention the code is very object-oriented. Lots of virtual function calls abound. But at the same time, I can swap between two CPU cores by modifying a single word in the main header file. Or do it at runtime.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Having looked through ZSNES code, I don't even think a lot of it is optimal---the assembly cores for example, contain a lot of 8-bit register use and look like they would incur plenty of partial register stalls on P2/P3 hardware, and could probably be speeded up 10-20% or more simply by rewriting them to avoid that.<br /></div><br /><br />I'm sure you're aware why it is "slow", but for those who aren't: it was written nearly ten years ago. Processors continue to get more and more psychotic. Nowadays, you execute an xchg opcode and it's <em>sixteen times</em> slower than three mov opcodes on Pentium IVs. That kind of thing didn't happen on the 386es ZSNES was designed for.<br /><br />Optimizing for a generic x86 target is a journey into madness.
