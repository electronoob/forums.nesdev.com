Positive... It uses the standard decoding for &lt;= 16M games. From the scan I see it uses /LDSW (odd addresses) which IIRC is the most typical configuration as well. Also as to be expected you can see the game has 8 KiB/64 kilobits of SRAM too. There is absolutely nothing special about this cart.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Thu Jul 12, 2012 10:47 pm</p><hr />

I can't remember exactly how this works... When you use byte mode writes the 68K puts the byte on both D15..8 and D7..0 so to handle writes you'd would only need to swap the write strobes, but I don't *think* it'll work for reads. For it to work the 68K would need pullups on the data bus, it'd AND D15..8 and D7..0 into a single 8-bit byte, then maybe replicate that byte back into a word. This is all horribly undocumented... Even if that works, if a game decides to do word access it will fail. The only sure way to swap even/odd addresses would be to swap the /UDSW to /LDSW (big endian typo in my last post), and swap D7..0 to D15..8. The easiest way to find out whether you actually need to do this is to look at the game's Sega header.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Fri Jul 06, 2012 10:49 am</p><hr />

I think the signals he's talking about are B28 and B29. On what I think is an old World Series Baseball board I have, B28 (LDS) is what connects and UDS doesn't. <br /><br />Seeing the original board would ofcourse be the easiest way to figure it out. But if you want to try you could cut the trace from B28 and connect it to B29 swapping the signals.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1726">MottZilla</a> — Fri Jul 06, 2012 9:45 am</p><hr />
