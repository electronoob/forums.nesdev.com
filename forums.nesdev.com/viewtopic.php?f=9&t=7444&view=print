		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys. Does anyone here have the Final Fantasy VII Chinese remake that came out a few years ago? 
<br />
<br />I am interested in buying a copy and was wondering if I might be able to look at its PCB.
<br />
<br />The big question I have is if it would be possible to use the chinese version's PCB as a donor board for a reproduction of the English translation patch. I wonder since the game's ROM is 2MB. If the game isn't a globtop, those would be some massive CHR and PRG banks!
<br />
<br />I've been playing the english patch on my PSP and think it's really special enough to warrant all the hard work of tracking down the original and then sending it off to a skilled NES reproduction master. 
<br />
<br />If my plan is sound, does anyone know where I might lok for a copy? Thanks.

<br />Track an original legit PS1/PC version then. It's way, way, way, way, way, way better than this horrible Chinese crap.
<br />
<br />Anyone who plays this piece of shit for more than 1 minute either have a grave mental problem or is an enemy of the real FF7.

Who knows if it has glop tops or not. Bregalad has a point though. I would say unless you can get a cartridge for cheap, don't waste your money. Particularly since you don't know that it isn't glop tops.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What mapper does your emulator state that it's using?
<br />
<br />It's possible that given the relative simplicity you could replicate it without the chinese cartridge. I may have it (I'd need to see a photo to know if it's the right game though) and could check, but I think it's Waixing-made, and Waixing stuff is usually globbie.
<br />
<br />Even so, that doesn't make wiring one impossible, just extremely tedious. You'd still need to know the wafer connections to make it work though. I'd like to fix some of the problems in Waixing's 'Triforce of the Gods', and do an English patch for it, but it just isn't feasible for me at this point to dedicate any energy to doing so. 
<br />
<br />In any case, as I said, if it is actually using the FF3 engine and not its own custom one, you could get away with putting it on different donor-carts; MMC3 if memory serves. It may be MMC3 compatible... Then again, even it it is using the FF3 code, they could have converted it to a custom mapper for cost reasons. It's really hard to say with HK/Chinese originals.
<br />
<br />Report back with the mapper that it's using...
<br />
<br />I'm still with you that it's fun to peter about with these conversions. I'd much rather play a downgraded 8-bit rendition of a newer game than the real thing. The lack of action &amp; platforming games makes it tough though and the few that come out tend to be on the terrible side. A shame really: TotG could have been stellar, if they put a little more time into the attack engine (moving and attacking at the same time would be nice, instead of stopping dead every time you use a weapon) and actually converting the music from the SFC title instead of the Chinese traditional melodies would have been bitch'n...
<br />
<br />Oh well...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's using its own engine that was also used in several other HKO RPG games, like that awful Zelda one.  It has no relation to the FF3 engine.
<br />
<br />The mapper appears to be a 32k bankswitching mapper, kind of like the RARE games, but supporting a much larger maximum cartridge size.  Much code is actually placed in the NES's internal RAM so it can switch banks eaiser.
<br />Supposedly it also has an Automatic CHR switch halfway down the screen mode for title screens, but I don't know whether or not that feature is real, or how it actually works.  Some emulators just implement it as switching the PPUCTRL byte halfway down the screen automatically, but I know that can't be correct.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, it uses its own mapper something called NJ063 whatever that means. 
<br />
<br />I asked about it on Famicom World and was given the following info: 
<br />
<br />I opened my FFVII and saw two globs and three
<br />ICs, transcribed below:
<br />
<br />- SANYO LC3664BML-10 JAPAN 4GU1
<br />- CY6264-70SC 9639 312158
<br />- MX E013345 29LV160BTC-90 TAIWAN
<br />
<br />The latter one is the 16Mb memory IC.
<br />
<br />I'm guessing [hoping] the globs are for the mapper (no idea what the other two would be though) and the proper chips are CHR, PRG and...SRAM?
<br />
<br />What do you think?

<br />
<br />edit:LC3664BML-10 is 64K of RAM
<br />CY6264-70SC is  8K of RAM
<br />and 29LV160BTC-90 appears to be a 16M-BIT flash rom  (16 megabits =2 megabytes)
<br />
<br />so it would be the CHR-RAM, SRAM, and then PRG ROM  
<br />
<br />It would appear you only have one ROM to replace and the one built in may be reprogrammable.
<br />
<br />edit:nestopia confirms it uses chr-ram

<br />
<br />I would have to look it up to be sure.
<br />
<br />edit: well if it can be programed with ease in circuit I am not smart enough to figure out how. Regular willem programmers can flash it for you though so if your good at desoldering and own a programmer you wont have to buy anything.
<br />
<br />There are plenty of people who are a hell of a lot more knowledgeable than me, maybe one of them will chime in. 
<br />It defiantly can be done, somebody who dose the repro carts should be able to handle the necessary work if its really worth the money to you.
