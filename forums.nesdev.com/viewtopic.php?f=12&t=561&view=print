<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.snesmusic.org/files/soundmod.jpg">http://www.snesmusic.org/files/soundmod.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />I've open up two PAL SNES and one NTSC SNES... and none of them have that type of APU... =/
<br />all of them have the chips directly on the mainboard and not in any special module that is connected through that black connector (marked 6).
<br />Is it some old version of the SNES? like the first? Or can it only be found in the Super Famicom (thats the only one I havn't checked)?

<br />
<br />it seems like I'm 'lucky' enough to have one of the newer revisions &gt;_&lt;
<br />
<br />edit:
<br />So how do I know that it's one of the old versions that had the SHVC-SOUND boxes in it, when I'm out to buy a new SNES?

<br />That's right, but a lot of people did the same with the GBA and nobody seems to complain.

<br />
<br />but if you felt so offended by this thread I hope that the moderators can move this to the SNES section. So that I get some relevant answers instead <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

<br />
<br />I agree, someone should have moved that conversation.  But that doesn't make it any better for this post to be so blatantly in the wrong place.  At least the GBA discussion grew out of a NES thread.  This thread was clearly created in the wrong place.  It could have been an accident, we all make mistakes.  I only pointed it out so that people would put a little thought into where their posts go.
<br />I don't read the SNES forum (as evidenced by the fact that I didn't know it existed) but I regularly read this one.  If it starts getting dilluted with SNES/GBA etc. content I'm less likely to stay up to date with it.  Never mind how unorganized and hard to search the forums become when posts are in the wrong forums.
<br />I didn't mean to make a big deal out of this, just trying to save myself future headaches by preventing forum pollution.

<br />
<br />Yeah, it's all cool.
<br />
<br />I believe the first SNES's sold in the US have that seperate sound board, and later they used the single board design (before the later one that had a different case).  I'm not sure how they did it in other regions.
