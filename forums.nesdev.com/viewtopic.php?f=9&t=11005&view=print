		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was reading an old post about converting NES games to SNES ones: http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=5826 I was wondering if this project got off the ground, and if it could help me out. I got a Supaboy a few weeks ago, and I wanted to get someone to try a project for me. I say TRY because I'm not 100% sure that it's possible. After seeing how well translated Famicom games like Akira can actually make sense, I wanted to have a version of the original NES Legend Of Zelda with a better translation than 'Buy something will ya!&quot;. I found a site that has very simple translations, but I've been told that due to the limitations of the NES cart's memory, the official version's all I've got. I've also heard the original stereo, and in my opinion, better sounds and music from the Famicom Disk System version, and if I can ever get my hands on that disk, I'll play it. Would it be possible to have a better, more faithfully  translated version of the NES Zelda, with the stereo FDS sound, that would work on an SNES cart, so that I could play it on my SNES 2, my Supaboy, and the RetroN 5, if it ever becomes available to buy? If it isn't, no big, just wondering. If it is, is there anyone that would be willing to do the project for me? I'd pay for any donor carts, parts, and labor. I'm on a fixed, almost non existent budget, so I might have to work out a payment plan, but I WANT to play a better version of Zelda!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nice pun, but I already know about Zelda BS. If the makers of the only translated SNES cart that I can afford start making them again, I'll get it, because after playing the ROM a few months ago, I liked what I saw. I want the ORIGINAL FDS sound, Famicom game ( for the Vols glitch, if I can ever get a way to make a Famicom miked controller work on an SNES), and a better translation than the 80's gave us. No offense, because I loved the original NES version, but after playing the Famicom cart, and hearing what the FDS version was like, I believe there could possibly be a BETTER version of the game. I'm calling it Legend Of Zelda: Hyrule Fantasy. Unfortunately, a fantasy might be all it will ever be.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's quite possible.  Several NES games have been ported to the Turbografx-16 by one person.<br /><br />The SNES is a little more complicated (as the TG-16 is more similar to the NES than the SNES is) but you can do it.<br /><br />You'll need to learn 65816 and SPC-700 assembly.  The SPC program will accept command bytes (ie:pseudo-NES-and-FDS-sound-register-writes) that your conversion program sends it, and will have to emulate the NES and FDS channels.  This is why you'll need SPC assembly in addition to 65816.<br /><br />Sound easy?  Then, get porting!  ;-D
