<br />
<br />And yet, that doesn't stop people from creating NES emulators and homebrews that secure only 1% of users. In this case, 1% is enough. I would be ecstatic with 1%. What if 90% of users still used Nesticle, even today? Would you be comfortable with that? Would you just accept defeat and develop for Nesticle by coding for all its mapper hacks and wrong behaviors, essentially making your homebrew incompatible with the system and emulators more like the system. Being agreeable to the ignorant masses is more important to you than making sure the most archival option exists for all time? I see you've lost your balls, allow me to fetch them for you.

<br />
<br />ZapManager isn't a conversion tool, it's a GUI rom validation tool on my website. The link to my website is in the format guide.
<br />
<br />As for the value of a conversion tool, it would probably do more harm than good. I guarantee you that if a programmer could help me do step 7, you'd be able to find a set within a month on any rom board or filehost search engine. I'm not a programmer, I'm a dumper.

<br />
<br />See, now you're just trolling. This is the 5th time someone has claimed this and it couldn't be more false. iNES will continue to work for unlicensed games. And who knows, maybe someone will create an external format to replace it completely, then licensed games can use a database and unlicensed can come with a mapper file that allows for custom mappers.

<br />Windows only cares about the last extension (.zip in this case), and an extension can only have one associated program.

<br />However, I don't think this format will catch on solely for the fact that it doesn't support homebrew and unlicensed... 
<br />To put it this way, my ROM list wont see an update until I actually see a benefit in using it, and so far, I don't see any benefit yet. (Yes, yes, no bad headers.. I know.. But that hasn't been a problem for me.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for reminding me of a link I had missed. I updated the status of two of the steps. Now I'll address specific points from the spec:
<br />
<br /><div class="quotetitle">FitzRoy wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">For now, I am using the same assignments as iNES.</div><br />Case in point: StarTropics and StarTropics 2. These have MMC6, whose behavior differs from other mapper 4 ROMs. WRAM Present = "None" might mislead, as MMC6 certainly has battery-backed WRAM albeit internal to the mapper IC. So I guess an emulator would need to fall back on field 10 (mapper IC) has to be used like a submapper field.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It should still be possible to soft-patch games in this format because soft-patching does not interfere with checksum lookup.</div><br />How would these soft-patches be distributed? As separate patches to prg and chr? As zipfiles containing a patch to prg and chr? As patches to a virtual file containing two or three concatenated files (a 16-byte file, "prg", and "chr" if present, in that order)? And how would soft-patches that change the board type by adding WRAM, a battery, etc. work?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I exclude unlicensed games for the same reason that emulator authors don't bother emulating the endless streams of unlicensed add-ons and clone systems: they are a maintenance nightmare</div><br />So the main file contains only games with the Official Nintendo Seal. I understand the reasoning behind this. But if we limit it to only unlicensed games commercially released in North America and Europe prior to the release of the Nintendo 64 console (Sunday Funday  yes, Battle Kid no), I don't see how an additional ZapFC_North_American_Unlicensed_(20110216).fbsv file containing Tengen, Camerica, Color Dreams, etc. would be a nightmare to maintain. There's a finite set of these companies because there's a finite set of their CIC defeat circuits.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Wkter wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">tepples wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">7. Write a short Windows program that determines whether a given .zip file is fc.zip or just plain .zip and starts the appropriate program (emulator or archive manager respectively)</div><br />Windows only cares about the last extension (.zip in this case), and an extension can only have one associated program. Leave out the .zip part and instead name it .zfc, or else the emulator will open ALL zip files, complain when it isn't a valid ROM, and the users will curse the emulator</div><br />That's exactly why I proposed the short Windows program. The emulator wouldn't see all zip files. The .zip extension would be associated with the short Windows program. Any file appearing to meet the spec (filename ends in .fc.zip case insensitive; contents are one file called "prg" or two files called "prg" and "chr") would cause the program to launch the emulator; otherwise, it'd launch 7-Zip.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">However, I don't think this format will catch on solely for the fact that it doesn't support homebrew and unlicensed</div>
<br />Homebrew can continue to use iNES or NES 2.0 because homebrew developers appear to care more about distributing correct headers than commercial ROM collectors do. Unlicensed I addressed above.

<br />
<br />Me either. I am admittedly clueless when it comes to emulators, but I've never had a problem getting roms to work properly. Is that the reason for this headerless format? (Sorry if that was answered earlier in this thread, but I don't have an hour to burn reading it <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> )
