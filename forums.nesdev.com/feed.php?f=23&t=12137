SMS2 VDP is not exclusively used in EU machines, whole variety is represented.<br /><br />The whole PAL-M, N etc is irrelevant, the only difference is framerate and color subcarrier. Framerate is selectable between 50/60 on all VDP versions and color subcarrier is dependant on the crystal used with the RGB encoder circuit outside the VDP.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3483">TmEE</a> — Mon Dec 22, 2014 8:06 pm</p><hr />

Alright, or maybe it was actually being converted by the RF unit (which is separate). Although that leaves composite - but then again, if the TVs supported NTSC it was probably easier to just output NTSC then. I know that in Argentina TVs became able to support both NTSC and PAL-N because VHS players were imported from the US and thereby NTSC, but the local TV signal was PAL-N, and having TVs support both was the easiest solution to that (eventually later that expanded to supporting PAL-M as well, since that allowed exporting the TVs to Brazil).<br /><br />Pretty much every Mega Drive I've seen here was NTSC or PAL-N though (or toggled between those when they had a region switch), but if there was a RF unit it'd be always PAL-N (in practice everybody used composite instead). We also got the model 3 which is NTSC-only so it's safe to assume that by that point going NTSC-only was safe in Argentina.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Mon Dec 22, 2014 8:04 pm</p><hr />

Well, later NTSC systems also had the fixed VDP, it's just that in those territories it was kind of useless since you couldn't rely on everybody having it. But on other places it was a safe bet, to the point that Codemasters would always use the 224 height resolution instead of the 192 one (I wonder if they were even aware that the 224 one wasn't present in all consoles).<br /><br />But yeah, it's likely that TecToy's systems were using the fixed VDP. I'm not sure if they were using PAL-M though (Brazil is next to a PAL-N territory after all, many TVs were NTSC + PAL-N + PAL-M compatible, and they also sold consoles in Argentina which is a PAL-N territory).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4526">Sik</a> — Mon Dec 22, 2014 10:56 am</p><hr />
