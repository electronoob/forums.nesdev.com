		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />A friend gave me a very nice NES frontloader with a few games, 2 controllers, and even a Zapper! Nice!<br /><br />Sadly, it has the red blink of death, which I thought to be either a dirty cartridge connector, a bad NES10 chip, or both! I decided to pull it apart, clean the connector, and disconnect pin 4 of the CIC/NES10/Lockout chip.<br /><br />Originally, I'd wanted to desolder the whole chip, neatly bend the pin up, and solder it back in sans pin 4, but my gas-powered soldering iron just couldn't generate enough heat to wick the solder up into the braid.<br /><br />Next, I tried snipping the pin... but my diagonal cutters were too big. I was able to &quot;nick&quot; the pin, but not cut it.<br /><br />In my impatience, I used a tiny screwdriver to break the pin at the nick, but sadly the pin pulled out from the IC instead. Not proud of that, I should have waited until I had proper tools. I didn't think it would matter though, as the pin is now disconnected. Besides, I've seen way worse hackjobs on the internet, and the authors of those guides didn't indicate any issues.<br /><br />When I put the NES back together, I now get no power light. There's a slight &quot;pop&quot; on my TV's audio when I press the power button, but nothing else. Video remains black. Did I ruin my CIC/NES10/Lockout chip? Would a ruined chip keep the console from starting? Should I desolder a NES10 chip from a game (a lame one), and solder it into my console with pin 4 neatly bent away?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, try adding the two wires.<br /><br />The CIC is the device that drives the &quot;power&quot; LED (hence why it blinks when the CIC fails), so if something went wrong with the CIC, it could never release reset and never light the LED.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><div class="quotetitle">lidnariq wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yeah, try adding the two wires.</div><br />That worked beautifully, thank you very much! I went from a seemingly dead console with no power light to full function by soldering in those two wires. I ended up using the <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=10091#p112028" class="postlink">first example (yellow wires)</a> instead of the <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=10091#p117410" class="postlink">second (white wires)</a>, because my unit was missing a pad from the second screenshot. I'm pretty sure it was on a big ground plane, but I didn't want to be wrong.<br /><br />After cleaning up the rest of the console and cleaning out the controllers, we've been playing it for a couple of hours with no issues.<br /><br />I wonder if this would work if pin 4 was not disconnected at all? If so, that would be much safer and easier than trying to disconnect pin 4 from the CIC IC. I can't quite tell from the other thread whether the lockout chip still needs to be there for this to work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, the two wires defeat the CIC altogether.<br /><br />One wire keeps the 4MHz clock from operating and thus keeps the CIC from executing any code; the other wire converts the signal from the reset button to the format needed by the CPU and PPU.<br /><br />I'm <em>pretty</em> certain that the two wires would still do the right thing even if the CIC IC were missing altogether, but I haven't actually thought about it.<br /><br />I came up with the &quot;add two wires, remove CIC and clock, move resistor&quot; plan before I was made aware of the &quot;just two wires&quot; mod, and I haven't really thought about it since.
