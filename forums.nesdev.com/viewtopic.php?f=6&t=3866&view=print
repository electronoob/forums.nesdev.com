		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I hesitated to post this in the NESdev section, but in fact altrough gamedev related it's more music related, so I post it here.
<br />
<br />I'm currently composing music for my game, and coding it into sequenced format. Because I don't use any kind of PRG bankswitching, I want music data to be as small as possible. And I noted music quickly takes a considerable amount of space, even in compact format.
<br />
<br />Since the format I use uses "octave up" and "octave down" commands, I found me always use an insane amount of them at some place where the melody have a lot of transition between notes just above C and just below C, and a lot of bytes could be saved by transposing the song up or down so that the melody would be always above C or below C on those part, thrun not crossing an octave boundary, saving bytes. But by doing this I'm forced to transpose and rewrite the entiere song, and as it may decrease octave crosses somewhere it can incrase them somewhere else. I wonder if there is any way to find the "ideal" tuning of a song so that there is as less octave crosses as possible.
<br />Another big space wasting thing is "short notes". I mean using a note then a silence to ensure the note is short. This will make the song sound much more dynamic than if all notes are played full, where the song will sound blatant boring. But it also significantly incrase the number of bytes needed to code the song, by placing note-silent-note-silent instead of just note-note-note. A solution is to decay the note, but even long decayed notes sounds much less dynamic than short notes.
<br />
<br />So I wonder if music data should be composed as it, then once the song is finished and completed consider it "untouchable" and code it as it, or if, as being the same person as the composer and coder, can take advantage of this. Should I transpose my song to have an insane amounts of sharps and flats in it just to save a dozen of bytes ? Should I use longer notes so that it takes less encoding space even if this doesn't sound the same ? Or should I just encode the song as if someone else made it without even considering altering it ? I think that's an interesiting, but somewhat difficult chose to take.
<br />
<br />As I consider music transposing barely affect it (only sound lower or higher), I think this can be considered if it saves a lot of bytes. However some people consider key is important, as older pieces of musics are refered as "Bb concerto, F concerto", etc... this makes the key in which they were composed very important. However since this isn't the case any longer today, I think I shoudn't mind transposing.
<br />However, alter the sounds used or lenghts of notes, or even the melody to save a couple of bytes will end up probably a bad idea, as the song won't sound as it was intended. As this isn't dramatic, in the long run it can be a lot of trouble to save a couple of bytes who will keep empty at the end of the ROM anyways.

<br />
<br />The musician in me says to let the song be heard how it was written and intended to be heard. A song will sound pretty different when it's played lower or higher in the chord structure than it was originally written.
<br /> 
<br />On the other hand, it sounds like a great exercise in coding : )
<br />
<br />I'd say back up your files, and do the coding to try and save bytes just to do it as an exercise. I'd expect you wouldn't be as happy with the final product if the music didn't sound right to you any longer.

This way you can experiment with different encodings, and use ones that aren't easy to enter by hand. For example, you could use a format which encoded the delta from the previous note, using fewer bits for small deltas.

I use one byte per note, and I'm pretty sure that's the best I can go. One tyble for tone and one nybble for lenght (higher tones above 12 are reserved for controls). The delta thing seems interesting, as rarely more than one octave of delta is seen, but +- one octave means range -12..+12 which needs at least 5 bits. With only 4 bits we're stuck with -8...+7, which isn't really good, as you'd have a way to go out of this interval, and would require a more complex format to barely save space at all. More importantly, this would be much more pain to convert manually. That wasn't the point anyways.

<br />I guess you're right here. I'm not good with the chord stuff, I usually start with a good melody and then try to put stuff with it that fit well and eventually contine with variants of it. Sometimes on the contrary I start with a baseline and place stuff on the top of it, but I often end up with weird results here. I guess that works pretty well, but this certainly isn't the best one can do.
<br />However, to be honnest, if the song is transposed one or two semitones higher or lower that won't make a really big difference, exept for the insane amount of sharps/flats that will be required to play it (in the case of moving the thing a semitone), which isn't really important since that's no problem for the computer.
<br />And eventually they song will never sound *exactly* as intended as everyone knows no instrument nor synthetiser can reproduce a sound that come close to the NES, you only have to imagine it. However I guess it's good if it sound pretty close to what you wanted.

<br />I think what you're talking about is removing the rests.  I would forget about decay, and do volume envelopes.  The easy way would be to set the volume for each frame (until the envelope loops or ends).  The other way would be to write code that generates them (ADSR - attack, decay, sustain, release), but that's probably only good if you're really want a lot of different envelopes.
<br />
<br />If you kept the rests also, you could for example in the volume envlope have a start, loop, and ending, and the ending would play when the note length ends.

<br />In fact I'm doing it quite differently to both methods you describe. I just made my own method, although it's rather limited (but I wanted it to be simple, I'm thinking of more complex things for my next version of my sound code). It allows to do an attack, and then to decay the note at varied sppeds, but even the fastest speed isn't really fast, because one frame is really a long unit of time when it comes to music/SFX. I wish it would be possible to have a more precise basetime for sound code pratically, but it's not. Unless you have a mapper with IRQs it's hard to do. Of course I could call it twice per frame, one at the beginning and once at the end but that'd be rather weird and won't be a fixed interval between calls. The only thing that can perform faster are hardware sweeps and hardware decays. I can also use hardware decays, but I didn't really use them. I can even use a combination of hardware and software decays, so that the hardware decaying rate is going smaller due to software decay, resulting in a slow-then-fast decaying note. Maybe I could made up something better that can allow notes to be decayed faster ?

<br />A better idea is to just have a transpose command for your format, that lets you move the base around. Essentially, you remap c-&gt;C to say, e-&gt;E, and thus stay within the octave.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah it wasn't that long ago.
<br />
<br />Anyway, I've noted there is no way to really save a significant amount of bytes by transposing. Where you save a few octave crosses on one place, you'll automatically waste a considerable amount of them at another place of the tune, so there is hardly an "ideal" scale for a tune so that it have minimal octave crosses. Unless you make a programm that searches this, there is no way to tell which scale would be better, so overall it's better to just avoid transposing. (since most people seems to think key is important).
<br />
<br />On one other hand if you try to "guess" which key a tune you know well will be played before you actually play it, chances are that you were completely wrong (or at least for me).

<br />
<br />Picture a system, where notes are packed into 8 bits, 4 bit tone, 4 bit length/cmd. 
<br />
<br />Tone 0-E would pass through, F would indicate a rest.
<br />lengths 0-C would refer to whatever set you wanted at the time, they aren't important. length D would be octave down, length E octave up, length F would be an escape for lengthier commands.
<br />
<br />Tones that pass through are offsets from a base tone, the sum of which is the actual absolute tone played (0-128). Octave up and down just add or subtract 12 to that base.
<br />
<br />What I was talking about would be the case of an extended command, that could set the tone base to anything, thus giving you compact access to any contiguous stretch of 14 notes in the scale.

<br />That would be why bloopageddon has *another* extended command telling it how many bits are note, and how many are length. Length goes through a lookup table, and for repeated sequences, can apply a per-note macro to *that*.
<br />
<br />It carved the command escape out of note range for commands though, as length wasn't guaranteed to exist, since you could set the length cutoff to 0. I got bored and moved to other projects while thinking up a redesign.

<br />In simple meters (e.g. 4/4, 2/4, 2/2), my engine would handle triplets the same way Scream Tracker does: with a "delay noteon by x ticks" command. Triplets would be even easier in compound meters such as 6/8, as the row would be an 8th or 16th note.
