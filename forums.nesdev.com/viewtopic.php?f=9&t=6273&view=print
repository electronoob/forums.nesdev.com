Well the NES2 doesn't work good with the RF on a PAL TV, the sound doesn't work at all. Well some sound come through while using the RF and fine tuning, but that quality is so bad so it's even better without it!<br /><br />Could the problem be that we use a PAL TV? Seems strange when the same TV works with with the first version of NES (both American and European) and also the AV Famicom...  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>
<br />Well I just ran into the same problem. The toploader I just imported from the US have perfectly working video (contrary to all people complaining abou it being bad... it looks really much better than on my PAL NES the dot crawl is much less noticeable and the colors blend into others much better).
<br />The sound however is not working, junk comes out of the speakers. The only exeption seems FF3 where I can hear vague correct sound that is out-louded by white noise and 60Hz junk. I am glad I am not the first one to run into that problem but... that don't explain what is the source of the problem. I tried it on both channel 3 and 4 and the same problem appears.
<br />
<br />I don't know if I'm supposed to use the NTSC RF switch, but I opened it and it looked identical to PAL RF switches, only the connectors being different. The problem is the same whenever I use an RF switch or directly conntect NES to the TV; however with my PAL NES and SNES I have to use the switch (even if there is no other RF device) else there is noise on the picture (whch is weird). Maybe some resistors or capacitors have different values on NTSC and PAL switches, and this is what kills the thing ?
<br />
<br />I really wish I could open the NES but I can't because of those f***ing secured screws which are bigger than those found on cartridges (which I can deal with no problem).
<br />
<br />So it's nice to have a NTSC NES to test my programs on NTSC mode and to play actual games faster (hey it doesn't even have a CIC so almost all my PAL games works fine in it), but with no sound it kinda kills it...
<br />
<br />PS : Another thing that surprised me with the NTSC NES was that there is undocumented BG color borders on left and right of the image, even when the BG left clipping is disabled. For example on the world map of FF3, there is green left and right borders. Those don't happen on a PAL NES nor on any emulator I've ever seen.

I have a couple PAL clone systems that have RF out (of course 99% of the time I use the A/V instead), but I vaguely remember the picture being monchrome and having no sound.  The SNES one (Gamestation), kevtris helped me out by swapping an NTSC RF box into it when we had it taken apart, then it was fine.  Same RF box as the one from an NES.  I forget what it looks like inside the toploader though.
<br />
<br />Maybe you got lucky have a later revision.  The one I have has prominent bars that are really noticeable if you're on a full blank grey screen or something bright like that.
<br />
<br />The accessory included with the PAL FC clone I have was really neat though, it's an antenna that plugs into the RF out, and receiver for the TV's RF in.  I don't think the FCC would approve, heheh.

<br />Reminds me of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrOdnNTp4JM" class="postlink">Master System Super Compact</a>, that was made by TecToy and sold here in Brazil. I got one of those, the D-Pad sucks.

<br />
<br />I think it's pretty clear the problem is inside the RF modulator in the console but I really don't understand : Why the same modulator would work fine in america and won't work in europe ? There is absolutely no reason or does it have to do with other waves interfering with it which aren't present in america ? Even that doesn't make any sense - I believe the modulator is the exact same and uses the same frequencies as the one in the PAL consoles, the only difference is that a NTSC video signal is modulated instead of a PAL video signal.
<br />
<br />The only difference in the NES' side is that it is powered by 9V AC 50 Hz instead of 9V AC 60 Hz... would that make any difference ?
<br />
<br />Another explaination would that something inside the console would have been broken while it was shipped here, but it was obviously packaged with a lot of care with those bubbles everywhere I don't think any damage to the console could have been done.
<br />
<br />As I said above I can't take away the secure screws - I was able to remove one screw with pliers, but I still have 4 other screws which don't want to move - they even got pretty damaged and the most they are damaged the least chances I have to be able to eventually remove them  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />

<br />
<br />Unfortunately, not true: In NTSC, the audio signal is FM modulated at 4.5 MHz above baseband, and in PAL it's modulated at 5.5 MHz. I would have assumed your PAL TV that can take NTSC video in could also do the correct demodulation of audio, but maybe I'm wrong?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh this could explain things. I don't think they made PAL or NTSC TVs anymore, they just make them worldwide universal (or does they ?). My TV let me chose between 4 audio decoding systems : SC1 (which works for the PAL (S)NES), SC2, SC3 and F. No idea what this means, but neither of those works. I can get some audio trough the noise in FF3, and ONLY in FF3 (which is really weird), with SC1. F also kills the video which is weird.
<br />
<br />And I can confirm switches are identical in NTSC and PAL countries. The only difference is the mechanics of the connectors. I don't know if it recognize a signal producted by the console, but I doubt. The switch is optional for the NTSC console - the image works fine without it (but sound doesn't work no matter what). For the PAL console, the image is noisy without the switch (which is werid).
<br />
<br />Also all my problems does not depends on the power supply - I tried an alternate 8.5V DC supply and it is the same as when using the 9V AC supply.

<br />Additionally, you should consider grabbing a 4.5mm external head line security tool for your consoles, as these are both inexpensive and easily purchased on-line.

<br />Good idea but importing anything from USA for me means $30 shipping + $30 import taxes = around $60 plus price of the item.
<br />
<br />I don't know how easy security tools are purchased, I'd sure like to get one but I'm afraid it's not that easy.

<br />I got mine off of ebay, but I know MCM Electronics was selling them.  I don't have the part # on hand, but try a search for "gamebit 4.5mm"
