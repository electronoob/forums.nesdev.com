My opinion would be that none of them will help you in what you're looking for:  both of them will teach you <strong>how</strong> to learn about what you want to do by showing you the basics but it will not teach you what you may want to do.<br /><br />Basically, once you've learned enough from school, the rest lies in your hand and your own determination. No school will help you on that. So if your goal is just to do it as a hobby then you can learn it by yourself actually, a school is not necessary.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3559">Banshaku</a> — Thu Oct 15, 2009 6:22 pm</p><hr />

A great book that will teach you the fundamentals of assembly language programming in the clearest, most down to earth way imaginable is Jeff Duntemann's Assembly Language: Step by Step. This teaches x86 assembly; so this would be a roundabout way of learning another processor like 6502. But, it is the background I came from and I can easily say that what I learned from that book made it very easy to learn 6502.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3735">GradualGames</a> — Thu Oct 15, 2009 1:14 pm</p><hr />

I can confirm what Tokumaru says, I don't think there's anything that really prepares you for assembly other than learning other languages first.  Once you have a basic understanding of loops, if/thens, structures etc. you will have an easier time reconstructing these actions on a more basic level.<br /><br />College teaches either beginner stuff you can find on Google, or the forms and database management of typical business apps.<br /><br />Video game schools teach things like collision detection and the advanced structures needed for complex games, but nowadays I would expect them to mostly be based around modern languages and 3D engines.<br /><br />For assembly, your best bet is forums like this one!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3438">UncleSporky</a> — Thu Oct 15, 2009 3:53 am</p><hr />

Having studied Computer Science for 4 years, the only assembly I saw over there was in Computer Architecture classes. It didn't help much though, I learned much more from the internet.<br /><br />I'm not really sure how it is with Computer Engineering, but I guess they'd focus more on the architecture of processors, which should mean looking into some assembly, but maybe they aren't as focused in programming logic.<br /><br />Whatever you choose, don't expect to learn how to program games in college. Every programming course nowadays (excluding those specific to games) will only focus on basic logic operations while the students are first learning how to program, and the advanced classes will be all about modern application crap: forms, databases, reports and that kind of shit. most programmers have no clue on how to make a real-time interactive program such as a game.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Wed Oct 14, 2009 8:07 pm</p><hr />
