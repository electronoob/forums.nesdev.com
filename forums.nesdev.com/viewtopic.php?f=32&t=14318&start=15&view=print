Those were just quick paintovers is all.<br /><br />regarding skirts:<br />I reckon as long as you're classier than Capcom, it'd be fine. Since the outfits are very clearly real-world school uniform-inspired, and when real-world students (who would wear those uniforms) would typically wear a different uniform for playing sports, the decision stood out to me.<br /><br />Also, if you're not tied to the implication of school-age students, you could take something like American Gladiator contender-uniforms into consideration. (which I think Windjammers was pretty close to, anyway).<br /><br /><img src="http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2008/06/20/american-gladiators-20080620041920249-2441349_320w.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Did you have a specific setting in mind?<br /><br />Are the players representing their countries? (The American Super Dodgeball)<br />Is it a school-club sport? (The Japanese Super Dodgeball, what I had assumed from the first shot)<br />Is there a scifi element to it? (Discs of Tron, Base Wars)<br />Is it a street-sport? (Street Hoop/Slam)<br />Are they battling for fantasy realms? (Mortal Kombat)<br /><br />Deciding on this first could inspire the outfits of choice.<br /><br />Edit: Punctuation/Grammar

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Windjammers has much more of a &quot;rough future arena sport&quot; vibe to it with regards to costumes than I was planning. I like how in many fighting games, the characters clearly didn't show up having dressed ready to fight. They are just there, as-is, working with what they have. So, variety in what players are wearing can be justified in that regard. However, I don't think it's a hugely important topic. I don't wish to justify a costume based on strange edge-cases, but basing what characters wear on P.E. uniforms, typical Tennis wear, and other various sporty things is reasonable. Street clothes are certainly accessible given the somewhat ambiguous social situation. <br /><br />If Windjammers is Soccer/Futbol, then my game is the equivalent of a pick-up game being played on a public court. There will be <em>no long-winded story</em> fleshing out <em>who</em> is playing, <em>why</em> they are playing, and what the stakes are for the game. The characters do not have faces because I would like them to remain abstract representations of a player having inserted himself or herself into the game at most.<br /><br />In redrawing the character art, I've done some more CHR-RAM packing. For the twelve frames of animation I have now (3 frames x 4 directions) I've still got some space to go in my 16x7 window. I'll need that to fit in some sort of animation for the dash, holding and throwing animations for the disc, and a &quot;powering up&quot; animation. <br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IpkQdvB.png" alt="Image" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can dig that. The informal feel of street sports games has appeal. I loved the aforementioned Street Slam for MVS and have never been able to enjoy a uniformed-team basketball game. For similar spritework, you might want to check out Street Sports Basketball for the C64.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.gb64.com/Screenshots/S/Street_Sports_Basketball.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Edit:<br />Oh, and don't be hesitant to use black-as-clothing as well. It could help break up some of the monotony of shorts and t-shirts.<br /><br />I put these together yesterday (before you replied about setting), inspired by 90s athletic gameshow contestant fashion (gladiators, guts, etc.). <br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">

	</div><br />I'm not suggesting it, just posting it as an example of using black to vary the clothing. Could help keep interest without devoting two sprite palettes per player (could free up a sprite palette for the disc in case you ever wanted it to flash or flame-up or anything.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On the bus home from work I drew some animations for sliding forward and blocking, and hooked them up to the appropriate triggers. diagonal and up/down sliding just point to other animations for now because it lets me see that the logic works. I also made a few playfield changes, going for asphalt for the first stage. I ran it through the <s>vomit</s> NTSC filter to ensure reasonable visibility too, and am experimenting with alternate ways of displaying the score to respect NTSC safe zones. <br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lO8i59J.png" alt="Image" />

It seems like it's a pretty cool game, I want to see how your take on that game is going to be so please finish it ok?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br />I like your art overall but the sliding sprite feels off for some reason. Anyway, judging from the &quot;original&quot; game this seems like a pretty fun one, best of luck.
