I'd love to replace my ageing LPT-based programmer.<br /><br />I should note the model I'm looking for should also support PIC programming (which is usually done via a module/adapter, which is totally fine/cool by me).

But I was recommending the brand really, if the VP-280 is good I'm sure the other ones are as well, it's just a matter of picking the one that has support for the chips you need.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tried to go the cheap rout with a US$50 Willem, and I surely regret that. The programmer did work, but it was not very reliable. The hard part was getting the computer to recognize it, but when that happened it worked fine. There was also the annoyance of having to setup switches and jumpers depending on the part you're programming. The Wellon is great because it just works. Plug it in, select the chip in the software and you're ready to go. It also has more features than the Willem had, like being able to identify unknown chips, and test known chips (like logic gates and memories).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I also like that the VP-290 has a auto-write mode for writing the same image to a number of chips. It detects when the chip is seated correctly and starts writing. That could come in handy if I try to self-publish.
