<br />
<br />Anyway I've been playing this on and off for the past few days and got pretty good.  I'm trying REALLY hard to get a gold in everything --  I want to see if you get anything special.  I kind of doubt it -- all I really expect is like a "thanks for playing" screen.  That would be so typical of an NES game  XD.
<br />
<br />Here are my top scores!  (I'm using savestates to remember due to the actual game not saving your data).  Listed in order of song difficulty:
<br />
<br />50450 (G) - The Way You Make Me Feel
<br />51150 (G) - Sweet Child of Mine
<br />50275 (G) - Swing of Things
<br />47600 (S) - Harder Better Faster Stronger
<br />
<br />Has anyone got a gold in everything?  Anybody else play this game?  What kind of scores can you guys get?

<br />
<br />I played it a few times but I'm terrible at it.
<br />
<br />Couldn't you cheat the score to check if there was a prize for winning Gold in all songs?

<br />
<br />I hear you.  I totally understand.  Actually, I've never cheated a game in an emulator unless the goal was reverse-engineering- or romhacking- related (usually the former).
<br />
<br />You're so close to getting the gold in the last song that cheating now should be criminal.  I'm rooting for you! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I'm going to give it another shot.  Do you play with a controller or with the keyboard?

<br />I have a PSX-&gt;USB adaptor I bought like 6 years ago.
<br />
<br />And thanks for rooting for me!  =D

<br />-------------------
<br />EDIT
<br />
<br />
<br />Wooo just got it!  53075
<br />
<br />It's exactly what I thought!  It shows a newspaper that says "You Rock", and at the bottom it says "Thanks for playing"
<br />
<br />Also in classic NES form, it just plays music and doesn't let you escape the screen.  You have to reset to get out of it  XD

<br />
<br />But now that we know what happens where would be the fun in it? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />
