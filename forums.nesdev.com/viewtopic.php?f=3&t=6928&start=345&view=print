Just rename punes32.exe to punes32_p.exe or punes64.exe to punes64_p.exe if you have the x64 version.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for your continuing work on this. I have the following suggestions: 1) &quot;pause emulation when inactive&quot; / &quot;run in background&quot; option; 2) ability to load external palette files. The current PAL palette may be accurate, but it's really bland / washed out compared to what I see on my PAL TV; 3) support for more mappers. For example, 200-in-1-Elfland dump currently seems unsupported; 4) in Windows XP keyboard input works fine only if English is set as a &quot;default input language&quot;. When Russian is set as a &quot;default input language&quot; I can successfully assign &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to alphabetical keyboard buttons (they appear as Latin, not Cyrillic, characters in your &quot;Standard Pad setup&quot; window, which is OK) and play a game, but, no matter what I do, when starting puNES again, these buttons are not saved and appear unassigned.
