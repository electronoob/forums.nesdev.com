Otherwise, I dunno, maybe there's somebody here you can mail it to that would like to take on the challenge. I think I could do it, and it would be a fun challenge, but my interest in this is only at the spectator level.<br /><br />I'm a little curious, though, how come you have a CopyNES? I presume you didn't buy and install it just to try and dump this one cartridge. It sounds like you don't do NES programming. What use do you get out of it?<br /><br />Edit: ah yeah, lidnariq makes a good point, if it's just discrete parts in there it might be decipherable just from looking at it. I was thinking of RetroUSB's MMC style repros which have a CPLD on there that requires much more than visual inspection.</div><br /><br />I originally bought the USBCopyNES to dump just one game, the predecessor of the game I am trying to dump now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. A friend of mine who teaches technology installed it for me.  I have hacked and cracked a lot of things, but always using guides.  I have no real talent for figuring this stuff out on my own.<br /><br />I can take some pics and share them later this evening, or perhaps mail the cart to a trusted member of this forum who has an interest in the project.

Yeah, using both address and data lines would require preventing bus conflicts, but that's not that hard if you're making custom PCBs.<br /><br />If it isn't standard oversize UxROM, it'll require modifying the emulator or ROM, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well it does say UNROM 512 right on the board. The only thing else is the board appears to support banking CHR-RAM. But looking at the jumpers it appears it's likely just 512kbyte unrom style. You could certainly dump it with CopyNES or TapeDump. Dump $C000-$FFFF and find the table for avoiding bus conflicts and then alter the plugin that would bank each piece in to write to this table and you're set.

I have a hacker solution for you.  Lift the A18 pin (referenced from the flash chip's datasheet) on the PRG-ROM from the PCB.  Connect it to GND. Dump it as UOROM 256KB (that's your lower half).  Disconnect from GND, connect to Vcc, dump again.  Remove the header from the second dump and append to the first.  Adjust remaining header to 512KB and enjoy.  Reconnect the lifted pin if desiring to replay on the NES.<br /><br />No soldering iron?  I have an even bigger hacked solution for you.  Take it even further with a slightly less approved no-solder method.  Scrounge the drawers for a paperclip (a metal one).  Take the cover off you NES &amp; cart so you can access the PCB (PRG-ROM specifically) while dumping.  For the few seconds it takes to dump, short the A18 pin to Gnd with your paperclip &amp; dump.  Short to Vcc and dump again.  Create file as directed above.  Sure this option stresses your A18 OR gate output driver a little, but if it's only for a min or less it should be just fine.  Put your thumb on the OR gate(s)  for a temporary little heat sink. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
