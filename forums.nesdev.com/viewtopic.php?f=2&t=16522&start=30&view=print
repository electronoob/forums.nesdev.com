Your evidence that /IRQ was asserted at pixel 315 had more in common with proving that a soccer pitch was 86 meters long because you assumed that your measuring tape was accurate. When we pointed out that the rule book said &quot;it's 100m&quot;, you denied it, and ultimately required that I <em>go and find your measuring tape and show that it wasn't trustworthy</em>.<br /><br />Your proof wasn't &quot;hard&quot;. It was about as squishy as possible. But you <em>assumed</em> it was correct and when someone told you you were wrong <em>you didn't reevaluate your assumptions</em>.

I checked my calculations after those posts, and found they were correct. I also checked the Scrolling page, and found no indication the effect would be delayed (this is now fixed thanks to tepples).

That would have same the same end result <em>without</em> being combative.<br /><br />Do you really not understand why I'm harping on <em>humility</em>? It's not like this is the first time that your demeanor of &quot;I'm the smartest most infallible human and everyone else is an idiot&quot; has annoyed me; it's just the first time where I knew it was trivially wrong.
