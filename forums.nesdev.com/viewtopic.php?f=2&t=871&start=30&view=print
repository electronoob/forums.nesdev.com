This looks like NES emulation as taken another leap in accuracy.  Is anything like this necessary for audio?</div>
<br />This seems like it's heading offtopic and should move to another thread instead of continuing here further.  I'll reply for now though.
<br />
<br />The audio possibility is something I thought of too while reading this thread but I was going to wait until the video stuff is released before mentioning it.  Yes, this kind of thing could be done for audio too, and it'd probably be cool to eventually see the video and audio together for super-authentic emulation.  People have already done that kind of audio processing before, though perhaps not in emulation, and I don't remember exactly where (I remember seeing the proper processing as part of a set which also included an option to encode to telephone encoding and back again).  Finding someone's implementation which takes a wav file may be as easy as doing a search for both the particular spec which the NES uses to send audio to the TV (those kind of jibberish standards body numbers) and source.
<br />
<br />As for connecting to a TV.. Though I'm not an expert, I suspect that if you hook up high-quality outputs to a high-quality TV you could get a result which is worth using.  There's no benefit over the PC though (Edit: A non-composite interlacing mode would be best to use on TV's.  I think TV's would have an advantage there).  It's worth pointing out that you'd want to avoid using a composite connection, because otherwise you'd be applying an extra layer of artifacting that would further mess with the emulation's output.  Unfortunately I'm not aware of any way to bypass a PC's (or any console's) video output hardware and output your own raw values (perhaps this is what you were thinking?).  If you're very hardcore, you could in theory create a hardware/software solution which could output your own software-processed NTSC signal from the PC <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.. but I think it'd be difficult and not usable by many people.
<br />
<br />I'll add that the video processing screenshots look insanely cool <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I don't know of any way to force a TV-out to skip the extra half-scanline that triggers sets to interlace, so that sounds like the best one could get.

I was expecting horizontal scrolling to result in the "comb" effect due to interlace, but didn't see any, though it might be due to the flicker-reduction filter that the video output has. I don't have a TV with S-Video inputs so I can't try that with my modified NES emulator that does NTSC emulation. I'm hoping to post a Win32 build of it and source code sometime soon.

<br />It works quite well, and you can get non-interlaced output out of a PC. I think windows/dos/linux ports exist.

<br />So does the GameCube. In the case of the GameCube, the game can turn on and off a [1 2 1]/4 line convolution kernel that the RAMDAC applies to each component before encoding it in video.

<br />This mini-discussion was about displaying emulator output on a TV using PC video cards that only output an interlaced signal, and how negatively it affected the result as compared to the non-interlaced output of a NES.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Wouldn't the ideal accurate NES emulator try to get video output to a TV to look the same as the NES's video output to the same TV?  Does anybody have the ability to capture the NES's video output and compare it against the video output coming out of the TV out of a computer?  Would a TV tuner card be an accurate way to capture clips of video or do TV tuner cards introduce too many artifacts of their own, to be able to be a tool for objectively measuring the accuracy of video emulation?  
<br />
<br />What I am getting at is, lets get straight to the point and start posting screen captures of emulation video sent out on, composite, S-video, and component, side-by-side compared to the NES's composite video.  That way everybody can see how close emulation can get the video to look like when displayed on a TV.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You have identified two main targets for emulation: casual emulation using the PC monitor and speakers, and hard-core emulation using a TV. The main point of this thread has been the former, making the image on a computer monitor look close to what you see on a TV.
<br />
<br />Hard-core emulation on a TV can be taken as far as generating the raw NTSC composite signal using a high-speed DAC. On the old boards someone was talking about taking this route. This seems the best way to go if you want to use a TV, since otherwise it might be very difficult to ensure that your emulator-&gt;RGB-&gt;PC video card-&gt;NTSC-&gt;TV matches NES-&gt;TV, due to the PC video card unknowns.

Higher resolutions can be offered in fullscreen, but they're pretty much useless for TV-out. Sure, it won't be 100% accurate, but with S-Video or better, you won't have any additional artifacts on top of the emulated NES artifacts.
