		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm trying to build a controller detector circuit based on a current shunt resistor on each controller's Vcc line (high-side current sense circuit), but to figure out the math, I need to know the max current draw to expect on each port's supply line.  I already measured the current draw of a single OEM gamepad, and it's about 300 microamps during normal gameplay, but that's a single gamepad.  I'm sure other peripherals have higher draw.  At the very least, a fully-loaded multitap should be roughly 4x that.  Maybe something like a light gun or one of the IR wireless receivers might have a higher draw, I don't know.  I'll be testing everything I have, but my SNES accessory collection is far from comprehensive...  If nothing else, I'll probably assume a max of 10-100mA or something on the high end like that, but I'd like to get some real numbers if at all possible.  The circuit works fine even if I estimate too high, it just wastes power and drops the controller's Vcc a bit, but better numbers up front means less chance for problems down the road.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The SNES mouse is rated 50mA.<br />The Multitap is rated max 17mA per slot. That would be 68mA for all 4 slots (plus the power consumtion of the Multitap itself, so it might be around 70...100mA in total).<br />That are the official ratings, I don't know how far the actual hardware is following those values.<br />Nintendo appears to have been strict about not to exceed that ratings, but unlicensed controllers might be completely ignoring those limits.

Non-optical mice will be much lower, but making it clear to the user that they need to use a crappy cheap ball mouse might be difficult. A random source claims that the original PS/2 port has a fast-blow single-time fuse set to 275mA, although later ones at least used a polyfuse instead.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now that I think about it some more, I don't really need to know the maximum current so long as the shunt resistor is small enough as to not limit the current below that amount.  I don't need to design the current sense circuit around the max current because all I care about is the minimum threshold, and anything above that doesn't matter.  Higher current = higher voltage drop across the sense resistor = higher output from the current sense monitor... however, the current sense monitor, being a real, non-ideal amplifier, should clip the output to the supply rail, so really all that matters is the MINIMUM current draw, because the maximum is likely to be 2, if not 3 orders of magnitude larger than the minimum, so there's no way to fit the maximum within a linear amp range, but I don't have to because of the clipping.  The differential input voltage will be in the millivolt range, and the common-mode voltage is 5V, so that's all within reasonable specs.  I have it hooked up and it's working, only problem now is that I'm getting a nasty voltage spike on the output pin at power-on and immediately after connecting the controller, roughly twice the supply voltage, which I didn't think was possible, since the amp should be clipping at the supply voltage.  10V spikes into a microcontroller ADC pin probably isn't going to go over very well...  I'm really not a fan of analog problems... :/
