		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What's been said is for the most part correct, but we're basing it on experience from the late 80s/early 90s, which is over 20 years ago.  Cut people some slack!  :-)<br /><br />In my experience the sleeves with the red &quot;Nintendo&quot; branding were only used on games which were both 1) made by Nintendo and 2) published by Nintendo.  All other games (including games made by other companies but published by Nintendo) used black sleeves with no red &quot;Nintendo&quot; branding.<br /><br />That said, here's something to keep in mind:<br /><br />Kids usually stopped caring which games used what sleeves after a few months of time.  E.g. you'd play 10 games in an afternoon, and when you were done you've just shove whatever game into whatever sleeve.  Any NES game you buy today would be subject to that.<br /><br />Furthermore, keep in mind that games sold as &quot;new! unopened!&quot; may have actually been opened at some point (but kept in very very good condition) -- do you know how inexpensive shrink wrap guns + shrink wrap plastic (polyolefin film, a.k.a. POF) are?  Try US$60 for the gun and US$50 for 1500 feet of 18&quot; wide POF.  It's pocket change for someone who sells tons of crap on eBay.  I've even bought games from local outfits (similar to GameStop for example) where the games/boxes/etc. are shrinkwrapped (to imply they're &quot;new&quot;, but if you ask you'll be told &quot;it could be new, sure! But it's probably used&quot;).<br /><br />Here's my question to you: why does it matter, or is this just another case of NES Spergelording?

Although I wouldn't lose sleep about when I couldn't get the correct sleeves. But since I can order all that stuff easily, why not use the cases that were intended for the various games?
