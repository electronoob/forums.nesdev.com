		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm currently in the early stages of programming an NFL football game. I plan to make a better version of Tecmo Super Bowl that modernizes the game and includes better graphics, gameplay, and options. As it stands, I am using MMC3 mapper 004. I am looking for the best mapper for this project, preferably one that incorporates CHR RAM which I have never used before. I see that TQROM mapper 119 has both CHR ROM and CHR RAM but only 128 PRG and 64 CHR. This will not be enough. I will need something close to 128 KiB for field graphics alone. I want CHR RAM so I can animate players more smoothly and create pixel-by-pixel tile effects on objects like the flags that hang on the goal posts.<br /><br />What mapper would you suggest? Should I consider MMC5 or MMC6?

Or you could use TGROM modded to take a 62256 (32 KiB SRAM), which allows both tile animation and arbitrary updating.<br /><br />But what in your project needs MMC3? Could it get away with something simpler like BNROM (Deadly Towers, Haunted Halloween '85) or MMC1 SGROM/SNROM (too many to list)?

(Mappers 74, 191, 192, 194, 195)<br /><br />For manufacturability, I think the best option is to just use a large CHR-RAM (128KiB ones are easily purchased currently) and upload all the graphic data from PRG-ROM instead.<br /><br />Note that if emulator compatibility is an objective, that will preclude anything not explicitly in <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/MMC3_with_CHR_ROM_and_CHR_RAM" class="postlink">this list</a>.

The two endzones and the midfield graphics combine to 4K per team. So for all 32 teams that is 128K of data best suited for CHR ROM. I want each tile to be drawn separately for each football player with help from CHR RAM to allow more animations to run at the same time. These fields will look great. Lastly, I want to add a few finishing touches that only can be done with CHR RAM.

If not, it makes much more sense to upload the field graphics to CHR-RAM when each game starts than to use something as unconventional as CHR-ROM + CHR-RAM. And you can also animate small background elements the same way you animate the players.

I haven't thought of all the possibilities yet of how I want to update the PPU. There is at least one full screen of space after the endzone fully comes off screen to when the midfield logo appears so CHR ROM is great for this because of the bank switching but not totally necessary. The more I think of it, the better it sounds to have 16384 tiles at my disposal at all times (MMC5). If I have 1024K CHR ROM, which 16384 tiles do I have access to? Is that dictated by my write to $5130? Is that what they mean when it is written regarding $5130:<br />&quot;When the MMC5 is using 2KB/1KB CHR banks, only 512KB/256KB of CHR ROM can be selected using the previous registers. To access all 1024KB in those modes, first write the upper bit(s) to register $5130 and then write the lower bits to $5120-$512B. When the Extended RAM mode is set to 1, this selects which 256KB of CHR ROM is to be used for all background tiles on the screen.&quot;
