<br />
<br />Memblers:
<br />Do you have any plans on adding more to this game, or using the engine itself for something else?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I love that explosion also.  Tootai drew that, and the other animations used, and it was a huge inspiration for what I'd coded there.  Especially my animation control code, it's what I've been using in almost everything I'd made since then.  I would gladly share the source code freely if anyone wants to use that system (it's very flexible as far as frame timing and placing individual 8x8 tiles of each object, like a little scripting thing).
<br />
<br />The font, that's one that I made myself.  Only released program using it must've been the RTC demo.
<br />
<br />And yeah I had plans on adding a lot to the game, actually it's a part of my large-scale ambitious action/strategy game.  It's getting old now, but the code was about as clean as I could write it.  This test was just for the anti-air-defense system, ultimately in the game the plan was that you're a person that can walk around, use different vehicles, and order stuff to be built and have different units to be organized and moved on the 2D map.
<br />
<br />Obviously a lot of the code wasn't written, and I never settled on how precisely to finish the game design itself.  I kept going back-and-forth on which parts of the game were gonna be real-time and which were gonna be turn-based.  It's not easy to design a game with so many elements and keep it balanced.
<br />
<br />But nope, I don't have it up for download because it's barely playable.

<br />
<br />Ah yeah, Missile Command.  That reminds me too that the original idea was that the slow bullets were eventually going to explode when they went as far as the cross hair.  The cross hair can already move inwards and outwards, but I forgot to show that on the video.
