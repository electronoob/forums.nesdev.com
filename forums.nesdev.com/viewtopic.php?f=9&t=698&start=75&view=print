<br />They already have a great Fami-&gt;NES converter.. its called the Honeybee.

<br />I have one, boxed.
<br />
<br />Seems to work fine with every game I've tried (around 15-20)... I have a toaster and a toploader.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It seems that the bigest problem I have noticed with the NES clones (at least with the Yobo and NEX), is the sound.  It seems like it would be a fixable problem, too.  From what I hear coming out of the clones, the 87.5% and the 25% duty (00 and 11) sound as they should.  However, it seems the 75% and 50% duty (01 and 10) are playing the opposite of what they should (ie something programmed to output a 75% duty pulse, would output a 50% duty pulse).  Put more simply, it sounds like they reverse the bits that control the duty cycling of the pulse channels.  This would also explain how some things sound more accurate than others do.  Would there be a way electronicaly to check what register it's accessing, and during writes to the sound registers that control duty, reverse those 2 bits?  If such a mod could be done, I think many of the sound glitches would be fixed.

<br />
<br />That is the most immediately recognizeable problem with NESClones, probably attributable to an error during the chip's original design.  The fabricators did not intimately know the NES hardware and the producers probably did not know NESsound well enough to spot the error.  Its not unlikely that they did and decided to ignore it, being a small error that could cost alot to track down.  
<br />
<br />But this is good news, because it implies that these NESClones can be fixed with minimal effort.  It also tends to refute the argument that designing a truly accurate NOAC is economically unfeasible.  Its not like you have to reinvent the wheel from scratch, you can take an existing design and make it better.

<br />
<br />If it works, patent the mod and sell it to Messiah.  Honestly, you might as well get paid for improving their product.
