		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There's a function called &quot;Cartlist to File&quot; in no$sns &quot;Utility&quot; menu. The feature was intended to get an idea of how many cartridges use this or that ROM and RAM sizes, and this or that controllers, and such things.<br />I've asked somebody some months ago if he could run the function on a big collection of ROM images... but he never got around to that.<br /><br />So, maybe somebody else could give a try? Preferably on a huge collection of ROMs (including japanese ones, copier BIOSes, bootlegs, unlicensed games, and whatever exotic stuff that might exist).<br /><br />Copy all ROM images into a single folder, unzip them if needed, and rename all files to .smc externsion. Then load one of ROMs into no$sns (just to get it looking at the desired folder), then run the Cartlist function in Utility menu. A progress bar should show up, and then you'll have to wait a while; mostly depending on the speed of your harddisk. Results are saved in file &quot;Allcarts.log&quot; (in the no$sns directory).<br /><br />The log file contains the title, filename, rom/ram sizes, chipset, portions of the header (and extended header if present), and some controller flags:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">M&nbsp; Mouse<br />5&nbsp; Multi5<br />S&nbsp; SuperScope<br />L&nbsp; Lasabirdie<br />T&nbsp; Turbo File (STF-mode)<br />t&nbsp; Turbo File (TFII-mode)<br />K&nbsp; Xband Keyboard<br />V&nbsp; Voice-Kun<br />B&nbsp; Barcode Battler<br />J&nbsp; Justifier<br />m&nbsp; M.A.C.S.<br />E&nbsp; Exertainment<br />W&nbsp; Twin Tap<br />P&nbsp; Miracle Piano<br />p&nbsp; Pachinko Dial<br />N&nbsp; NTT Data Pad<br />n&nbsp; NTT JRA PAT SFC Modem<br />C&nbsp; SFC-Box Coin Input<br />U&nbsp; Unknown (START OF xxx BIOS)</div><br />maybe that will help to find some more games support exotic controllers. If you PM/email the log file to me would be nice (or post it here if you want to). If the cartlist function should happen to crash would be also good to know (just in case my cartloader doesn't work on same games).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am doing that for you right now but the cartlist function keep making the emu crash. It seem to crash once it reach certain roms. It will crash with Mega Man X2 and X3 (as a matter of fact, no$sns crash with ''NO$SNS FATAL: unexpected error'' if I try to play run those games) and also crash on Mick &amp; Mack giving ''NO$SNS FATAL: Mick &amp; Mack as the global gladiators (U) (Beta) [1829].sav'' (that game is playable on the emu though). I separated each of the problematic rom from the rom folder and was able to complete the cartlist. <br /><br />Here's the log (without Mega Man X2/X3 and Mick &amp; Mack BETA):<br /><a href="http://skinnyv.com/misc/ALLCARTS.LOG" class="postlink">http://skinnyv.com/misc/ALLCARTS.LOG</a>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Many thanks! The three crashes should be already working (in current/still unreleased version), the Megaman games crashed when trying to display a CX4 BIOS not found message, and Mick and Mack is prototype with bad header (claiming to need &quot;1 SHL AEh&quot; kbytes SRAM, which is now clipped to a more reasonable size).<br /><br />The log was interesting. First thing I noticed have been the two games with unknown &quot;START OF xxx BIOS&quot; controller ID strings... what could that be... &quot;START OF HELICOPTER BIOS&quot;, maybe? Ah, no, more boring: &quot;START OF JOY BIOS&quot; (which turns out to be just some sort of headline for the following MULTI5 stuff). And, in the other game, &quot;START OF MULTI% BIOS&quot;, hmmm, that seems to mean &quot;MULTI5&quot;, but with bit4 cleared in the &quot;5&quot;, making it a &quot;%&quot; sign, dunno if that's been done intentionally, or the bit got damaged by mistake.<br /><br />Another odd thing is that Mario Paint Prototype is detected to have OBC1 coprocessor - but, I guess it's just due to a bad header in the prototype.<br /><br />For DSP1 games, I didn't knew that there are two different Ballz 3D versions (3 Jigen Kakutou Ballz, and Ballz 3D), and Hanguk Pro Yagu... I didn't knew that one, too. Ah, no, I did already knew it: as &quot;Korean League&quot;.<br /><br />Then there's &quot;Cannondale Cup&quot; supporting the Exertainment Bike? Seems to be just a different version of Mountain Bike Rally. Cannondale Cup is in fact sending exertainment packets... doing the usual login (including for checking for the &quot;LIFEFITNES(s)&quot; string), but it doesn't actually seem to react to the analog biking speed, and doesn't display any exertainment hardware related things.<br />Don't know if or how the game supports the bicycle hardware (maybe it just doesn't like how I've emulated the hardware in no$sns).<br /><br />Then there are a some &quot;new&quot; Barcode Battler games:<br />- Donald Duck no Mahou no Boushi<br />- Lupin Sansei - Densetsu no Hihou wo Oe! (J)<br />- Amazing Spider-Man, The - Lethal Foes (J)<br />- Doraemon 4 - Nobita to Tsuki no Oukoku (J)<br />Just noticed that some of them were meanwhile/already listed on wikipedia, too.<br /><br />And some &quot;new&quot; Turbo File games:<br />-  TFII: Haisei Mahjong - Ryouga (J)<br />-  TFII: Super Fire Pro Wrestling Special, X, and X Premium (J)<br />-  TFII: Super Robot Taisen Gaiden - Masou Kishin - The Lord of Elemental (J)<br />-  STF: Tower Dream<br />-  STF: Best Shot Pro Golf (J)<br />-  STF: JEWEL OF LIVE (RPG Maker Super Dante) (BS)<br />-  STF: Solid Runner (J)<br />-  STF: Wizardry Gaiden IV - Taima no Kodou (J) (v1.1)   ?<br />-  STF+TFII: Tactics Ogre - Let Us Cling Together (J)<br />Interestingly, unlike most or all other Turbo File games, Tactics Ogre wasn't made by ASCII.<br />And, checking at wikipedia, they have a &quot;new&quot; game, too: Ongaku Tsukuru: Kanadeeru (supports STF mode, plus Satellaview mini FLASH cartridges).<br /><br />And finally, there are 193 mouse games, and 173 multitap games detected in the log file. Until now, I knew about only 70 mouse games, and around 130 multitap games. So there are apparently some more games supporting that hardware, but merging them with my existing lists (and verifying if they are really working) would a lot of work... I guess I'll avoid to that.
