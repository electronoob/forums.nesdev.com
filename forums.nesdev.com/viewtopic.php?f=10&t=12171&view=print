		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright, so I've gradually begun to understand more and more about 6502. I understand sprites, how to make them move, all that.<br />I've learned how to make backgrounds, name tables, attribute tables, and can successfully make a screen resemble something.<br /><br />So now, I'm curious as to how you make multiple screens. I don't necessarily want to try and implement it myself just yet, as it's probably at least somewhat complicated. I'm guessing that, for example if you had 4 screens, you wouldn't have 4 different nametables, so I'd just like to have a general idea of how it's done. Thanks.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The NES only gives you 2 name tables, and that's usually enough to scroll horizontally and vertically as much as you want. You might end up with slight scrolling artifacts around the edges of the screen (e.g. look at the sides of the screen in SMB3 or Kirby's Adventure) depending on how bad you want to hide them, but it's definitely possible to avoid those (look at Jurassic Park, Felix the Cat and Alfred Chicken, for example). Another way to get clean 4-way scrolling is to use add extra RAM to the cartridge and use 4 name tables instead of 2, but not many games did that.<br /><br />Whatever the name table layout you choose, the basic idea is that you draw new parts of the level to areas in the name tables that aren't visible, effectively replacing the parts of the level that were already visited by the player with the parts he hasn't seen yet, right before they scroll into view. This is what tepples' animation is showing.<br /><br />In addition to overwriting the background progressively, you must give your sprites the ability to move in a space bigger than 256x240 pixels. This often means giving them 16-bit coordinates, instead of the newbie-friendly 8-bit. the hard part about this is that the NES can still only place sprites in a 256x240-pixel area, no matter how big your level is. The most professional solution here is to have 2 separate spaces: level space and screen space. Have the game objects move freely in level space using 16-bit coordinates, and convert those coordinates to 8-bit screen coordinates only when generating OAM data. This can be done by subtracting the camera's coordinates (which are also in level space) from the coordinates of the objects.<br /><br />Think about it: if an object is sitting at X coordinate 384, it's in the middle of the second screen of the level. If the camera is at coordinate 0, the object should be completely hidden, because only the first screen is visible. 384 - 0 = 384, which is way past the 256 pixels of an NES screen. As the camera moves right, the distance between it and the object decreases, until that difference less than 256, at which point the object will become visible at the far right of the screen. Once the camera reaches X coordinate 256 (i.e. perfectly aligned to the second screen of the level), 384 - 256 = 128, which is precisely the middle of the screen.<br /><br />It's not such a complex concept once you understand that the NES can only represent a limited space, but with some math you can turn that small space into a &quot;window&quot; that scrolls over a much larger area. That math is basically the conversion between level space and screen/name table space.<br /><br />Of course there are other things to take into consideration, such as spawning enemies (you can't have all the objects of a big level active at all times, there's no memory or CPU for that), but ou shouldn't worry about that until you get the scrolling working.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sorry for double post, but how involved do you think it would be to try and modify the code to work with metatiles? (Right now I just have a 4k BIN file for four screens of a simple level. But obviously I want to try and compress that.) What about for only making the screen move when the player does? (Right now it just scrolls on its own. In the NMI routine, scroll, the variable for what I believe is the position of the camera, just gets incremented.)

Otherwise, don't.</div><br />Keeping the player perfectly centered at all times may feel a bit stiff sometimes. An alternative is to implement a small window (even 32 pixels wide is better) where the player can move without causing the screen to scroll.<br /><br />The basic idea is that the camera follows the player. Like any other game object, the camera should have an AI routine, and in this routine you put the logic that follows the player. The AI for a camera can be very simple: If the player is outside of the window, move the camera (and the window) in the direction that will put the player back in the window. Also check for the boundaries of the level, to prevent the camera from going beyond them.<br /><br />Another good thing about using a window is that you can move this window within the screen, so that when the player is moving right, you can move the window to the left and increase visibility on the right, giving the player more time to react to enemies and obstacles. Once the player stops moving the window goes back to the center.<br /><br />These are just suggestions to improve the behavior of the camera and give players a more dynamic experience, but tepples' suggestion is indeed the most basic thing you can do to get the camera to follow the player.
