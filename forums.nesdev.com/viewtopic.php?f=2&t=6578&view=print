		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, to cut a long introduction short, I'm embarking on another NES tracker. I know, I know. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I've been busy (on and off) rewriting an audio engine from scratch that runs at (so far) 240hz and you can layer up the effects for some pretty weird-sounding stuff.
<br />
<br />Anyway, all that is going well. However, because of the CPU intensiveness of updating the engine 4 times per frame, I'm trying to create an interface that minimises screen updates and data decoding. I think I've got this fairly sussed but one thing I'm struggling with is the design of the music data.
<br />
<br />NTRQ used "fixed" length patterns and while it meant memory handling wasn't necessary, it was also very wasteful (2 bytes per pattern step, even if that step was empty).
<br />
<br />This time I'm wanting to have 2 FX columns plus the note column but I'm going to take a leaf out of LSDJ's book and limit the pattern length to 16 steps so that I don't have to have "scrolling" data.
<br />
<br />This would mean that one pattern, done like NTRQ, would take 80 bytes (1 byte for note, 2 bytes for FX1, 2 bytes for FX2 multiplied by 16 steps = 80)
<br />
<br />My rough memory map allows me 4096 bytes for pattern data (again using 8KB battery RAM) which would only allow me about 50 patterns and that's just not enough.
<br />
<br />So.....(there's a point, yes <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)
<br />
<br />I've been trying to figure out a dynamic memory method to make more efficient use of the battery RAM. Instead of having fixed patterns, in memory they will be tokenised so that, for example, 9 blank steps is represented by one byte, $89, instead of 45 bytes (9 x 5 bytes per step as explained above).
<br />
<br />My idea so far would be to have a edit buffer in main RAM that you decode the pattern to when editing. As you enter editing mode;
<br />
<br />1) Decode the pattern from SRAM to main RAM.
<br />2) Shuffle all the pattern data from the address of the pattern being edited upwards to close the gap (the size of the encoded pattern in SRAM).
<br />3) All edits are performed in the edit buffer in main RAM.
<br />4) If you change patterns or exit edit mode, the pattern in the edit buffer is encoded to SRAM but at the end of existing patterns and it's pointer address is updated accordingly.
<br />
<br />The obvious gotcha is going to be when the limit of the 4096 bytes of pattern RAM are being reached and you're editing patterns low down in the memory - there'll be a lot of data to shuffle upwards before editing can begin.
<br />
<br />Just looking for some advice, optimisation, tips, alternatives etc.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I would like to see some kind of an implementation of <strong>meta-effects</strong>, effects that one could program to "command" other effects and thus create complex sounds with more ease. For example, the user could pre-define a certain single effect letter to abbreviate for a long and thoroughly complex guitar-like-pitch-bending, volume-changing and arpeggio-abusing effect pattern with only a single effect.
<br />
<br />Of course, getting such a feature to run 240 times a second on an old 6502 is most likely not that easy. Perhaps possible for a single, maybe even two, channels, but, I dare say, certainly not possible for every single one.
<br />Then again, as an experienced musician, you most likely already have a brilliant strategy to combat the adversity of having to write down long, repeating sequences.
<br />
<br />To address the matter of limited space, have you considered bankswitched SRAM?

<br />
<br />What emulator are you testing with?  I've learned C recently so maybe I could hack a usable mapper into one of them.  I know the game Genghis Khan uses 16kB SRAM, so hopefully an emu that supports that, as a start.
<br />
<br />A copy of NESten I have will work with 32kB already.  Kind of an older emulator though.

<br />
<br />I've no doubt that a dedicated cart could be built but there are a lot of people using NTRQ on PowerPak and I wouldn't like to alienate those users (as they're probably my whole "market" <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)

<br />
<br />That's actually something I've been interested in for some Verilog practice, a PowerPak mapper, so I'll be a little disappointed if there's not 32kB there.  That'll be later though.  But I'll take a look at Nestopia's source this weekend.  This kind of mapper would be helpful for others too, I believe.

<br />As far as I know, no. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Yeah, it's much more common on C64, probably due to the fact that you have timed IRQs and can set them multiple times per frame.

<br />From reading I'm still pretty sure only MMC5 supports 32Kb of battery-backed RAM (which is what I need). SXROM seems to only have 32kb of volatile RAM which, while handy, is not much use for this application.

<br />There is a couple of boards with SRAM and no slot for a battery (TSROM, JSROM) but that's a minority. They probably made TSROM because it was commonly used enough so that they save board space by removing the TKROM battery slot. Because SMB3 was one of the first MMC3 games, and it was produced in insane quantities, Nintendo made that decision.
