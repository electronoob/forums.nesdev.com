<br />Sorry, I should have said disc.  I was told said story back in late 1997 by a professional game developer (also happened to be my roommate), stating Kojima had done an interview where he explained either game development or consoles -- I can't remember which -- weren't sufficient for what he wanted.  He wanted a 1:1 relationship between the in-game character and the real world; if the game ended, he wanted that to be the end of the game PERIOD, as in you have to go buy another console/copy of the game/whatever.  I'm pretty sure I remember the focus being that he wanted the console itself to explode/burst into flame/whatever.
<br />
<br />I've been scouring the net for the past half hour trying to find said interview but I can't find anything concrete.  I've found a couple references citing Kojima's intense interest in "consequence-based gaming", but this mainly refers to situations where the player does thing X which has Y consequence later in the game.
<br />
<br />I really don't find him to be a genius.  He's just a weird dude.  I always imagine this guy going into his office at Konami at 02:00 in the morning, ripping off all his clothes and slapping his dick against all the PS3 consoles across the company; then going into the nearest bathroom, smashing and tearing down one of the stall dividers, standing horse-stanced (each foot in a separate toilet), and masturbating with a curling iron.  Basically I think he's one step away from becoming a member of Gerogerigegege.

<br />
<br />One could argue that the game leaves a very small margin of error, but it's certainly not unplayable. It's a pretty boring game though. The only positive thing about it is the music.

<br />Because I, like other human beings, lack TAS-class reflexes. You go beat <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23UASifoqdU" class="postlink">Super Mario Bros. Speed Expiation</a> and wrap the score in Balloon Trip in Balloon Fight, and I'll go try to beat Silver Surfer.

Maybe it's all those people who've just watched the AVGN review and never really played the game. But he exaggerates small issues for comedic value, so you can't really take that review as a fair depiction of the difficulty level.

<br />
<br />The only thing that makes it difficult is having to press the A button at lightning speed.  If it autofired or just let you hold A it probably wouldn't be that hard.
<br />
<br />And the walls were no kind of obstacle at all.  At least not on the levels I played.
<br />
<br />EDIT:
<br />
<br />Just enabled Turbo-A and used it.
<br />
<br />Blew through Possessor's level like it was nothing.
<br />
<br />This game isn't that hard.
<br />
<br />EDIT AGAIN:
<br />
<br />Firelord and Metphiso (or whatever his name is) are definately the hardest of the 5.
<br />
<br />But yeah, the difficulty in this game comes from the stupid way you have to shoot.  If you play with Turbo it's just another vert/horz shooter like Gradius/Lifeforce/Recca.

<br />
<br />Really Ninja Turtles, they must be joking, every single Ninja Gaiden game alone is atleast 10 times harder, so is Contra(unless you use the cheat).
