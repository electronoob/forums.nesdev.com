Heh, this is all too mystical for me! =) Most crystals I have don't have anything written on them but the frequency. I guess it doesn't hurt to have a small stock of different crystals with the same frequency.<br /><br />Too bad not many stores near me have them, so it's not really easy to get varied crystals. Only one or two stores I can physically go to have this kind of stuff. Ordering from abroad isn't really an option because of the insane taxes, but maybe it's time I looked for a good supplier of electronic parts in the country that sells through the internet.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Mon Jun 11, 2012 5:20 am</p><hr />

That doesn't really work here usually, only if you were to design a new system.  <br /><br />Your only real hope is to try and research what crystal was originally used and do your best to match it, not an easy task though.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2012 7:24 pm</p><hr />

I see... and how can I know these characteristics when I'm out buying crystals?<br /><br />I once tried to turn an NES back into NTSC (using pretty much the same technique of removing the transcoding board, undoing all the trace cutting and contact bridging and finally replacing the crystal) and failed miserably. The NES wouldn't turn on at all. Now I'm starting to think it might have had something to do with the crystal... But since the NES crystal is harder to come by, I didn't have a different kind to try.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2012 4:20 pm</p><hr />

There are both series-cut (S in the part number, usually) and parallel-cut(-number in the part number) crystals. Despite being nominally set for the same frequency, if they operated in the wrong mode they be off by many parts per thousand. (Also, what infiniteneslives said)<br /><br />Whether that's enough to be the reason the color component was rejected by your TV's color killer, I don't know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3512">lidnariq</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2012 11:47 am</p><hr />

Crystals dont have polarity.  One thing though is that they are designed for specific load capacitances.  I'd be suprised if that were the actual issue though.  But its conceivable that you had a good crystal at the right frequency, but wrong system capacitance for the first crystal.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2012 1:55 am</p><hr />

I thought about using that potentiometer, but decided not to. This sounds a bit far-fetched, but I really can't think of any explanation. I've moved this console so much, it would be an amazing coincidence if the potentiometer decided to fail exactly during the brief moments that I had that crystal in. Thanks for the guess, though! This is probably just a guessing game after all... =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2012 1:03 am</p><hr />

On the schematics there is a potentiometer connected to the oscillator called 'color delay' that could make colors disappear completely - maybe this has something to do with the problem. Like, it is old and missed contact briefly when you was replacing the crystal.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2012 12:32 am</p><hr />

Today I was modding an Atari 2600 from PAL-M back to NTSC, a process that consists in removing a small transcoder PCB, restoring cut traces, removing added jumpers and replacing the system's crystal.<br /><br />After doing everything but replacing the crystal, I turned the console on to make sure everything was OK. It worked fine, the colors were messed up, as expected because of the wrong crystal, but there were colors. After replacing the crystal, the colors were gone. The image was black and white, although there were visible patterns in areas that were supposed to be flat.<br /><br />Then I found another crystal, with the exact same frequency written on it (3.579545), but in a different kind of packaging (the first one looked like <a href="http://toscos.com/product_images/l/725/crystal_full__07297_zoom.jpg" class="postlink">this</a>, and the second one like <a href="http://www.alalso.com/38-81-large/110592mhz-110592-mhz-crystal-oscillator-hc-49s.jpg" class="postlink">this</a>), and it worked great. All colors were perfect.<br /><br />Of course I'm glad it worked out in the end, but I would reeeeeally like to understand what the hell happened. The first crystal couldn't have been defective, otherwise the console wouldn't work at all. I also don't think the manufacturer would have written the wrong frequency on it. Could this be a polarity issue, and I got it right the second time by accident? Does the polarity matter for crystals in game consoles? Please hardware gurus, help me understand what happened!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=95">tokumaru</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2012 12:18 am</p><hr />
