And I meant it to be more of a multiple-questions thing but by the time I was done ranting about WLA I forgot what else I was going to ask.<br /><br />Anyways.  I tried to set up WLA.bat to output the listing as follows:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">wla-65816 -io %1.asm %1.obj<br />wlalink -vir temp.prj %1.smc</div><br />(I just stuck the 'i's in there.) When trying to execute wlalink it gives &quot;LISTFILE_WRITE_LISTFILES: Out of memory error.&quot;<br /><br />And regarding the traces, I've been using Bizhawk for the last while and it's generally been good, it has a lot of very useful features for debugging.  I've gotten used to reading the trace logs if only because that's how I first started learning SNES code.  It's time-consuming though, I try to solve my problems just watching the emulator's hex editor and thinking about it first if I can.

It is <strong>EXTREMELY SENSITIVE</strong> to where you place arguments and <strong>in what order</strong>.  You really have to read the docs and look at the usage syntax from the docs very very carefully.  Its error messages when you violate this are bizarre and don't make obvious sense.<br /><br />Try:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">wla-65816 -oi %1.asm %1.obj<br />wlalink -ivr temp.prj %1.smc<br /></div><br />This should generate files named %1.lst (where %1 is the base name of the file/thing you've passed that function in DOS batch or on the command line, e.g. <tt style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px; padding:3px; background-color: #3355aa; color: white;">wla.bat main</tt> should result in a main.lst file).<br /><br />If this doesn't work and you continue to get weird errors, you should open up an <a href="https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx/issues" class="postlink">Issues request on github with the WLA DX author</a> to report the problem.  You will probably be asked for the full source code to everything you are doing/working on.  I can confirm listings do work (the stuff I linked/said earlier is proof), so if this happens then there may be another bug.<br /><br />And you should also try the latest WLA DX builds if you can find them.  The most recent ones I was able to find were made by nicklausw here on nesdev.  You can find them in this post: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=139589#p139589">viewtopic.php?p=139589#p139589</a><!-- l --> -- or if you need 32-bit binaries, you can find them in this post (same thread) -- <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=139741#p139741">viewtopic.php?p=139741#p139741</a><!-- l -->

Tried running it with the code you posted in wla.bat, and wlalink crashed somehow...<br /><br />Wish I could tell you where I got the version I've been using from.  Was possibly one of the ones included in bazz's tutorials, can't remember.<br /><br />EDIT:  Okay so I also tried the 32-bit version and that one won't work either, it gives an error with a stack trace.  I tried your commands with the version I was using before and it still says Out of memory error...

You absolutely need cygwin1.dll (included in the .zip) in the same directory as those executables -- failure to do that may result in crashing or a missing DLL error.  These binaries aren't built using the same compiler or framework as the ones mentioned below (above = Cygwin and gcc, below = Visual C++).<br /><br />There are &quot;unsupported&quot; Win32 binaries provided by the WLA DX author any more, as per his website: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.villehelin.com/wla.html">http://www.villehelin.com/wla.html</a><!-- m --> -- the binaries can be found here, the latest being 9.5 built a year and a half ago -- <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.villehelin.com/wla-win32.html">http://www.villehelin.com/wla-win32.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The binaries I linked you from nicklausw are from fairly recent WLA DX code on github.<br /><br />Edit: okay, then go ahead and file an official Issues report with the WLA DX author about the bug.  It sounds like something you're doing in one of your files or some feature you're using does not work correctly with listing generation.  Let us know of the issue (provide a link to it) and let us know what the outcome is when its resolved.

Don't know how comfortable I am with handing over the entire source code.  Will probably try to reduce the project to the simplest case that still gives the error and narrow down what's causing it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The biggest issue, in my experience, is that the development environments in Windows, when making CLI tools, tend to be garbage.  You're either forced into using Visual Studio -- which has a good compiler but is bloated and in a weird way almost requires you to use their IDE and project files and other whatnots (yes I'm aware you can do it all with their makefiles and so on, but man cmd.exe is awful) -- or you're forced to use Cygwin (a travesty for a completely different set of reasons).  Then there's MSYS/MingW, which is (IMO) better than Cygwin by far, but the last time I used that thing its development suite (particularly the include/.h files for Win32 development) was completely busted.  Every single thing I've seen about the WLA DX code indicates that the author seems to have a hard-on for *IX systems, which is fine (remember I'm a UNIX SA), but most people doing dev are going to be on Windows.<br /><br />That said: multi-platform and multi-arch support is a complete nightmare no matter what suite you go with.  Just looking through the makefiles/ directory makes me want to gag.  (I have no idea why the guy designed it that way, by the way, nor am I left with the impression that the guy knows how to write actual GNU makefiles -- but then again a lot of people write crappy ones because the gmake documentation is a tome and not so greatly organised unless you know exactly what you're looking for).<br /><br />All that rambling aside, I haven't taken the time to really look at the actual WLA DX code in detail, but a quick skim of some of the most key files indicate the author uses comments super, *SUPER* sparingly.  That doesn't bode well for any open-source project, especially one as complex as a compiler.  The probability of others getting involved greatly diminishes then.  Comparatively, I tend to be pretty lenient with comments in both closed- and <a href="https://github.com/koitsu/bsdhwmon" class="postlink">open-source projects</a>, all because I operate off the assumption that 6 months from now I'll have to re-visit some code and will certainly say &quot;why the heck did I do it this way?  *reads comments* Oh right! Right right right&quot;.  But that's just my style, I guess.  I'm also very clear about what I'm changing in commit messages.  (Both are in contrast to my workplace, where when I try to inject comments explaining why something is the way it is, I am often told &quot;remove that&quot;.  Most of the code I've worked on at work is devoid of comments.  It's disheartening)<br /><br />Finally, moving to CMake isn't going to solve code issues or bugs.  In fact, CMake is nightmare fuel on a completely different level -- if you think gmake is bad, you're entering a world of pain and hurt with CMake.  It is absolutely possible to write coherent and decent Makefiles that work with both GNU make and BSD make, while with CMake I hope you enjoy variable names that take up the <a href="http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables" class="postlink">entire width of your terminal window</a> and are both documented and undocumented at the same time (this is hard to describe/explain in text).  I can get around inside of a classic Makefile within a few minutes; with CMake this could take me days.
