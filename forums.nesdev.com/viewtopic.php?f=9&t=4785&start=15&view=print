<br />
<br />You cut off the excess plastic and flip it around.  The problem after this is that you have no screw holes any more to tie it down, but it's not really a big deal because you will notice there are two screw posts just behind the connector where the bottom metal shield comes out a bit.  This is the perfect spot to put two screws sticking out halfway to prevent the connector from sliding off toward the back when you insert a cart.  I leave my top RF shield off, BTW, though I don't think this even matters...I think you can put it back on after the mod if you really wanted to.  Anyway, since when the connector is right-side up you must push the cart down to make contact, the top pins are springy.  You will notice this springyness makes it stubborn to stay on when the connector is upside down.  My solution to this was to simply put two pennies (one each to the left and right) halfway underneath the back of connector to prop it up a bit (you wedge the halfway underneath the back and resting on the little piece of shield that sticks out next to the screws/screwholes...it's a lot more obvious when you see it.  I'll get a pic if anybody reeeeally wants me to).  It's worked perfectly for a long time this way.  Carts rarely need to be inserted more than twice.  And yes, I did the pin 4 mod, so I'm sure that helps too, but whatever.

<br />
<br />The main advantage you have is that the NES motherboard is really thick compared to NES game boards, so the loose part of the connector doesn't have much trouble making contact with the motherboard. And like rbudrick said, it's really reliable and you can basically insert a game once and it'll work.

My lab here is like an NES dead-zone, 3 CopyNES units spanning both generations (building one for a friend), 1 new and maybe 4 old connectors, and none of them work worth a crap.  The new connector worked great at first.  Only my toploader works, and it's seen a lot of abuse.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So far, I've actually had pretty good luck with the replacement cartridge connectors I got on eBay - it just tends to get dirty easily. I came up with a simpler cleaning method though...
<br />
<br />The official NES cleaning kit is this "cart" with a handle, and a funny cardboard thing inside, instead of a circuit board. It sorta works, but not as well as I'd like, and once the cardboard gets dirty, then you're kinda stuck.
<br />
<br />So, I took a junk cartridge board, and stuck a standard white paper mailing label over the fingers. It's just almost long enough to cover them all, and it's wide enough to fold it around the edge of the board and back over to cover the fingers on both sides.
<br />
<br />With this clean white paper stuck over the contacts, I put the board back into a cart case, and stuck it into the NES and pulled it out. I only did it once, but it did get off some dirt from a couple pins. I did not try clicking the cart down.
<br />
<br />The NES has worked perfectly ever since.
<br />
<br />Peel the label off the fingers of your junk board and throw it away - use a new label the next time, and try not to leave it on there too long, or it'll be a pain to get off. And don't put more than one label on, one thickness is about perfect to clean the contacts. I didn't add any solvent, the slight roughness of the paper is all you need.
<br />
<br />The key with these replacement connectors is CLEAN YOUR GAMES, AND CLEAN THEM GOOD! One dirty game can leave enough crud on the connector in the console to cause failures. In my case, I had a game I cleaned only quickly, and that gunked it up.
<br />
<br />You really need game bits. Take all newly acquired games apart and scrub the edge connector clean with alcohol on a Q-tip. It's amazing how gunky these games get, and it's amazing how much scrubbing it can take to get it clean. No matter how hard you scrub, if you are using a q-tip and alcohol, you won't hurt the contacts. But don't EVER use any kind of abrasives to clean the cartridge contacts! NEVER! I have heard of people trying to use abrasive cleaners to clean them and this IS A BAD THING.
<br />
<br />I tried it on another junk board - a glop top Mario/Duck Hunt that I had raided for the casing. I used Brasso (a brass polish), and put a tiny bit on a q-tip and scrubbed the contacts. The q-tip came out VERY black. It took several clean q-tips to finish cleaning up the Brasso, and each one came out black. But the contacts looked... odd. They were very, very shiny, but they weren't gold anymore. I had only done about half on one side, so I could compare. The tiny drop Brasso has completely removed the gold plating from the contacts! The black gunk I was seeing on the q-tip was the plating getting scrubbed off. The nickel plating underneath is what I was seeing shiny! Around the edges of a couple, the bare copper was starting to show through. So, yeah, squeaky clean yes - good, no. These contacts were completely DESTROYED by just a tiny amount of Brasso. I'm sure this cart would work for at least a bit, but as soon as the naked contacts start to oxidize, it's going to stop working - and it's going to leave oxide deposits on the contacts in the Nintendo. And then that's going to stop working.
<br />
<br />Bottom line. DON'T clean carts with anything abrasive!
<br />
<br />-Ian

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My favorite method for cleaning the edge connector is to find a bowl with a flat bottom...maybe one that margarine comes in or something (cleaned out thoroughly, of course).  Then, fill the bowl with a bout 3/8 of an inch of rubbing alcohol.  Using a soft-bristled toothbrush, place the dirty edge connector in the bowl and scrub away all the grime.  Let it dry thoroughly and you should be golden.

Then use a Q-Tip and you'll notice that it will clean out quite fast these connectors. BTW you can use that solution for pennies as well

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I remember doing something in Chemistry where I had to line a bowl with tin foil, and pour boiling baking soda water in it. If you drop a silver coin in it, a chemical reaction similar to what happens in a battery occurs, and all of the crud on the coin will be removed, adhering to the tin foil. But I don't know if you'd want to put your NES games in boiling baking soda water  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> . And I don't know how much this would work with NES contacts (it's probably to clean silver only).

<br />Yikes! That's probably why my R.C. Pro Am cart isn't working anymore then. I've cleaned it to the point of being shiny and non gold colored as you've said. Ok, I ruined an R.C. Pro Am cart...oh well. haha
<br />
<br />I've been able to use the brasso / rubbing alcohol technique on the rest of my games with no problems, and it didn't rub off the gold color.  The reason is I realized that brasso ALWAYS TURNS BLACK no matter what you rub it on! I used to think, as most people do, that it means more and more and more dirt was coming off, but no, its just the brasso itself turning black.
<br />
<br />However, after reading this post I think I will cease using brasso and use only the milder rubbing alcohol solution. This makes me wonder what the white paste is that nintendorepairshop sells....maybe diluted brasso?
