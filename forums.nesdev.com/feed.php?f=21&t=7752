They did well when porting Contra to some systems, but go check out the C64 version (or heaven forbid, the DOS version). Other games were the same way, check the various non-NES Castlevania ports, most of them suck.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=325">LocalH</a> — Mon Jun 13, 2011 8:34 am</p><hr />

I think Konami did very well when porting Contra, Super Contra and Gradius II. You can see how much effort they put into Contra and Super Contra, they are very different from the arcade.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4883">mkwong98</a> — Fri Jun 10, 2011 3:32 am</p><hr />

This is the main reason I've given up doing both C64 and NES versions of the same game.<br />It would be SOOO hard to downscale everything to fit C64's inferior graphics that it would be a major headache for every single thing from sprites to background.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38">Bregalad</a> — Sun May 15, 2011 2:55 am</p><hr />

It often wasn't scaled down, actually, but remade from scratch, both graphics and gameplay, to make just something that would resemble the original.<br /><br />I recall that I've read in some old computer mags that devs of ports of arcade hits to home computers often had nothing but the access to the arcade unit to work with, and sometimes it was just video recording of the gameplay. No source code, design docs, etc. Sometimes video recording was used to get the original graphics as base to draw on.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Sat May 14, 2011 5:27 pm</p><hr />

Fighting game sprites themselves were often resized down from hand-drawn animation cels, using high-quality scaling algorithms, and then had outline effects (aka "<a href="http://pixel-zone.rpgdx.net/shtml/tut-selout1.shtml" class="postlink">selout</a>") applied.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9">tepples</a> — Sat May 14, 2011 5:26 pm</p><hr />
