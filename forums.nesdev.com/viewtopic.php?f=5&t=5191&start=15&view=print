When it's for a few weeks that's okay if you have terrible overtime to do, but if that's always it should just be depressing. If the government is placing rules, the good trick should be to work for the government... so that you are sure they aren't breaking their own rules. In my country it's well know that anyone working for the government has very good working conditions.
<br />
<br />And yeah it's always motivating to have a pretty girl nearby.

<br />Sorry about the language but... Really holy <span style="color: indigo"><span style="font-size: 75%; line-height: normal">Fuckin' shit</span></span>!!!
<br />I've been like this and thought I was the only one.
<br />I do this, then I start coding some game in visual studios or gamemaker. then I get too tired, and pass out. WHen I awake I think my work was dumb then trash it.
<br />
<br />
<br />Edit: Also, staying up late is my only chance on to get on these forums now. That's why I keep rambling on like I do. I am actually a pretty sharp person with good grammer. But when I'm tired like this I have trouble composing good english. //btw, it's late right now.

Because I have more responsibilities in life now, I'm forced to be focused and efficient when I do have time to program (for fun...I'm a programmer at my day job too)...and ironically I think I get more done now than when I was a teenager!

<br />That's what you call experience <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  As a teenager you have no fear and ready to attack impossible goal (and usually never reach it). Now you think twice before doing something and evaluate more on how to approach it.

<br />Yes, but creative ideas goes dratiscally down as age goes high (at least for me)  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />

<br />That is if you know how to write it.
<br />I'm cursed with good music ideas, but haven't a clue on how to write them down. I guess I can learn but I've got too much to study already.

<br />There are plenty of notations, and you might find some of them easier to learn than the Western common practice notation. Several Asian countries such as India and China have "cipher notations" that use symbols for pitches, much like MML and LilyPond.
<br />
<br />Or you can sing into a voice recorder.

<br />I think part of it is realizing what ideas are
<br />
<br />a) not reasonable to implement ("a 500 hour RPG in FF6 style with 100 unique endings!")
<br />b) not as entertaining to the world as it is to you ("a game focused on all your base and lolcats!")
<br />c) not as fun as it might sound on paper ("a game that perfectly models reality!")
<br />
<br />When you're a child, you're brimming with all sorts of crazy ideas that you later realize were...well, stupid.  I don't know if it's <em>creativity diminishing</em> as much as greater swaths of unworkable ideas being eliminated quickly due to a more mature, educated mind.

<br />Well, if everyone who have an idea for a game would have called themselves supid, then nobody would ever have written any game. Almost all artists (I coniser making games is some kind of art) started as teenagers. It sure would be hard for 12 year olds boys to create a FF6-syte RPG with 100 hours, because it would take forever to programm it, it would be even harder to imagine a 40 year old guy, who has to go to work daily and possibly take care of his family, to suddently come out and make an awesome cool 100 hour RPG without having programming any game before, even if he knowns programming a lot professionally for non-game stuff. The 12 year old kids would typically come out with characters, enemies and story in a matter of minutes, which gives them the adventage over the adult man who has lost his immagination.
<br />
<br />BTW RPGs aren't necessary harder to programm than other genre I think (altough I haven't realeased any games yet). In fact you need less precision for timing, enemy AI, etc... it might actually be a genre quite easy to programm for, but the hardest to design for. (hardest but most interesting too).

I designed my own Mario game where question blocks would show the top part of their contents sticking out.  What a lame idea!  First of all I should've been more creative than to use someone else's existing game, and secondly that design decision ruins the fun, the mystery, of the question blocks.<br /><br />When you're a kid, you have dozens of game ideas, all of them pretty terrible.  As a teen or adult, it's true that you may only have two or three good game ideas, but you were able to recognize the difference between good and bad ideas.  You lose quantity and gain quality.<br /><br />But if you are actually arguing that you lose both quantity and quality, I cannot agree.  As a child my game ideas were all "Mario only better" or "Zelda only better."  Small modifications of existing concepts that weren't even very good game design.  Now I have the ability to create on my own, to flesh out new ideas.  My creativity has grown.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The 12 year old kids would typically come out with characters, enemies and story in a matter of minutes, which gives them the adventage over the adult man who has lost his immagination.</div><br />An example of a 12 year old's character would be "NPC man #24," the guy who says "Hello warriors, I think you are great!"

<br />I understand that, I just meant the thought as a kid where you say, "a game just like this one only 1000x longer and branching paths all over that make a huge difference on the story and etc. etc."
