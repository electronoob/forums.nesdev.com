<br />The Tetris Company has a reputation of aggressive behaviour against people implementing the Tetris idea.

<br />Same for First Star Software and Boulderdash: they have a harsh zero-tolerance attitude against homebrew variants of Boulderdash. That's the reason why the Atari 2600 port was cancelled.

<br />Yet nobody touched Crystal Mines, Exodus, or Joshua.
<br />
<br />So what's the best way to proceed if someone cease-and-desists the core of your project's gameplay?

<br />
<br />Well, either design a different game, or prepare for a legal battle. I guess most people would prefer choice #1.
<br />
<br />Which again brings us to: how big is the probability that some company will check a homebrew game made for an obsolete game system for IP infringement. I guess no one can answer that. In the case of First Star Software, they are pretty much aware of the homebrew retro scene.
<br />
<br />EDIT: perhaps that might be interesting to you: <a href="http://abednarz.net/wp/34/" class="postlink">http://abednarz.net/wp/34/</a>
<br />
<br />Perhaps you should change the name "Tetramino" into something else, not resembling the name "Tetris".

<br />
<br />Quite true. But I said that chances are high that the cease and desist will be the worst that will happen, not that it IS the worst that can happen. If it's desired I'll edit my post to make what I was saying more clear. I don't want to mislead people into doing something stupid, but neither do I want to scare them from doing something where there may not be a consequence at all.
<br />
<br />edit: Though on second thought blargg makes a fair point. I am changing my post.

<br />
<br />haha, just stop bro! Your game is fine, and doesn't have to be buried, and you know it : P
<br />
<br />But, on the topic of IPs and all that jazz, I don't see why it should be an issue, honestly. If you're not wanting to make your own IPs and have your own stories, then what's the point of developing your own game? That doesn't really make much sense to me, but hey, different strokes for different folks!
<br />
<br />To me, the thrill of programming isn't _just_ learning how to do more on the system we program for, but also planning things from your imagination. So honestly, I don't see the draw to doing programs with characters that one didn't create :/ It almost reminds me of being a cover band or something...

<br />Then we need to make it easier for 2D pixel artists and 6502 programmers to find each other.
