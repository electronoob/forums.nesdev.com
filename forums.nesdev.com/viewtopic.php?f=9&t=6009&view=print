<br />
<br />I know that all the files stored on a computer's HD are managed by native file system. But is there a possibility for an intermediate program which translates the request/data between the nes and the computer on request?

<br />
<br />Even though computers are really fast and could theoretically decode the address and return a byte (maybe even emulating mappers), modern software is many layers of abstraction away from the hardware in order to stay synchronized with the NES.
<br />
<br />So I guess the answer, unfortunately, is no. I'd love if someone could prove me wrong though.

<br />
<br />I mean, if the computer was fast enough to feed every memory fetch manually, you probably could do the mapper logic "for free", so, given the fictional computer that could do this, you wouldn't also need a mapper.
<br />
<br />At that point, you're going to have a RAM cart into which you download data. I thought one already existed, though.

<br />You're probably thinking of PowerPak Lite, but it needs a mod soldered onto the NES.
<br />
<br />As for Anders_A's request: USB interfaces on carts for Nintendo systems have been done before; see EFA-Linker.

<br />
<br />Useless? It's far from useless. Most people have no way of getting their programs to even run on the NES since they don't have a cartridge with EPROM sockets and an EPROM programmer. But I agree it would be nice if you could somehow hookup a device to the PC that would allow instant changes. 
<br />
<br />The closest thing to what you describe would be the FDS Loader though. But FDS has a much lower transfer rate than MaskROMs for NES which I think need to be 250ns.

<br />I think the most usable solution for this would be to transfer the data using controller port/ports with special "mapper" running on PowerPak. The transfer speed isn't that great but for deving it wouldn't really matter that much since the PC side could watch for changes and only transfer those parts.

<br />Although the PowerPak Like is more like what you wanted when you started this thread, the regular PowerPak is better for common users. The PowerPak Lite can only be used with a CopyNES, which requires some hardcore modifications to your console in order to be installed (most people that are not into electronics can't do it by themselves).
<br />
<br />To test your programs on the PowerPak you do have to copy the files to the CF card (hat you'll be constantly moving from the PowerPak to your PC and back), so you really can't use it to test every build of your programs, but it certainly is a good tool for testing your software from time to time, while emulators are used for everyday development. You can also use the PowerPak to verify how the NES reacts to conditions that are not yet well emulated and to make sure that programs using special tricks will work on hardware.
<br />
<br />For prices and stuff check the manufacturer's site: <a href="http://www.retrousb.com/index.php?cPath=24" class="postlink">http://www.retrousb.com/index.php?cPath=24</a>
<br />
<br />Not that you will need a CopyNES (which you'll need to install yourself) in order to use the PowerPak Lite, so it's not that much cheaper in the end. Also remember that these products don't work on clones, so you need an actual Nintendo console.

<br />
<br />That's another problen then!!!
<br />The console I am using I think is a Famicom clone. Where would I get an original console? OR can the clone console be "fixed" so that powerpak lite works on it?

<br />PowerPak Lite requires CopyNES, and CopyNES does not work on clones. So no.

In most countries where the NES was sold it's easy to find them in auction sites. If it was popular in your country, sometimes you'll even get lucky just by asking about the NES around people you know that were kids back in the early 90's, and someone will just give you one. If the NES wasn't a popular console in your country you can always find a US seller who is willing to ship worldwide. All you need to use eBay and PayPal is a credit card.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">OR can the clone console be "fixed" so that powerpak lite works on it?</div>
<br />No, they can't be fixed. Clones are just "close enough" replicas of the real deal, which means they are different in some areas, and these details are enough to prevent some carts with specialized hardware that depends on them to not work, including the PowerPak and games using the MMC5 mapper. And like it's been said, the CopyNES does not work on clones.
<br />
<br />Anyway, if you are serious about programming for the NES you NEED the real console. Clones generate the wrong colors, the wrong sound, and some are even known to have timing issues, so they do not make good testing platforms for NES software.

<br />I have a few PAL-NES which looks like crap (missing game door and semi-broken top case), but they work and is compatible with copynes...
<br />
<br />so if you are interested i could send you one if you want to pay for the shipping from sweden, don't know how much it would cost though (location: earth doesn't really help)
