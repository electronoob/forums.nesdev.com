Bleh like pretty much all remakes anyway.<br />What makes it hard is that if you're dumb and assign jobs poorly, for example learning white mage and black mage on the same person (like I did on my first play through) then you'll be stuck at the end of the game.<br /><br />Blue Mage rocks, and Butz really looks cool as a blue mage. However, it takes a while from the start of the game until you can learn the majorly useful skills (Aqua Breath, Aero, White Wind, etc...)<br /><br />I've heard from Celius that FF4 (J) is the hardest of all and that even at Lv 99 the last boss is terrificly hard but I don't know whether it's true.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Yea DQ8 is easy, and you're not missing much anyway(It's a Sqyare DQ game, so I doubt we'll ever see anoth actually good GQ game ever again, nevermind a great one sigh).</div><br />I DISAGREE ! DQ8 is a masterpiece, and have been developed by Level 5 (not Square Enix). Like all other DQs, it requires you to do some annoying girding but overall it's still an awesome game and the best of the series IMO. However I'm doubtful about DQ9, it will come out on the DS next month, and 3D games on the DS usually looks like complete crap. It's still developed by level 5 I think so it might actually be as good as DQ8 but with less good graphics - let's wait and see.</div>
<br />
<br />LV 5 was comissioned by Square, It's still a Square game, but they're just too lazy to make it them self. I hate lv 5 with a passion as well, they are 100% graphics over gameplay(lv 5, and square are like soul mates).
<br />
<br />DQ8 was slightly better then a complete POS, and It's nowhere near a masterpiece.  Clearly you never player DQ7, DQ6 or DQ3(NES version, not the POS remake).
<br />
<br />Graphics over gameplay is "always" a bad thing, stop acting like It's a good thing.

<br />
<br />Anyways - no I've never played DQ7 because it wasn't released here - DQ8 was the first DQ game ever released in my country (well - after DQM on the GB). I played a little of DQ6 emulated and it looked quite good. I've made a full playtrough of DW3 on my GBC and I also played the NES version but didn't go very far - I'm sorry but the counter-intuitive menus and ridiculous girding needed from the start really pisses me off.
<br />
<br />To me it sounds like you never really played DQ8 - you just say you have it without even trying. It has some of the best graphics out there and the gameplay is just like all others DQs - attack - heal - attack attack - heal - attack attack - heal - you won 3 EXP !!!! etc... But at least you gain some useful skills and the menus are nicely made. The orchestral music is amazing too - and the wolrd map is spectacular. It might not be 100% perfect, but I consider it by far the best DQ - altough I admit I have only made a full playtrough of 3, 5 and 8 so it's true it's hard to say it without having fully played the whole series.
<br />
<br />However I agree the fusion of Square and Enix has been terrible, the only good game they made IMO is DQ8, and maybe Valkirie Profile 2 and FFTA2 which are half-good. All other SE games are pretty much lame, especially FF12.

<br />Well then stick to the newer Square games, you can coast through them(I don't even know why there are even levels/xp in such games), as you clearly don't like RPGs, you like interactive movies(RPGs are suppose to involve a journey(which implies "hardships"), if everything just comes to you without needing to put tons of effort into it, what's the point, watch a movie instead).
<br />
<br />PS. The DQ3 remake sucks, everything that made the original great, was removed(the treasure hunting aspect was basically completely removed sigh, so much for replay value, and such). The original was pretty easy as is, but the GBC version is brokenly easy(they give you tons of seeds at the start, and then there's the Thief class, they might as well start you at lv 99).
<br />
<br />What country are you in, AU(because all the major gaming regions got DQ7, and such)?
<br />
<br />I beat it twice, hoping DQ8 would get better, it sucks, the graphics is just new school smut, and the art style sucks(I rather the DQ series go back to DW 1, then the dirrection It's going in). The gameplay sucks, and no It's not the same as the past DQ games, It's a water down half fast attempt at making it seem simular to the real DQ games. The DQ8 mechanics/systems have little to no substance(the recruitable monster system in DQ8, compared to the past games is just one example of such watered down systems).

<br />What you say is non-sense -  there is not a signgle FMV in DQ8 and there is very few cutscenes overall for today's standards. If you can't stand any cut scenes or good graphics then then fine - it's a NES forum after all so I can understand that - just admit all people aren't like that. I fully agree cutscenes or good graphics doesn't make a good game by themselves, but they can possibly enhance gameplay experience.
<br />I love RPGs - but like you say I like to go on a journey I don't like to spend too many time level griding - especially if the battle system is really simple. That's why I'm not a fan of the NES DW games.
<br />
<br />And I'd like to have a in-dept proof of ANYTHING which is worse in the GBC than the NES. I don't know - I haven't played much the NES version as I said. If you loved the NES version as a child I can understand the nostalgia factor is gone with remakes - as I don't like remakes as a whole. However I still liked the GBC DW3.

<br />No, I didn't say DQ 8 had movies, I was just pointing out, that's more your speed(seeing how you are all hung over the good graphics aspect of games, and hate any kind of grind. Also in DQ8s case, It's far worse then CGs in other games, 3D the RPG killer, the pure RPG genre doesn't support the 3D format. Over sized crappy maps, with little to fill it, and when I say crappy maps, oh god are they bad).
<br />
<br />It's an all around bad game when compared to almost anything made before the PS2 era, and It's very disgraceful for anyone to call that a masterpiece. Wow newschool gamers really don't have standards, do they(take a POS, put some shiny paint on it, and you'll think It's a good game)?
<br />
<br />I'm done fighting with you, you want to like ****fine, I'll go play the "Greats".

<br />
<br />What is, to say the least, interesting, is that you clash DQ8 for being too much new-scool when it was actually supposed to be old-scool, and that many people bashed the game for being old-scool. It is kinda fun haha.
<br />
<br />Remember a friend of mine which shares with me the passion of RPGs but he's always sayning "this sucks, I hate this, this game suck, etc..." so after all I wonder why he likes RPGs.... but oh well this is life. I'm like this sometimes too - especially when FF12 is concerned  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />You mean you hated FF 12(I still can't understand how anyone can like that game, the only thing worse is FF 13)I'm surprised?
<br />
<br />Lol, if DQ 8 was suppose to be old school, wow boy did they miss the mark. While simular to old school systems(aka wannabe systems), they are new school systems, that try to emulate old school type systems(very poorly may I add).
