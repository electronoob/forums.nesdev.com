<br />
<br />Today I found by luck a few MMC5 carts for very cheap and I thought that could be great dev cart (for the curious, Just breed).  But before I decide to mutilate those carts, I would like to know what are the goods and the bads about that mapper?  Is it only good things?
<br />
<br />I remember Tokumaru and Bregalad talking about it somewhere but couldn't  find the appropriate thread but I just want more information about what to expect about it.

<br />- Extended graphics features
<br />- 2 more sound channels
<br />- Very fine tuned PRG and CHR bankswitching, all imaginable shemes allowed
<br />- Customizable nametable mirroring, all imaginable shemes using up to 3 different tables are allowed
<br />- Very good scanline IRQ that can perform about anything in the world
<br />- Hardware multiplier so that it fast things up
<br />- Have mapper RAM that can be used for either graphics or programm so that you don't need an extra RAM chip if your game engines require up to 3kB
<br />- Can hanle a lot of extra SRAM, theorically up to 64kB.
<br />- Very safe battery backup
<br />
<br />Bad :
<br />- Carts are rare to find, and Just Breed is a very good game. You should destoy a Koei game instead if you can because they suck.

<br />
<br />In my case, since I'm in japan,  I found today those 2 Just breed in a junk pile for 1$ each.  When I saw that, I jumped on them.  In general they are sold between 6$/10$.  They can still be found at least.  For now one seems to work properly, the other one didn't have any save game on it so I don't know yet if it's ok or not.
<br />
<br />Of course I want to keep at least one.  Those not so great koei game, I guess there must be in that junk pile for 0.50/1$. I just need to make a list before I got "hunting" for those cart.  Now I just checked the mapper list and I found out that l'empereur is one of those MMC5 game, didn't know.

<br />But can the MMC5 map RAM into the pattern tables in case my game needs to display graphics that don't fit well into tiles? Think Videomation, Qix, Elite.

Heck, I'm still looking for ANY MMC5 game so that I can make a devcart out of it (no Bregalad, I don't care for any of them). Sadly, I've never seen a MMC5 cart at all, let alone for sale. Maybe I should try online, and pay some outrageous price plus shipping... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />
<br />
<br />Feature-wise, it's got a bunch of stuff that you can choose to use or not, and in some cases the games could even be easily converted to other simpler, more common mappers. What I'm trying to say is: It won't hurt to have a MMC5 devcart. I want one, even if only for experimenting with it's features.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tokumaru, I'm sorry but Castlevania III and Just Breed are probably the 2 best NES games I've ever played (with Final Fantasy III) and both are MMC5. I really don't understand how you could not care about those game.
<br />
<br />But it's true if you find a loose cart for $1 it shouldn't be too lame to destroy it. But I paid my Just Breed $60 and this was supposed to be cheap <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> (I already see some Final Fantasy 3 cartridges for arround $180 here one has to be crazy to buy that). Anyway pretty much all video games here are 3 times the price they are somewhere else in the world, especially import games (because porting is expensive).
<br />
<br />And I don't even have my brother in law's 60to72 converter any longer so I can't even play it, the cart is pretty worthless as it.
<br />
<br />And Tepples pointed out the only weakness of the MMC5, it doesn't allow for CHRRAM at all. But in most cases the indefinite BG tile feature and full 8kb sprite pattern table features really make CHRRAM not needed.
<br />Looks like Nintendo was really going for CHRROM towards end MMC3 and MMC5 area, few games used CHRRAM.

<br />Sorry, no special feelings for them... =) And destroying carts is not the worse thing in the world. If you are successful at making the devcart, you can always burn the original game and play it there.

There are probably features that allow you to bankswitch less than the whole pattern table though, and these would help. Oh, and also, I want my polygonal movies. I know you could use 4x4 pixels, but that's not what I want to do. And also, it would take A LOT of CHR ROM space to define all the shapes you'd want to use.
<br />
<br />Oh, and Bregalad, I payed $9 for Final Fantasy III. Since it was just a loose cart, I bought another boxed copy of the game to keep for $30, and I will be using this one as a DevCart.
<br />
<br />Tokumaru, there are plenty of copies of Castlevania III for sale on Ebay. Though if for some reason Ebay isn't an option, yeah, I don't know what you'd do to find a copy.
<br />
<br />I just looked, and there's a copy for $10 that ships to Brazil for $8. I suppose this is a little expensive for shipping though.

<br />Thanks for the tip. Yeah, it's not very expensive, but the shipping does get in the way a bit. Maybe I can find a person with other interesting carts and get a few at once.

<br />
<br />I think MMC5 is awesome, but it'd far less common than the very capable MMC3. I really think for most projects the best choices are MMC3 or discrete logic boards like UNROM.

The only possible "issue" is some junk cart connectors are not always like new. They can have more wear than non junk carts. If you don't mind that part then the're plenty of loose cart here.  I could always send to other interested people too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But I paid my Just Breed $60 and this was supposed to be cheap Sad (I already see some Final Fantasy 3 cartridges for arround $180 here one has to be crazy to buy that). </div><br /><br />At 180$, wow,  that's expensive. It's not that price at all. One day when I was in Akihabara, I heard some European complaining about how expensive the same game was in their country.  Online dealer are the worst, they sell those imports at very far from their original price and often they're not in mint condition!  <br /><br />Final Fantasy 3 recently became cheaper in Japan (if you search properly). I guess that must have happened after the DS version came out. If you pay more than 30$ for it, that's too much, even 30$ is still expensive here.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bregalad wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And Tepples pointed out the only weakness of the MMC5, it doesn't allow for CHRRAM at all.</div>
<br />
<br />Hmm.. I was planning to use that. But if you have access to more chr-rom then maybe it's not an issue after all. I will need to study what I can do with the MMC5 and plan my game according to it.
<br />
<br />Edit: We should make a list of interesting cart for dev use.  I'm sure people would find that information useful.

<br />Pros: More emulators support MMC5 than a homemade mapper. This is important because most people will be playing your game's demo version in an emulator on a PC running Windows.
