Before the forums, that's all this website ever was.. just a collection of info ripped from other sites (which tend to disappear over time, but this place hasn't <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />), and maybe a couple things from the (really old) NESdev mail list.<br /><br />It doesn't come up often, but it seems fine with me to credit someone for contributing obscure info.  Only thing that comes to mind is fascinating Ntd_8bit.jpg Famicom schematic.  A Brazilian dude sent it to me (IIRC, he was building a Famiclone computer).  I gave the credit since it was asked for, totally appropriate.  So now he's <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ubaldo+prones" class="postlink">famous</a> for it, heheh.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10">Memblers</a> — Mon Sep 13, 2010 3:18 pm</p><hr />

I've been thinking more about this and realized that you, Xious, put some time into finding the images and making them available, and figured you would share that with us. You renamed them so they would have a consistent scheme (as I often do with things I download). In the midst of combing the web for them, you hadn't made notes of the source (again, I rarely note the URLs of things I download). And then your act of sharing was pissed on with a rude reply.<br /><br />I regret having posted anything to this thread in the first place.

Xious, quit playing the victim or someone might accuse you of being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackery" class="postlink">quack-troll</a> hiding behind novella-sized posts of jargon.<br /><br />Everything I said was warranted and since it appears I must, I'll spend the next hour writing out the points:<br /><br />-Your "colorful" writing <em>style</em> is not pretentious, this is: "you've probably never seen anywhere else" as is your disclaimer, as is the use of the word "comprehensive" and telling your audience to "enjoy" [your work]. <br /><br />-You act strangely biased against the official schematic (even though at least 6 of Enri's schematics are made redundant by it), yet have it in your archive. Particularly before your edit you had stressed its commonality--which doesn't matter from an educational standpoint. You also nitpick(ed) the schematic's low quality and incompleteness, which I found ludicrous, so I made a statement about it.<br /><br />-You are not alone in having access to exotic Japanese sites or the ability to use a web translator so it would be wise to not presume. I for one found the site through SMS Power, an English-language site which links it on the homepage.<br /><br />-What you have (/had) to gain was reputation from your "work" in either community. You seek credit in this very thread: "please only credit me for them as a contributor", coincidentally being modest after I posted my reply to the other message board.<br /><br />-Regarding the oscillator thread: I too have the disability of being a "westerner" and I have no problem making out the kana. But I have a history with the language. Some of the kanji is illegible to someone without the ability infer the radicals (such as myself) but the text is irrelevant here; your explanation made no sense. I strongly suggest learning some electrical theory and terminology instead of sharing your own reasoning and language. Lack of knowledge isn't an excuse for a disability, but fabricating stuff like that which wastes everybody's time, including your own, is sure a sign of one.<br /><br />Bottom line: to avoid "confusion" in future discussions you should cite sources for work collected by you or stop promoting and publishing unfinished projects when they still have dubious integrity. It would be very wise to *demonstrate* your motives, using the sources you collect from as an example, for any other knuckleheaded readers.<br /><br />I had my fun, I'm done.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20">kyuusaku</a> — Sun Sep 12, 2010 5:56 pm</p><hr />

Total time spent: 2 minutes. Result: folder of 21 schematic PNGs, as compared to the 23 in your linked folder.<br /><br />Going back to what kyuusaku said:<br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Wow, so you mean you went through all the trouble of finding Enri's homepage and downloading his schematics?! Mad props!<br /></div><br />Is there any factual error in this statement? I don't understand why you're up in arms about his comment.</div><br /><br />It was my time locating a site with them, not downloading them that mattered. This isn't all of what I have, but some of it *is* copyrighted and I didn't upload it. I also deleted a few files because I was unsure if I wanted to share them.<br /><br />Seeking as you asked, I'm irked mainly at the snide and cynical way that kyuusaky implied that I tried to take credit for their creation, which I never did, and hen went on to poke fun at my attempt to translate blurry kanji (before I examined the circuit, admittedly). I didn't even notice that it was a vericap because the image the poster put on FW was tiny and pretty much only showed the text and that he wanted somebody to translate, and I miffed on the syntax.<br /><br />A vericap can regulate an oscillator, but it also has other uses and all I did was try to do a raw translation of hard to read kanji, and for that I became the target of his ridicule. In fact, a vericap can both be used inline with another cap to provide power to an oscillator, if memory serves, and the oscillator can modulate the current to the vericap as well, so my translation could have partially been accurate, although it wasn't, as further observation would have illuminated if I taken the time to look first at the entire schematic.<br /><br />Reading kanji is a huge pain for a westerner, and the fact that the kana looked like they were photographed from vaseline and I was looking at a thumbnail sized version of them certainly didn't help. I had to use a <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/2230_Basic_Kanji.svg/2000px-2230_Basic_Kanji.svg.png" class="postlink">chart of all of the commonly used symbols</a> to get what I could out of it as it is... If you reverse what I said in my translation and clean up the syntax, it makes a lot more sense.<br /><br />All he needed to say was 'These are PNGs created by X from site Y', not things like 'being sexually used by everybody's grandmother'. 'Mad props.'I did implies that I'm trying to show off by pretending that chewing bubble gum is as hard as doing backflips. It's unwelcome sarcasm, given the situation. So, sue me: I didn't remember the source because it was obscure and a bit hard to find the first time. My response may have been over-the-top, but can you blame me? How would you feel if you had a hidden treasure and decided to share it with other people with no possibility of gain, and somebody (whom I frankly didn't recognize at the time) immediately ripped on you for doing it?<br /><br />Apparently, having a colourful and professional writing style is pretentious too. I'm sorry if I don't sound like a teenager. I write technical manuals and tech articles, so this is my style, but I don't go out of my way to insult people unless they initiate such childlike behaviour. Additionally, I have no trouble speaking my mind.<br /><br />Nomatter. I'll just keep this kind of stuff to myself from now on and only post original stuff, when I fell like giving it away. I was going to U/L my PCB mask and schematic (for free use) for two types of A/V mod kits  that I plan to make, but the heck with that. I'll just make and sell them instead.<br /><br />I primarily use the schematics for $4016 and $4017 data path information, so I didn't remember off the top of my head what was going on between C5 and TC1, so excuse me for just translating the annotations, which is what the OP requested. That's one of the reasons I want to redraw the schematic, colour code it, and annotate it.For one thing, I'm old, my eyesight sucks, and maybe a tad senile <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> so a colour-coded schematic makes reading it much easier. He felt it necessary to make fun of that idea too. Having it at print-res means that I can run it over to Kinkos and have a full-size 36maybe a to print mad of it for easy reference and personal annotation.<br /><br />If I can get the original Nintendo FC schematics, I'd just copy them (enlarged) for myself, but it's easier to redraw them. Just don't be shocked if I scan stuff and only share it with people that like and trust from now on. I also have some weird stuff on the way to me (the Sharp Twin RF modulator, for example) and I'll do a pinout for it. I find having this stuff all in one place useful, and my goal was to make it easier to find, but apparently he misconstrued that, and instead of PMing me about it, he publicly attempted to ridicule and humiliate me. That'.s nonsense, especially considering the amount of work and money I'm putting into development projects for a console that hasn't been manufactured in sixteen years.<br /><br />Then again, at least a few people appreciated my sharing of this information, so perhaps after the Xanax kicks in I'll feel nice about it again. I'll stick the pinouts up on the wiki at least, so they are revised and original content, drawing from information of others who are credited in the text file. I just don't know how many people care about these sorts of things at this point, and getting bashed for posting them is a sure way to make me want to to just hoard it all.<br /><br />I found it insulting, that's all. My intent is to make people aware that they exist, and maybe improve on them by redrawing, a word that he criticized as well ('schematic capture' implies an original design, not a re-capture from existing schematics IMO). Talk about a swift kick in the rear; I just have zero tolerance for that kind of thing. I won''t hold a grudge, but I'm not going to just sit there and take abuse from <em>anybody</em>.<br /><br />@Tepples: Good info there, thanks!. I had a feeling that schematics fell into their own category. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Now I'm going to go to bed so that I may awaken to start making preparations for my long-overdo one-day vacation.

I think the point was that<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><br />My only work (which was countless hours of poking about searching for stuff in Japanese) was in finding and assembling them into a collection<br /></div><br />involved merely mirroring the images on <a href="http://www2.odn.ne.jp/~haf09260/Famic/Famic.htm" class="postlink">Enri's page</a>.<br /><br />As a test, I just tried downloading his site, then picking the schematics out. Total time spent: 2 minutes. Result: folder of 21 schematic PNGs, as compared to the 23 in your linked folder.<br /><br />Going back to what kyuusaku said:<br /><div class="quotetitle">kyuusaku wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Wow, so you mean you went through all the trouble of finding Enri's homepage and downloading his schematics?! Mad props!<br /></div><br />Is there any factual error in this statement? I don't understand why you're up in arms about his comment.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17">blargg</a> — Sun Sep 12, 2010 4:26 am</p><hr />

<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.odn.ne.jp%2F~haf09260%2FFamic%2FFamic.htm" class="postlink">This</a> is what the site that hosts them looks like in Google translations. I originally found them a while back and never bookmarked the site, but I didn't see a name or anything on it until I clicked on the home link all the way at the bottom of the page after being given a link by kyuusaku.<br /><br />Aside from the reference URL, there is an email address I didn't notice on the homepage (which is a portal about all sorts of consoles and computers). It looks like a Japanese collection of data, but maybe whomever Enri is made them all. I'm not sure, because of the lack of any copyright mention and also stuff like this:<br /><br />ほとんどが内部解析（モドキ）なので内容が変る場合があります。<br /><br />As far as I can tell, Enri wrote the articles about the diagrams and explained quite a lot about them, but there is no mention if Enri made the drawings or if the came from another source, however it is more than likely the case that they are his (or hers?) originally. <br /><br />If  bothered to credit 'Kevin Horton, Ben Heckendorn, and all the folks at NESdev.' on a basic pinout that I did for the NES to FC EXP ports, why would I bother not to credit whomever did these? Frankly, because I hadn't any idea who made them when I posted the links. <br />I didn't credit anybody, and I didn't attempt to steal the credit for them, so I guess just posting links to them makes me pretentious even though apparently only one other person here seems to have seen them before. <br /><br />Redrawing a schematic and copyrights though, is a sticky area. Is it enough of a change to claim originality? Well, the only changes are cosmetic, so changes like this are up to a court to decide. In reality, Nintendo is still the copyright holder of a derivative work like this, both because it is not changing how the design of the circuits operates and because they have enough money and lawyers to enforce ownership.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4070">Xious</a> — Sun Sep 12, 2010 2:11 am</p><hr />
