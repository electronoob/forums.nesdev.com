<br />
<br />I fixed a famicom disk system a long time ago (usual problem, the melted strap) and it seemed to work fine.. But it's not.  After using it for a while, the strap seems to slip and jam.
<br />
<br />Did anybody had a similar issue?

<br />Argg.. The strap was doing this since the begining and I thought it was just a setting. Never had time to tweak it.  Could it be that I either made it loose by accident while installing it or it was already not right from the get go?

<br />I know the powerpak would be useful but since I have original games.. I would like to be able to use them <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

<br />From experience repairing belt-drive phonographs, it seems most likely the belt was slightly wrong at the beginning...

<br />This is what I was concerned.  But the shop I bought it from was a well known one.  Oh well.

<br />
<br />Because the drive spindle/motor is the most finicky thing on the planet.  The length of the band has to be exact and the tension of the band has to be exact.
<br />
<br />You can't use a rubber band for a couple reasons: 1) it's elasticity is too high compared to the real FDS belt (which is a plastic-rubber belt that *does not* expand/contract when pulled), and 2) rubber bands are often square or round (when viewed length-wise or from a cross-section view), which means as the motors turn, the band wiggles itself off the drive spindle.
<br />
<br />The drive does let you adjust it using a couple user-accessible pots, but in most cases touching those makes things worse.  I'm not sure what the two pots control either, aside from drive or head timings.
<br />
<br />I speak from experience.  I had an FDS which I gave away (to Matt Conte).  I initially tried repairing it using rubber bands + adjusting said pots, but the end result was failure or the rubber band working itself off the spindle after a few sections of operation.
<br />
<br />I ended up just buying a working FDS off eBay and called it a done deal.

<br />
<br />I could always by one since the price here must be more reasonable than on ebay but I still don't know if it worth it or not. I don't have that much game yet but I always prefer to own the original when the price is affordable.
