I use C++ Builder for two reasons: I know it well and use for 10 years now, and I have a free license, the Turbo C++ cut down version.<br /><br />My choice of C++ Builder over a free software is because it allows me to do the job very fast, i.e. makes it doable in general. Sorry, I don't have time to learn a free GUI lib like Qt or GTK to a level comparable with my experience with VCL, and from what I know about these, it'll take much longer than with VCL anyway (because they are just libs, not RAD tools).<br /><br />I'm agree that there is major problem with it being not free and not crossplatform. Also, it is a real pity that they removed the free version and that it is overpriced so much. But I can't do anything with it. For my projects, either it will be that way, or console and SDL-based tools only (people don't like these), or nothing at all.<br /><br /><br />Actually, this problem arises often with large scale hobbyist projects. Take FamiTracker, for example - a great project, but you can't build it without buying Visual Studio, because the free version does not have MFC, and even if you'll hook the one from the Platform SDK, it won't work (old version there).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4205">Shiru</a> — Tue May 08, 2012 8:04 pm</p><hr />

This is about trouble buying Borland C++ Builder for building my own version of Shiru's Screen Tool<br /><br />First of all, It is now too expensive for buying it, That means it costs US $3,400 plus shipping... I do NOT approve of gigantic prices...<br /><br />Second is an alternative... Porting it to a free language such as C, so that it can use your own choice of dependancies, as well as being cross-platform.<br /><br />#2 is the great choice for Screen Tool, But the thing is I cannot program C or CPP. so as a note to Shiru, Please port it to some other free language.<br /><br />Sorry for this, I am being anxious.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=287">Hamtaro126</a> — Tue May 08, 2012 7:42 pm</p><hr />
