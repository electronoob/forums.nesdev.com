		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In an SMB hack I worked on, we expanded the ROM by moving the music data and code to a dedicated bank. This freed up a huge amount of space for lots of hacks.<br /><br />The reset vector was changed to point to the mapper initialization routine, which jumped to the original init routine once it was setup. The music routine was replaced with a stub that swapped the music bank in, ran the original, and switched back. It all seemed to work pretty well.<br /><br />The code was based on a version of Doppleganger's disassembly that was modified to build with the cc65 toolchain. This made making changes much easier than hex editing or whatever.

Well i guess it will but you'll have a patch that as you said basically contains a significant portion of copyrighted data.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Too true Tepples, but keep in mind that in the US, anyone can make and impose that decision upon you with a law suit. Even if the claim doesn't hold in court, the act of being filed is often detrimental enough to cause a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect" class="postlink">chilling effect</a>.<br /><br />It wouldn't be too terribly difficult to construct a diff and patch utility that would describe an output file as a series of offset and length pairs of an existing reference file, and only include raw data when a sequence of two or more bytes does not appear in the reference file. That way the patch is guaranteed not to contain any data from the original.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have only one method of determining if something what I host on my own site is illegal or not: If court orders me to take it down, then it is illegal. If some private company (say, Pretenda Law) tells me to do it, I say to them show me court order. If they fail to do so, I conclude what I'm doing is in legal boundaries. And for DMCA notices? My site isn't hosted in U.S., so if I get one, I tell them to give me any reason to listen to U.S. law when I and my site lives in europe.
