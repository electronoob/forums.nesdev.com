A while ago (about a week ago) while I was modding my original NES for the audio mod (I was also trying to tweak the video circuit) I zapped 13v on the 5V circuitry of the console.  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> <br /><br />Of course it failed instandly. Because it has G revision chips all I would get was a solid gray screen. I knew it was busted. <br /><br />I didn't panic though and went straight to the CPU -WRAM chip. Removed it and found it had two bits blown (D1 and D6) which effectively prevented the CPU from starting. Replaced it with another 6116 SRAM chip and the little beast was healthy again ! <br /><br /><br />What a relief !<br /><br />May this be of help for other unfortunate people who zap their NES or Famicom with such high voltages ...  <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4943">l_oliveira</a> — Sun Jan 15, 2012 7:40 am</p><hr />

Sounds like you've got an interference or transmission line issue.<br /><br />What do you have going on exactly?  Any good pics?  Is it the original NES video amp?  Did you reroute or extend some video lines with some standard wire?  If so, and if I happen right, it's possible that you could fix the issue by rerunning those modified/extended lines with some small coax instead.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sat Jan 14, 2012 10:29 pm</p><hr />

Sorry to re-visit an old topic, but thought it might be better than posting the same exact question.<br /><br />I also have a loud buzzing sound coming from the TV with my nintoaster mod.  I have narrowed it down to the VIDEO AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT, or at least I can stop the buzzing by touching two leads of the TRANSISTOR with my bare finger, or by clipping an alligator clip on one of the legs.<br /><br />This is rather wierd to me and I can't figure it out.<br /><br />Any ideas would be most appreciated.  <br /><br />I completely rebuilt the circuit twice now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5155">rbrande1</a> — Sat Jan 14, 2012 10:15 pm</p><hr />

The Buzzing you heard the initial time you turned it on may have been noise from the AC-adapter. If it sounded something inbetween a low B and B-flat (America; 60Hz), or like a low G (Europe; 50Hz), then this certainly is the case. I don't think you have any ground-faults, as the problems would be much worse then; you described is as a "Slight humming noise".<br /><br />From previous experimentation, I have gotten similar noises (in addition to lines on the TV) in the case the AC adapter has been unable to provide enough current. It should at least be able to provide up to 1A, as the original adapter from Nintendo does 1.3A. However, this is not the only case where this phenomenon occurs.<br /><br />From my point of view, it may just be a case of bad shielding. An AC mains line will create a quite noticable oscillating magnetic field, which will induce current in surrounding elements. In the original NES, the AC line was reduced to "unregulated 9V AC" (Read: "13V AC"), which cause less induction, in addition to the fact that the NES has been properly shielded. Even the RC modulator (where the recifier is), is being shielded separately.<br /><br />So, what kind of toaster do you use? How much of the cover is made of metal? And; Do you use a grounded AC outlet/cable?<br /><br />---<br /><br />I am also working on making a Nintoaster at the moment, and I have decided to use an external DC supply, in addition to the original RF modulator (slightly modified due to faulty recifier). What I use for wiering is old steel solid-core blasting-cap wire (about wire-gauge 20).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4904">person</a> — Thu Jul 07, 2011 2:26 am</p><hr />

Solder wick might also help to clean up some solder.<br /><br />Are you able to post pics of your project? Is there anything that looks burnt at all?

It's great stuff.  If things are falling off I highly doubt it's because it's too thin.  If your connections are weak it's because your solder joints are weak.  And if your solder joints are weak you've most likely got a dirty solder joint.  You'll know because you'll have a hard time getting the solder to stick to anything.  A clean joint will cause the solder to flow wherever the heat is and you'll have no problem making connecitons.  I think they sell flux pens at radio shack.<br /><br />You should be able to "tin" the board contact and wire easily if they're clean and fluxed up.  Tinning means just to coat them with solder.  Then it's cake to make the connection, just place the wire where you want it and heat it up.  You won't have to hold the solder with your third hand because the wire and connection already have ample solder.<br /><br />Just to give you an idea whats possible with this method here's a picture of a related project of mine: <img src="http://www.infiniteneslives.com/img/images/60to72pin.jpg" alt="Image" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Tue Jul 05, 2011 9:40 pm</p><hr />

So, first I moved all of the ground wires closer to each other, as well as tried to seperate the gound from the AC adaptor, but in the process I broke one of the <br /><br />&lt;snip&gt;<br /><br />when I had it working with the buzzing noise, but it only gives a blank screen now. I honestly can not figure out what is wrong. Could the short in the connections have fried the board and/or the Game Genie connector?  And is there any way to test or see if any component is broken?<br /></div><br /><br />Did you power it up, while the ground to the 7805 was lifted?  If so, unregulated 13V probably went into the board and popped some chips.  Without a ground, the 7805 will not regulate, and acts as a fancy wire, basically.  <br /><br />Shorting stuff on the 72 pin connector probably isn't going to hurt anything- sure it won't work but if you break the short it's going to work again.  <br /><br />One time I blew up an NES because I had unscrewed that little PCB with the power/reset switches on it, and it was flopping around and happened to hit one of the data lines on the main PCB.  Since the power switch is controlling the rectified DC (around 12-13 volts) this blew up every chip connected to the data bus.  I did manage to fix it, but it required replacing the EPROM, CPU, and 6522 on the copyNES board,  the PPU, the two 74HC368 chips (Controller inputs), and the RAM chip on the main board... basically most of the chips.<br /><br />You might be luckier than I was though;  it could still just be a short or open somewhere.<br /><br />Next time, you can eliminate the hum by careful grounding:<br /><br />Connect the ground from the power adapter, audio/video jacks, and 7805 and video amplifier to the ground on the NES board right where the modulator was.  Connect them all to the SAME point.  Also, how are you providing the power to run the NES?  Are you using a full wave rectifier?  If it's half-wave (i.e. a single diode) then that could cause some hum in an otherwise hum-free circuit.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=230">kevtris</a> — Tue Jul 05, 2011 9:03 am</p><hr />

If you don't know what you shorted together your only real hope is crack it open and look at all the components and see if you can see anything that's visibly fried.  Chances are you won't but it sounds like its your only hope.<br /><br />If you had another broken NES it may be possible to make one good one assuming different parts are dead.  That's about the only thing it's useful for...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4832">infiniteneslives</a> — Sun Jul 03, 2011 12:24 am</p><hr />

That's what I had figured also, but I was wondering if there was any way to salvage it, or if there was any way to pinpoint exactly what it broke?  Or would a short like this just fry the whole board?<br /><br />Are there anymore specific details I could provide that would help (besides exactly which 2 pins were shorted)?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4925">Canite</a> — Sat Jul 02, 2011 8:12 pm</p><hr />
