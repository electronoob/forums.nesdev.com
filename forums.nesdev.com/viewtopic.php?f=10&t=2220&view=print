		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, I'm a noob. I understand the basics of 6502 assembly, and I really want to apply that to programming for the NES. I've found lots of information about what assemblers <em>not</em> to use and what tutorials <em>not</em> to follow. Can anybody tell me specifically what assembler <em>to</em> use and what tutorials <em>to</em> follow?
<br />
<br />It's bogus spending hours and hours learning to use an assembler like NESASM only to be told that it's for "beginners" and you need to switch to something else, or to follow a tutorial and then have people tell you "the guy who wrote that didn't know what he was talking about and you should forget everything in it". What assembler is best for advanced programming? CC65? WLA DX? If you were a Hudson Soft or Konami employee what assembler would you be using? Is Neshla not even being updated anymore?
<br />
<br />Are there any tutorials that were written by people who actually knew what they were talking about? Especially ones that don't start by teaching you how to draw a happy face on the screen and end with "Or something like that, I'm not really sure about it, but you can figure it out on your own. Dumb smiley face. I'll cover scrolling, collision detection, and all the other things that you actually have to know in order to actually make a game in a future tutorial. This tutorial will be updated regularly! Last update September 17 2001"?
<br />
<br />I apologize if these questions have been answered repeatedly or if they sound "dumb". As other people have mentioned the search function doesn't function and it's difficult to find information based on message titles.

<br />Probably ca65 (cc65 without the inefficient C compiler). If I wanted to do high level assembly, I'd implement a compiler that spits out source code suitable for ca65.

<br />
<br />Actuall most tutorials are okay exept GBAGuy's. So just avoid it.

There is nothing wrong with starting out with nesasm.  I started out with it.  However, as you learn more and expand your games (or demos) you'll want to switch to a more flexible compiler.  I've recently switched to wla-dx.

<br />
<br />I haven't done assembly programming for anything other than the NES. I started learning last year (mostly using NESASM) but when I switched computers I never got around to copying the files over. Now that I have I've decided to start over from the beginning so I can try to actually understand everything. So instead of going for NES tutorials I read 6502 documents so I could actually understand what things do rather than just following "do this because it works" examples. But when it comes to actually applying it to the NES, there are a lot of documents that seem to say different things and I don't know which ones to trust.
<br />
<br />When you say ca65, do you mean specifically the file ca65.exe that's part of the CC65 package?
<br />
<br />Is there anything in the NES 101 document that doesn't apply to using CA65, or anything to look out for that might be different? I tried using NES 101 last year but I vaguely remember there being something in it that didn't work with NESASM so I ended up using a different tutorial that was written for NESASM (which I can't find now, but it wasn't GBAGuy's).

<br />Yes. Use ca65 to assemble and ld65 to link. I don't like to call the cc65 package with the C compiler removed "cc65" because people will think I'm talking about the C compiler itself, which is both inefficient and non-free. The remainder of the package, ca65+ld65+ar65, is free software and analogous to GNU Binutils.

<br />In three minutes I found <a href="http://neshla.sourceforge.net/preprocessor/index.html#files" class="postlink">NESHLA .incbin</a>. I think <a href="http://neshla.sourceforge.net/variables/manipulators.html#arrays" class="postlink">arrays</a> correspond to .db.
<br />
<br />But yes, NESHLA is a different language, and it's different from the bare metal experience of CA65 or P65.
