		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If people made games for purchase on it, it seems that it wouldn't be a NES, just a NES-like platform. The game would have to work properly on your emulator, since that's what people are paying to play it on, so any differences from NES would have to be accommodated by the games. And you could't fix emulator bugs since it would break previous games (unless you are able to tie each game to a specific emulator version). Even ignoring these unwanted sources of inaccuracy, since the emulator would be the only target, you'd want to add things to make split-screen easier, give more CPU time, etc. These are easy to do and make game development simpler.<br /><br />It would be an interesting way to sell homebrew NES games without high production costs and without worries over unwanted sharing. In fact, worries over unwanted sharing would actually encourage making the emulator work somewhat differently than NES to prevent playing any leaked game ROMs on NES emulators or NES hardware. Simple approaches would be to change the memory map, e.g. RAM in a different place, PPU/APU registers elsewhere.

I imagine the idea is that some games will be made available on Ouya and on an NES cartridge, and someone who owns both an Ouya and an NES might play the free demo on the Ouya Store and decide to buy it on cartridge.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And you could't fix emulator bugs since it would break previous games (unless you are able to tie each game to a specific emulator version).</div><br />Hence the different IOS binaries in the Wii system software and the emulator binaries in Virtual Console.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Simple approaches would be to change the memory map, e.g. RAM in a different place, PPU/APU registers elsewhere.</div><br />Hence the palette rearrangement in the 2C04 and the swapping of addresses of PPUCTRL/PPUMASK in the 2C05. &quot;RAM in a different place&quot; wouldn't work because the 6502-derived core in all 2A0x family CPUs depends on having the direct page at $0000-$00FF and the stack at $0100-$01FF.<br /><br />Of course this whole plan would need to be modified if the Ouya Store distribution agreement has a non-compete clause like that of the App Store and Google Play Store that prohibits applications from acting as app stores themselves. In such a case, you'd need to distribute your emulator as a tool to package a single ROM, much like Virtual Console for Wii and Macifom for iOS.

In that case, I wonder how easy it'd be to watermark the ROM on decryption by adding obfuscated copies of the IMEI or other buyer-identifying information in various parts of the ROM. For example, it could be hidden in an unused tile, a grass tile, etc. The buyer's name could be stored in the title screen. That way, a decrypted ROM inappropriately distributed to the public could be traced to the buyer. Apple does this with DRM-free M4A tracks sold through the iTunes store.

If we tried to cut them out, they probably would not be very happy about it.<br /><br />Also, I'll let you choose how much you feel the store is worth to you. So, if you want nothing to go to the store, the cut is between you and Ouya only. I think that is fair given all possible outcomes.
