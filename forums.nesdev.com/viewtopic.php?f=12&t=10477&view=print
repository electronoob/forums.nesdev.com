Here is the simple mod to do so.<br /><br />I am in no way claiming this was my mod, credit goes to the person I bought this from and sorry I cannot remember who you are. Chime in if you are here if you want.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe that it is capable of 2 players with the addition of the second gun.   First gun plugs into the console.   Second gun (which does NOT have a snes controller connector) plugs into a &quot;phone&quot; type connector into the first gun.  SO player 2 gun originally had a cable that terminated with a phone type connector that plugs into the first gun.  I assume that the circuit board in the player 2 gun is different???<br />Anyways, that about all i know about it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The &quot;phone type cable&quot; to connect the two seems pretty standard 6 wires match at both ends.<br /><br />As for two players. As far as I know you cannot plug 2 player 1 (blue guns) into each controller port. However I could be wrong though as I have never actually tried it. <br /><br />Both guns are identical inside one wired to the SNES port and one wired to the &quot;phone jack style&quot; port. Both guns basically run off SNES controller port 1.

And I think the pink gun is differently wired inside..........but I could be wrong...maybe it is just the different connector...<br />There a video on youtube of a guy using 2 guns playing.........I'll try to find it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The SNES controller port 2 is special. The IObit line, when changed, latches the H/V counters which copies the current raster position of the PPU (the x,y coordinate of the current pixel being output). Light guns watch for the CRT beam cannon, and flip that bit when they see it. Along with an &quot;adjust your aim&quot; screen to offset for the latency, this is how the light guns (including the Super Scope and MACS), work.<br /><br />So if you plug the controller into port 1, it functions fine, but it won't latch the counters, because that's just how the system was designed. You could write software to probe PIO constantly to see when that controller's IObit changes, and manually latch the counters, but that would eat up all of your CPU time for the entire frame, so no software does it.<br /><br />This is why the Justifier setup uses daisy chaining on controller port 2. With the second controller, they take turns each frame sending just one gun's data.<br /><br />So, with special made homebrew, it'd be possible to craft a game that uses four light gun players, but the processing would be limited to about ~20% of the SNES' already anemic CPU power.<br /><br />I'm sure that bit of trivia will prove very valuable to you all in the future :P
