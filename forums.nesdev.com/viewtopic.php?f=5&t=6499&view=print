		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />While on my trip to Akihabara to buy the latest psp import game from the States from <a href="http://nesdev.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=6487&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=24" class="postlink">the guy that slap his thing on ps3 dev kit to mark is territory</a> (I found the comment funny in a weird way), I ended up in a new retro game shop. They opened a new Trader on the main street so I wanted to check if they had any new old things.  To my surprise, there was a video of Battle kid playing so I decided to go check why. They actually were offering money (4000 yen) to anybody that could sell the game to them.  Usually those guys gives almost nothing so I guess there is a demand for that game in japan somehow.
<br />
<br />Of course Akihabara is a geek place but it's the first time that I saw an appearance of Battle kid around here.  So if you make some new nes homebrew that sells, it may even ends up in japan.  Games have no frontiers I guess <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been pretty curious about buying Famicom cases so I could make stuff.  There was a company I had contacted about it once, their site mentioned "8-bit games" among their products.  But they wanted me to send them the ROM to see if they can make it, I don't know if they understood or if I explained properly that I needed to use my own board.  That was maybe 5 or 6 years ago, I wonder if their still doing that stuff.  I'm not even sure where my email archive is from that long ago, so I can't look it up too easily.
