More recently I figured I would probably just use submappers of that number for my other boards.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It's hard to want to translate information from emulator source without something more authoritative, or at least implementation notes from an emulator author when they were reimplementing (and therefore presumably verified, and nothing's bitrotted, and they're still around to talk to if it is wrong)<br />For example, Nestopia's source claims mapper 54 maps to &quot;BMC NOVELDIAMOND 9999999-IN-1&quot;, which he implemented as something similar to m107.<br />And, as accurate as the emulation of the core is, Nestopia erroneously refiled Namco's 175 and 340 back in with the 163, so one can't simply accept what's there as authoritative.

If you squat on a particular mapper number, and an update to your favorite emulator or your FPGA flash adapter's mapper pack includes an implementation of a newly registered mapper with the same number, then either you won't be able to run the image that uses that registered mapper, or you won't be able to run the image that you're developing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't understand how that is an issue, though... If you're developing with a custom mapper, you've modified the emulator or FPGA program yourself. If you need to take an update (why?), you have to reapply the changes, the same as you did in the first place.<br /><br />It seems entirely inconsequential to me whether I would choose to use mapper 248 or 30 or 10 or 150 or 2 for internal development.<br /><br />I think we could make use of it if someone were to write an emulator for which a specific mapper number would mean to look for a plugin DLL that accompanies the ROM, enabling people to distribute their new mapper alongside the ROM. Unfortunately, I wouldn't forsee anything like that ever becoming standardized, so it would be specific to one emulator. (I know zzo38 has sketched some thoughts on mapper plugins with this kind of thing in mind too, just I don't imagine there is enough need for it that it would be worth implementing.)<br /><br />In my own practice, it was trivially easy for me to distribute a modified build of FCEUX to anyone I wanted to help test the ROM. I can't think of a situation that choosing mapper 248 would have made any easier...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />PowerPak implements all mappers through the equivalent of plug-in DLLs. It stores its FPGA fusemaps in individual files numbered after the iNES mapper number converted to hex: MMC3 in MAP04.MAP, BNROM and NINA in MAP22.MAP, Cheetahmen II in MAPE4.MAP, and Action 53 in MAP1C.MAP. Say you squat on a mapper number and distribute an implementation for the PowerPak to beta testers along with your ROM. If your squatted mapper number becomes registered, someone may make a mapper update that includes the new mapper. Installing this mapper update would clobber your beta mapper, causing your game to stop working as the FPGA uses the behavior of the newly registered mapper instead of your mapper. In order to both play the game that uses the newly registered mapper and test your game, your beta tester would have to buy and use two separate CF cards.<br /><br />Private-use mapper numbers are mapper numbers that you can be reasonably sure won't get clobbered in a mapper plug-in update. It's the same reason Unicode has private-use blocks.

There's also gonna be some weird case, I'm not convinced it's worth losing sleep over. Much like rainwarrior, I don't see how use of 248 fixes any problems over picking any other random &quot;unallocated&quot; one.

Possibly it could happen on the Everdrive, but if you're testing a game for somebody, all this means is you copy one more file over after the update. This would only be a problem if you are trying to switch between multiple new games frequently that both want to use the same mapper (which is actually much more likely to happen if they all use mapper 248 as a rule), which... seems an unlikely issue. Custom mapper homebrew is a tiny subset of the already small homebrew collection.
