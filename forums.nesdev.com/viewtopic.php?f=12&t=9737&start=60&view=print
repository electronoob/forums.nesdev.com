I say &quot;twice as big&quot; to work around the possibility of power loss while copying.</div><br />Well, we know empirically the battery protection circuit as used in SNES cartridges is pretty bulletproof as far as powering on and off, except for that obvious problem of shutting off while saving. (Have there really ever been any complaints? I never heard about it from anyone growing up... It was always the little brother going in and deleting something).<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the SNES Zelda: A Link to the Past does use kind of the method you're talking about (double sized). The SRAM holds two copies of every save file... if it sees the first one as corrupt, it'll try to use the second. I bet there are other games that do that too.<br /><br />Off the top of my head bugginess causing savegame problems... RPM racing track editor, Stunt Race FX beat the game then play one of the topmost Radio Control tracks (have to select the track while the screen is still scrolling up), Secret of Mana and Secret of Evermore. But whatever. My point is that I've never had a game delete just because I turned the system on or turned it off (outside of the do not shut off power, saving... portion).<br /><br /><br />copying to flash has its own problems, especially if it also contains a bootloader:<br /><br />Flash can get corrupted by a bad write on poweroff during a block write sequence or buggy code, then not correctly boot anymore. As evidenced by the N64 Gameshark. (making too many changes to the cheat list, where &quot;too many&quot; is hard to quantify).<br /><br />Flash does have an unlock sequence to avoid trivial writes, but it still matters where you write as the erase process takes out an entire block at once (so you have to write both the new data and the data you don't want changed back). Flash also has the terrific erase entire chip command that takes a few seconds to complete and can't be stopped.<br /><br />As for a new game, I don't see why hiding your save file in the flash chip would be inherently bad, if you were careful to select a chip that does have a boot block, or stay out of the block that contains code.<br />this is an application note that talks about it... just a few pages...<br /><a href="http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/SGSThomsonMicroelectronics/mXyxszv.pdf" class="postlink">AN1158 Uniform vs Boot Block Flash Architecture</a>

These have uniform blocks about 4K in size. But some of those chips' densities are closer to NES game size than Super NES game size.

The BA6162 compares a fixed voltage (probably a 1.25V temperature-independent reference) against a simple resistor divider, with 100mV of hysteresis. When that's in favor, it uses a Sziklai pair to connect Vcc to Vout. Otherwise, the battery provides power to Vout through a Schottky diode, a self-biased NPN BJT (to relieve current load from the diode?), and some resistors.<br /><br />For anyone asking &quot;why didn't Big N use a bunch of discretes?&quot;: because <em>they</em> could buy battery backup ICs for 30c/, but you have to for $2/. And at $2/ we can get you something pretty good in discretes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey everyone, so I am working right now on how to implement an LS139 and a simple backup circuit to replace the MAD-1 in LOROM games. I have already successfully gotten HIROM games to work properly without the MAD-1 (as mentioned earlier in this thread).<br /><br />Currently I can get any game 16Mbit and lower to load and save properly. But any game above 16mbit will not even load. Magno has been helping me with this a bit, but we haven't had any luck yet. I can't see why it isn't possible, as the HIROM carts work fine (wired differently of course).<br /><br />My current '139 wiring design is this (traced this from a Zelda LTTP cart):<br /><br />1. CART #49|||16. VCC<br />2. A20 (46) |||||15. '139 PIN 7<br />3. A21 (47)|||||14. A19 (45)<br />4. ROM /OE1 ||13. /RESET<br />5. NC |||||||||12. NC<br />6. NC |||||||||11. NC<br />7. '139 #15|||||10. NC<br />8. GND |||||||||9. SRAM /CE<br /><br />Now, when I compare this to the MAD-1 in a lorom board I do notice that A15 is hooked up to the MAD-1. I have tried wiring that in place of A19 and /RESET, but no dice. I'm assuming that I need to have A15 involved somehow, but I thought Lorom ignored A15 anyways?<br /><br />Can anyone help me out?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I must me missing the context here as this makes NO sense.<br /><br />This list is only a small portion of the connections going on between the ROM, MAD/decoder, SRAM, and cart connector.  If you can provide a schematic (pinout listing) which includes the entirety of the board and chips I can probably point you in the right direction.  I know...  doesn't sound like fun...  But you might even realize your mistake yourself if you take the time to draw out the ENTIRE thing.  Damn near anything can break the cart, there are 100's of things that have to be done correctly to ensure operation and your short list doesn't come close.

If you just want the connections I'd suggest referring to schematics of Lo-ROM boards that don't use the MAD1.

You previously enabled when /ROMSEL was low, but you should only be doing it when /ROMSEL=0 <strong>AND</strong> A15=1.  I don't know how to make the logic more clear, if you can't figure out how to do it with the '139 just add another chip or two or three.
