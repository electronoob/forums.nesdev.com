For example, in <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=3321669&amp;cid=42325571" class="postlink">this post</a>, &quot;expert system&quot; has a specific meaning. By writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system" class="postlink">expert system</a>, I'm saying &quot;expert system as that article defines expert system&quot;. This is especially true of storytelling patterns, as one community cataloging all the storytelling patterns has developed a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TVTropesWillRuinYourVocabulary" class="postlink">set of terminology that the public might not get</a>. </li><li>Or I might be striking a balance between the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" class="postlink">comedic principle of not explaining the joke</a> with the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" class="postlink">risk that users might not get it</a>. If you get it, great; you don't have to follow the citation. But if you don't, you can read the cited page and then reread my post with the cited page fresh in your mind, and when you hit the punchline, it'll suddenly make sense. </li></ul><br />In any case, if you still don't understand a joke in one of my posts, I encourage you to send me a private message.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />(Darn it. Denine, ninja'd me here... and then Dwedit. I write too much.)<br />I'm also with Tepples on &quot;this post&quot;. I too see it like handing someone information or pointing to something and saying &quot;read this.&quot; So it works just as well for me when read aloud. But I guess it's strange... read that would be used (by me at least) interchangeably in a  &quot;real life&quot; situation like the above (Throw article on someone's desk. &quot;Read that and get back to me&quot;), but it sounds wrong to me online. <br /><br />If you replaced page with article in your example, blargg, it would make sense. Only certain words create the ambiguous situation you're concerned about. <br /><br />I sometimes do something like this:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.aseprite.org/">http://www.aseprite.org/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />That program is a really cool pixel animation program.<br /></div><br />But I would not do this:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"><a href="http://www.aseprite.org/" class="postlink">That program</a> is a really cool pixel animation program.<br /></div><br />I'm not sure why I wouldn't do the second one, or even why I prefer the first. I prefer &quot;this program&quot; with a link to both of the &quot;that&quot; solutions, though.<br /><br />Edit: And now I'm considering other forms of self referential text. <br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This book contains a list of excellent resources for programming. <br />Made Up Title C Book:<br />This book is excellent in that it teaches blah blah in a basic way.<br /></div><br />Heh. So I guess it is weird in context like that, and I just didn't notice it on forums. Is using &quot;that&quot; really the &quot;proper&quot; way?<br />Edit2: And again, it's only weird when the types of works are the same.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This book contains a list of excellent resources for programming. <br />Microsoft Visual Studio 2010:<br />This program is excellent because blah blah blah.<br /></div><br />I wouldn't bat an eyelash at the above. Weird!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> For the above examples you could just use the name of the works in question instead of this or that, but that's not so for posts. Maybe I'll start using &quot;In a post by X&quot;.

I prefer &quot;this program&quot; with a link to both of the &quot;that&quot; solutions, though.<br /></div><br />Yeah, those examples make a good point. To use &quot;that&quot;, you must have already established the referent. Doing it simultaneously with a link doesn't work. It seems best to use some descriptive text, like &quot;<a href="http://www.aseprite.org/" class="postlink">Aseprite</a> is a really cool pixel animation program.&quot; or &quot;In a [url=blabla]recent posting[/url] someone explained bla bla...&quot; You might then say &quot;that posting&quot; in the same paragraph, but the link would be on the first mention before you have anything to refer to with &quot;that&quot;. I still think that linked text starting with &quot;this&quot; is on the level of a &quot;here&quot; link, and that it subtly disrupts flow slightly by jumping abstraction levels. When I'm reading, I think of my comprehension working on several levels separately. Part is reading, another part is asking whether I know what's being referred to and seeing whether the thing mentioned is worth looking at. A &quot;this&quot; or &quot;click here&quot; is sort of like a dependency between them, which blocks one while the other figures out what it means.<br /><br />I'm just sharing my own thoughts and perceptions on the subject, and am finding others' ideas interesting. And yes, tepples' posting style is chock full of useful links to more information.
