Right now our game starts out drawing my sister's first two nametables and attribute tables.  My most recent goal has been to successfully scroll into a third screen.  So far I have code that draws two 8 bit wide columns... and the attribute tables part isn't working for some reason... but, you just have to specify a value 0 through F and the selected 16 bit wide column will be drawn correctly!  Now my next step was to achieve scrolling into a third screen, but you have changed that... my new next step goal is to set the game so that the camera adjusts to our ladie's starting point in the level.  This is going to require more thought but it's a new goal - I'm satisfied with it!  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I believe you should work with a single table, if your game scrolls one way. Use basically a revolving door. Keep the next column, bytes of attributes to update, etc. in a RAM buffer. You don't need to look at it as two screens and you scroll to a third, it's a single screen that you scroll to another on. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Basically, keep either 30 or 60 bytes (One or two columns vertically) of tiles to write to wherever they go, and then eight bytes or however many for the updated attribute data that you need to add after. Shove it all to the PPU, but then also shove it to a big &quot;Nametable Current&quot; buffer that is like a binary number, when it overflows, it doesn't go to the &quot;2nd nametable&quot; row then back to the first. It would go back onto it's self, so you basically only have one screen of data in it at a time...I mean, unless you're showing two screens at once. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> But I mean if that works, you can keep it like that, I don't exactly know how your engine is set up, that way might be better for what you have, but I'm not sure. Just my input on that. It's something that if it works, I wouldn't change it. But you can do it later if you want to save RAM, or just to change how the scrolling works.

It would go back onto it's self, so you basically only have one screen of data in it at a time...</div>Thank you 3gengames, I think I understand what you mean. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  We will have to have 2 screens of data I think... a lot to think about....

Just have to make the buffer go forward and backward in writes, nothing too bad.
