It's all about code cleanness and modularity. A debug function - we could even call it a supervisor for the sake of it - is conditionally called at the beginning of the instruction fetch/decode loop. This function checks, prior to the execution of the instruction and consumption of cycles, whether it will trip a break condition. <br /><br />Now, beware's own coding guidelines are saying that the debug functionality is separate from the emulation. Essentially, the only interface between the two is that single conditional call. Debugging functionality is allowed to slow down the emulation, under the condition that it can be disabled very efficiently. This implies that the debug code isn't relied upon for normal emulation. This also means that debug code is not allowed to alter the state of the emulated machine, only break the emulation.<br /><br />The other option is to place a OAM conditional in the read/write functions, which isn't exactly very attracive either. I and beware have discussed this a lot, and what really made the difference is that literally nothing, except for one game made by an asshole in France, relies on the effects of illegal memory access during DMA. But more importantly, it really has no practical uses, apart from emulator detection, so he ended up deciding it was too much cost (in terms of both speed and code complexity) for too little benefit.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, beware finds emulation accuracy very important, but there's a trade-off to everything.

Ugh! Yeah, that's all wrong. That behaves as if the CPU is halted while the OAM DMA is happening. In the end, it was really just a timing error from &quot;somewhere else&quot;. Right now I have breakpoints all over the place in BGB (beware's emulator; I will personally call your emulator bgameboy in the future to disambiguate it.) in the DKL ROM to look for suspicious stuff that might break. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">byuu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Just implemented the transfer in parallel as an initial test, and the problem remains fixed. But man, that's a painful operation to do. I have to hook the OAM DMA transfer test in every clock tick of the CPU, and all of my opcode read/write functions need to also test for it and reject reads outside of HRAM.<br /></div>If it's any comfort, beware has decided against emulating the OAM inaccessibility accurately because of the effort it would take/inefficiency it would create. I think he even commented that if anyone would be crazy enough to implement it accurately, it would be you. <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />beware does support <em>detecting</em> illegal access during OAM DMA. The way he does this (iirc - I may be hazy on the details) is as follows:<br />If interrupts are disabled, and the OAM routine follows the standard routine verbatim (true for 99% of games, but not DKL incidentally) nothing special is done, since illegal access would be impossible anyway. Otherwise (and if the user has the &quot;break on bad OAM DMA enabled in the exceptions) a special hidden access breakpoint (existing debug infrastructure) is set for reads/writes to 0000-feff. Said breakpoint expires based on a timer.<br /><br />I once suggested a slightly clusterfuckish idea to beware, which he rejected. Have a 256 place lookup table each for reads and writes which contains a function pointer for each position. These tables handle address decoding for reads and writes respectively. The index is the high byte of the address. During OAM, replace the pointers in index 0-254 with a special handler. This would be a relatively cheap way (in terms of CPU use) to handle the issue. And you really get the rest of the address decoding &quot;for free&quot; with this method, even if it would be a rewrite. Or slightly different, let the read and write handlers be function pointers, which you replace with a filter function during OAM DMA. <br /><br />I suspect this is a method you will reject as well.<br /><div class="quotetitle">byuu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />By the way, do you know what happens if you read from 0000-ff7f or ffff during an OAM DMA transfer? Does it mirror around to HRAM, or does it return the MDR (open bus)?<br /></div>Neither. All addresses in the FFxx range are still accessible. What happens outside of that differs with the Gameboy type. I haven't investigated this fully, but here's what I know from my tests:<br /><br />On DMG, if you read illegal memory, you get back the currently transferred byte. <br /><br />On GBC, things are more complicated. If you read from the same memory area as the OAM source, you get the currently transferred DMA byte, just like on DMG. (What these memory areas are, exactly, depends on the GBC's internal memory decoding and remains to be investigated, but at the very least I know that ROM and WRAM are different areas.) <br /><br />But it gets even more hairy. In some circumstances when reading from a <em>different</em> memory area than the one the transfer source is in, there are still some side effects in some cases. I've yet to figure out exactly how this happens, but it could be something like ANDing the the lower 8 address bits with the DMA counter. <br /><br />Gambatte does emulate the first aspect of the bug on GBC (getting a DMA byte when reading from the same memory area.) but not the other.<br /><br />I have not investigated whether reading during OAM DMA corrupts the transfer. I have not investigated writes at all.<br /><br />There is only one game, which is not an official Nintendo release, that relies on the inaccessibility to be implemented to at least some capacity, <a href="http://furrtek.free.fr/superconnard/" class="postlink">Super Connard</a>. If you're wondering, that translates to Super Asshole and it's only used for emulator detection to display the text &quot;fuck you, emulator.&quot; As far I know, Gambatte is the only emulator that runs this ROM uncracked. The author of the ROM does recommend you to crack the ROM as an exercise.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4548">nitro2k01</a> — Wed Dec 11, 2013 3:01 pm</p><hr />

&gt; Top = drawn with dycp (palette changes.)<br /><br />Oh, fun. I made tests like that for the SFC. A lot harder there with things like a moving DRAM refresh locking the system every scanline, variable memory timings, fast-mode accesses, and penalty cycles abound.<br /><br />But the best way I found to log this information on hardware: first write a routine that synchronizes you to the exact first cycle of a new frame when called. Then write a function that consumes exactly N cycles when called (N taken from a register parameter. Then write a loop that syncs to frame, then seeks ++N cycles, does some hardware write, then logs the results or displays them onscreen. Very easy to find exact points when various values are read and written.<br /><br />Very, very time consuming, though.<br /><br />As for your test ROM:<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8QFlfEw.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Huh, looks like I made a pretty good guess as to when to start rendering the display. Only off by one or two pixels, but the effect still works.<br /><br />&gt; I was wondering if the bsnes name was dead now. However, didn't the GB emulator use to be called bgameboy.<br /><br />Yes, but I added GBA emulation and bgameboyadvance looked ugly. Of course now you could say bnes/bsnes should be bfc/bsfc with my UI naming things by their official names.

The reference image is valid on DMG, but not GBC (off by one) I suspect that GBC takes on extra (machine) cycle to look up the RGB value for the palette or something like that. Of course, there a couple of different variables that come into play. <br /><br />And yes, so much left to document, still.<br /><br />Another thing I plan to do at some point is to make a bus capture device.

If you write a GUI for higan, you can support any methodology you like. My emulation cores also eventually appear in RetroArch, OpenEmu, Mednafen, etc.<br /></div>I'm sorry about this. Maybe To give you some background, I didn't bring these things up here simply to be flippant. It came out of actual frustration (though admittedly microfrustration) while investigating the problems you asked about. <br /><br />Here are the events that lead up to that paragraph: Firstly, I organize the ROMs in Higan in folders, one folder for official games, and one for test/development ROMs, which are located in the GB and GBC folders in the library. So I started by importing the Shantae ROM into v093. It didn't work, so I downloaded v093r07. At that point I moved it to the &quot;official games&quot; folder by habit. I started v093r07 and noticed that my library was empty. (Since I had placed everything in subfolders.) I assumed the library had been moved to a different location or something, so I dragged the ROM file onto the window to reimport it. Didn't work. (I didn't think of trying to drag and drop the purified version at that point.) I quit Higan and tried to drop the file on the .exe. Also didn't work. When I went to import the game from the import tab, I remember thinking that it was silly. Something that should be simple took so many extra clicks to get done.<br /><br />That friction, together with being easily irritated from sleep deprivation and the fact that you asked for feedback, made me think it was good idea to complain about it. If one of those three things hadn't been true, I probably wouldn't have mentioned it. I apologize for the rash way of delivering the message. I should have put it differently and explained why, or maybe not have mentioned it at all.<br /><br />I'll however still maintain that those two things I mentioned don't necessarily violate the ethos of Higan. Ie: <br />1) Allow you to browse subfolders. Not free file system browsing, but allowing the user to browse folders they have created inside the different platforms' directories.<br />2) Drag and drop of non-pure ROM files. If you're concerned that people will abuse this to bypass the library, make those actions import the file without auto-starting it. Or show an error message. Anything is better than silently doing nothing here, imo.<br /><br />If you still don't want to discuss it further, no reply to this is needed. I get it.<div class="quotetitle">byuu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Correct.<br /><br />The main point of confusion is that the official binary release is called by the emulator name instead of the GUI name. And that's because I've had about 10 GUIs now.<br /><br />Even more fun is that I refuse to be inconsistent in my emulator naming, so my GB/C emulator is also called bgb. But it's not like anyone sees the individual emulator names anymore, it's easier to just call it all higan. I am sure beware hates me even more for that though <img src="http://forums.nesdev.com/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /></div>Thanks for clarifying this. I was wondering if the bsnes name was dead now. However, didn't the GB emulator use to be called bgameboy. I might just have made that up in my head to disambiguate it from beware's emulator. But if this was the case, why did you change the name? Not that it really matters, for the aforementioned reason.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4548">nitro2k01</a> — Wed Dec 11, 2013 9:32 am</p><hr />

Ok, looking at the code, I think I see what the problem is. <br />Snippet #1 doesn't check the palette of the source pixel, so BG priority pixels overlap sprite pixels unconditionally.<br />Snippet #2 requires a BG priority pixel to *both* have sprite priority and BG priority to be considered for the palette check.<br /><br />I believe the correct solution is that a pixel is considered to have priority if one of two criteria are met:<br />1) The pixel has BG priority.<br />2) The pixel has sprite priority. This also implies an origin test for BG, so OB pixels aren't incorrectly handled. <br /><br />This gives the following code:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">      unsigned ox = sx + tx;<br />      if(ox &lt; 160) {<br />        //When LCDC.D0 (BG enable) is off, OB is always rendered above BG+Window<br />        if(status.bg_enable) {<br />          if(pixels&#91;ox&#93;.origin == Pixel::Origin::BGP || (attr &amp; 0x80 &amp;&amp; pixels&#91;ox&#93;.origin == Pixel::Origin::BG)) {<br />            if(pixels&#91;ox&#93;.palette &gt; 0) continue;<br />          }<br />        }<br />        pixels&#91;ox&#93;.color = color;<br />        pixels&#91;ox&#93;.palette = index;<br />        pixels&#91;ox&#93;.origin = Pixel::Origin::OB;<br />      }<br /></div><br />Perhaps <strong>pixels[ox].origin == Pixel::Origin::BG</strong> should be replaced with <strong>pixels[ox].origin != Pixel::Origin::OB</strong> to be more &quot;correct&quot; but assuming there are only three sources (BG, BGP and OB) the two comparisons would be logically equivalent because of the left side of the ||.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4548">nitro2k01</a> — Tue Dec 10, 2013 12:10 am</p><hr />

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/shRft9R.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0gD7oEu.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The reason that the bridge post is above Shantae's sprite is the priority bit in the BG attribute map, as you can see in BGB's excellent VRAM viewer. This also makes sense graphically, since she's walking between the posts. The priority bit is set for that tile, and the LCDC.0 is set, so clearly those tiles (except for palette 0) should overlap the sprite.<br /><br />Unless you're saying that some other part of the bridge is overlapping her sprite when you change the behavior? Screenshot?<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gpdCEcH.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qfudOKs.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I don't see how this how this would create a contradiction with Zelda OoA. The maroon hills, in the BG, don't have their priority bits set, so the sprite is on top. The ground tiles, in the window, do have their priority bits set, and the ground is drawn with palettes 1 and 2, not 0, so the ground overlaps the sprite.<br /><br />And while we're talking graphics... Considering the focus on cycle accuracy in the (B)SNES part of Higan, I'm surprised you went for a line based renderer and not a pixel based one. The program running on the GB CPU can still change various registers like SCX and SCY when a line is being drawn to the screen. (I.e. during mode 3.) At least one officially released game makes heavy used of that: Prehistorik Man which is using it in its intro to draw text using palette changes, and probably in some places in the gameplay as well. Not to mention demoscene demos, which (ab)use this a lot, for example Mental Respirator and 20Y, which use this for things like wobbly image stretching and other special effects.<br /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ulIdFLF.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/alJWP9w.png" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/UP6Vxht.gif" alt="Image" /> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Xi5w2Ui.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And another &quot;while we're at it.&quot; I had to download v093r07 since Shantae didn't work in v093 and I saw this: &quot;I'm posting a beta release of higan, in the hopes of getting some feedback on the new library system (pictured below; more info on the forums), and reports of any potential new regressions before an official release.&quot;<br /><br />Regressions? You mean apart from the new &quot;features&quot;, including not being able to import files as a command line argument (useful for dragging and dropping a ROM file over higan.exe or a shortcut to it) or the now absent ability to organize one's ROMs in folders? I do appreciate the focus on accuracy in Higan, but I think the GUI/library aspect of the program is too driven by ideology, even removing legitimate features that don't have to interfere with the purity philosophy of the library. And just to state the obvious, you know my opinion on cross-loading GB and GBC files.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4548">nitro2k01</a> — Mon Dec 09, 2013 11:18 pm</p><hr />
