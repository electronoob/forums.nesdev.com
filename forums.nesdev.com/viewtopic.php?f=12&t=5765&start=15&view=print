<br />But the main thing is that it is absurd to have to load 64kB of data to play even a sound effect.  Other than the general-purpose RAM, there's probably only a few bytes real difference between a lot of SPC files.

<br />Which is why SPC sets are distributed in a solid archive such as .rar or .7z: compression recognizes this and stores the majority of each file as references to the previous file in the set.

I still need to do hardware tests with my latest code and clean things up a bit.

<br />Where do the io port init values come from?

<br />Who the hell knows.. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> It seems to happen a lot with songs from Squaresoft games, but not with songs from e.g. Capcom or Konami games.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just an idea for the startup code... games usually have an echo buffer where the SPC stores output samples to be feed-back later to create an echo effect. Since this buffer will never by used to store code, variables or samples, it should work to place the init code here - but maybe a click will be heard on the start of the song.
<br />
<br />I'm pretty sure Squaresoft games uses $fc00-$ff00 to store variables - as I have partially reverse engineered Secret of Mana's sound engine, and the other games uses a variant of it. Secret of Mana uses $ff00-$ffff to store repeat stacks or something, so if you alter anything here it will go crazy, fetch incorrect sound data etc... so no wonder it don't work !
<br />
<br />The problem would be for SPC files which doesn't use, such as Super Castlevaia IV.
