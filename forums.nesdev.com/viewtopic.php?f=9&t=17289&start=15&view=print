There's been a lot of stuff leaked over the years (ex. several versions/revisions of the SNES developers manual, all from different years), but not an official schematic or operating spec datasheet.  There would be no reason for Nintendo to ever give this out (to developers), as official cartridges were always handled by them.  There are some general block flow diagrams in the official manual, but those are for understanding how the ICs/pieces work together and what busses are for what, not electrical specifications.  So, I too am going to on out on a limb stating that guy is full of BS.<br /><br />It's funny, this exact type of attitude/approach (people hiding behind lies, and getting very aggressive if someone questions their products) also used to happen in the early 90s during the SNES copier days.  Everyone in the &quot;scene&quot; (esp. hardware-wise) was aggressive about protecting whatever it was they were selling, because otherwise it could cost them money.  Different copier vendors (distributors, often Chinese) would try to slander the other with false claims, like &quot;blah blah copier can actually fry your console!&quot; and so on.  Most users buying copiers didn't know truth from lies, so it became a stupid &quot;sub-scene&quot; battle.  I see something similar in fashion happening here, where people selling repro carts aren't complying with proper voltages and aggressively justifying their stance by saying &quot;well it works, so what's the problem?&quot; followed by any other lie they can come up with else they risk their products not selling.<br /><br />It's so much easier to just be truthful and then start releasing new versions that have level shifters in place, you know?  &quot;The old versions should work, but if you're really worried, I will replace the product with the newer version with level shifters, just send me the old ones and I'll send you the updated model&quot; would be wise, and set a good precedent too.  Customers like that.
