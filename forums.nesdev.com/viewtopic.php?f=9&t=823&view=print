		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Some NES carts require a properly functioning lockout chip in order to run, such as the NWC cart, while unlicensed carts have problems with NES systems that include counter measures against lockout chip defeaters.  Hence while permenantly disabling your lockout chip is the easiest mod, it actually prevents certain games from running correctly.  Wouldn't a better mod be to remove the lockout chip defeater protection, as opposed to permenantly disabling the lockout chip?  This way all unlicensed games run without any problems, and games that require a functioning lockout chip also run without any problems.
<br />
<br />How many variations are there of the NES lockout circuitry?  Are there circuit diagrams and pictures of each variation on the net?  Do all Famicom-to-NES cart adapters include a cart-side lockout chip or at least a dongle for attaching a NES cart as a lockout chip donor?  If so, then such a "better mod" would in a sense be an optimal mod, as it won't prevent playing Famicom games either.

<br />No unlicensed cartridge I have tried fails to work in my lockout-chip less Famicom AV, and that includes boards from American Video Entertainment/S.E.I., Tengen, Color Dreams/Bunch Games/Wisdom Tree and Camerica/Codemasters (including a switchless Aladdin Deck Enhancer.)  
<br />
<br />(I haven't tried and don't own any of the truly rare carts from Active Enterprises, Panesian or Caltron/Myriad.)  
<br />
<br />If you are among the lucky few who possess any of these rare games, I'm sure you will can afford an early toaster.
<br />
<br />But according to the schematic, why not cut the reset pin of the console lockout chip?  That way, even if the game doesn't work with the lockout chip, the lockout chip cannot negatively affect the running of the game by toggling the reset line once per second.

<br />I disconnected pin 4 on my lockoput chip to play foreign games and such and my NWC cart works absolutely fine.

<br />
<br />What's unsensible about it? All consoles had lockout chips installed in them, so there's no reason why a game can't take advantage of that.
<br />
<br />If Nintendo REALLY wanted to take advantage of the lockout chip, they could have hooked up the lockout chips in the CARTRIDGES to the ROM enable lines, effectively rendering them nonfunctional in any third-party (or de-chipped) consoles. It would, however, have made it impossible to release the toploader without the CIC.
<br />
<br />As I recall, several SNES games would not work unless they detected a working CIC within the console, and the same was true of some N64 games as well.

My guess is that the reset line is used to define an initial state.
<br />
<br />I didn't mean to imply that it's unsensible regarding security, I don't think it has anything to do with security. NWC carts at the time were certainly kept under tight watch and it's not like your average NWC theif would be a FC gamer.
<br />
<br />BTW, like the NES, SNES (and SFC) and require a CIC to even come out of reset. N64 on the other hand I don't think implements a reset-like mechanism, I think there are two levels of SW protection, one common to all CIC, and the eight or so bootcodes games are developed for.

<br />
<br />It was used to reset the hardware on the cart.  Sure, you could do it with another reset generator of some form, but that would cost money. Using the lockout chip's already existing reset function saved them money and parts and all that.... and that is the mark of a good engineer.  Being able to extract as much functionality out of the fewest parts is a fun little challenge and the name of the game. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
