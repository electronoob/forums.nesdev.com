You should look and see if any I/O lines are broken, or maybe your cart connector/game is dirty. If any I/O lines are broken, that's probably the answer. Many other broken parts would cause this problem. Obviously, one of the above is most likely the cause of this...
<br />
<br />Also, this should've probably been in the hardware section of the forum, but that's okay. Just post about this kind of stuff there next time.

A really badly put together nasty homebrew peice of crap. Like the cart that you can stick a famicom game in, and you'll be able to play famicom games on your nes. It's very ugly. But that has nothing to do with anything, so... I'm not sure what kind of games would damage the board. That's like a NES virus! hahaha! sorry.

<br />Okay, just so you know, I don't laugh at you. Because I know it is very hard to speak another language that you aren't too familiar with. But that is very incorrect english grammer. I am from the United States. Soy de los Estados Unidos. And the question is "Where ARE you from?" Are you wondering the meaning of dumb? Dumb - Another word for stupid (estupido). Is that what you were asking? I wasn't too sure about what you mean. Here is the way you say what you were trying to say:
<br />
<br />And another thing, Celius. Where are you from? USA?
<br />And finally, what is the meaning of dumb questions?
<br />
<br />Dumb in spanish means vacio, and dumb is like empty for me.
<br />What is the meaning of dumb?
<br />
<br />I think that's what you were trying to say. Sorry, if I was way off.
<br />
<br />Edit: Another meaning for dumb is unintelligent, or (no intelligente) And dumb question is like Not a very intelligent question(no muy intelligente pregunta).

<br />A "dumb question" is a question whose answer all people in the discussion should already know. But here, we prefer the traditional meaning of "dumb" (that is, not speaking), and the only dumb question is the one that you don't ask.

<br />Hey, that is not what I said... O.o
<br />"lda #0 sta $2001" will disable all rendering and will not produce any flickering effect. You could do it like this if you wanted a "flashing" effect, like a thunder or something. You'd disable rendering and have $2006 point to a bright color in the palette every other frame to have the screen "flash" between your regular game screen and white, for example.
<br />
<br />The thing with sprites is different. You alternate between rendering and not rendering <strong>only a group of sprites</strong> (the ones that make up the player), not the whole screen! For this there is no "disable rendering of main character" flag, you'll have to manually place the character's sprites off-screen, so it looks like it's not there. Do that alternatingly and the sprite will flicker.

<br />
<br />I don't know how many frames SMB uses for a good flickering effect. You could use a feature in Nintendulator and some other emulators that lets you advance frame by frame, and then you can count the frames where mario shows and when he doesn't. You should check some other games too.
