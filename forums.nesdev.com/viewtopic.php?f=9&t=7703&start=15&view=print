I'm assuming it'll fix KFH too.<br /><br />You know, powerpak.zip contains "loopy's readme.txt" or something, so I assumed I had the latest loopy mappers. I guess that's a little misleading. o_O<br /><br />Alright, so the next problem is my television's overscan. The topmost item in the file listing is offscreen, and I can barely see the red arrow cursor. I might be able to fix that myself though, if I can RE the firmware.</div>
<br />
<br />That's normal. The file listing uses the entire name table. When scrolling a long list it isn't an issue. At the root of the card where you don't have the ..\ it might be a bit annoying.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I still think it'd be a rather simple fix to have the Y scrolling nudged up a bit when you first enter a folder. Definitely however, it'd be nice if the position of the text were moved to the right one space, because my cursor is completely hidden when it reaches the corners of my screen.
<br />
<br />The firmware of the PowerPak seems to be inside powerpak/powerpakboot111.zip. Is that what the PowerPak physically uses (i.e., I can alter that file and see the changes on my PowerPak), or is that just a backup copy of some internal ROM on the powerpak? If I can just make an alteration to that file and fix the problems myself, I'll just do that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The boot ROM is a Flash chip inside the PowerPak, to modify it you have to reprogram that chip. However, it appears that the menu itself is not in the boot ROM (which contains routines for interfacing with the CF card and other "behind the curtains" stuff), but in one of the files that goes in the CF card, so it might actually be possible to change it. I don't know which file it is, though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Right, that's what I was thinking. Otherwise, why would it be necessary to put it on the CF card? (Then again, there's lots of unnecessary stuff that goes on the CF card, like the snes powerpak's firmware, duplicate loopy readme files, and a jpg. :\ )
<br />
<br />It might even be a fun little project to make a more graphical interface for the PowerPak, kinda like what you see on the Dreamcast and such. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

<br />Yeah, I'm all for a "PowerPak menu beautification project", so to speak. That thing is pretty ugly, and it bothers me a lot to have information cropped at the corners/edges of the screen. I can only see everything when I'm using my video capture card...

Titlesafe would be 1 row/column inwards from those edges.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, powerpakbootXXX.zip is the flashable boot ROM, it has 6502 routines for stuff like reading the CF and so on. Menus and all that stuff is on the CF in some of the .MAP files. They're simply 1K "modules" that get loaded at $400.
<br />
<br />If somebody wants to give a go at writing a better menu system I can provide some details about how all of it works (I've reverse engineered parts of it). It'd require quite a bit more reverse engineering though to figure out all the quirks of the FAT32 code, unless it was completely rewritten.
