<br />If the last two writes are outside of h-blank, then there'll be ugly glitches where you split the screen. There may also be some "shaking" if it's not properly inside h-blank.
<br />
<br />The way you delay your code depends on how you're splitting the screen; are you using MMC3? Are you using sprite 0? The absolute <em>worst case scenario</em> is that the programmer guesses how long to wait, and just adjusts until there isn't an ugly glitch in the middle of the screen anymore. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Unfortunately it seems I don't have the recording of the problem.
<br />
<br />I'm personally interested to see code for sprite 0 hit. The problem with the 'guess' way is that it requires to have the hardware, as emulators don't show glitches in this case, at least not the one that was in Lawn Mower.

Any order should do as long as you end by a final $2006/2 write.</div>
<br />What you write to $2006 is only an address when you're writing to $2006 in order to use $2007 to access PPU memory. If you're writing to $2006 to change the scrolling, then what you write isn't necessarily going to be an address.
<br />
<br />For example, to scroll the screen to the tile at $22A0, you need to write $02A0 to $2006. If you write $22A0 instead, then the screen <em>does</em> start at tile $22A0, but it'll start two pixels down, instead of at the top.
<br />
<br />$02A0 scrolls you to the tile at $22A0, but the actual address $02A0 points to the pattern table. Thus, what you write to $2006 may not always correspond exactly to what you think it logically should.
<br />
<br />Similarly, writing $12A0 will start 1 row into tile $22A0, and $32A0 will start 3 rows into $22A0. So again, when you're writing to $2006 to set the scrolling, and <em>not to access PPU memory with $2007</em>, then as far as you're concerned, you're not writing an address, you're setting a bunch of counters.
<br />
<br />Edit: The only reason I'm so vocal about seeing it this way is because everyone needs to know that the highest nybble of what you write to $2006 has an effect; you cannot just use the address for a nametable tile without subtracting $2000 first.

It was an year and many projects ago, so I have no idea what I was writing - something that I was told to in a forum thread, and that worked in all emulators. I guess if I had the hardware, I would find how to do it properly, by trial and error. But I didn't have the hardware, still don't have, and probably won't have - so it would be nice to have proper working code with all explainations how to use it without such problems, and/or emulators that show the same glitches as the HW.

<br />The shaking would be a scanline up-down wobbling.
<br />
<br />What were you splitting the screen for? You weren't scrolling the top half, were you? I saw your code snippet in the other thread, it looked like it should work, so I'm thinking it could be a problem somewhere else in the code. Without seeing the rest of your code, the rom, or a video or anything, I can't do much to help. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />Finally, I know the 2006/5/5/6 trick works, I've done it myself in a failed homebrew attempt, and I saw it work (scrolling and all) on a PowerPak.

<br />
<br />I doubt that the problem was somewhere else, because vertical scroll worked in all emulators. It didn't work on the hardware only, and was removed.
<br />
<br />The <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/files/nes/lawn_mower.zip" class="postlink">ROM</a> and <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/files/src/lawn_mower_src.zip" class="postlink">source code</a> are available for an year now. It is not hidden. I lost the video, as I said two posts ago.
<br />
<br />Still, no need to solve this particular problem. I'm not going to change a game that was released long ago. I would like to have a working solution in case I'd need it in the future.

You just take the adress, AND it with $fff, and OR it with the Y fine scroll, and there you are.

<br />Of course you can !
<br />It's just it will affect the fine scroll.
