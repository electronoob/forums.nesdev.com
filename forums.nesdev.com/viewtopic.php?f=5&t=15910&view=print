I don't know what to look for, but I'd start by seeing whether I could get my hands on the service manual for the TV.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If it is a capacitor problem it only involves one or two high voltage capacitors that are on B+ (usually +140V) and Video Supply (usually +200V). Service manual will list the exact voltages if you can find it, and when you do, I'd like to take a look also.<br />Low filament voltage can have such effect too, acceleration voltage (the thing you adjusted on the flyback) needs to be boosted to gain brightness, but sooner or later you reach cutoff limit and guns don't get switched off at low/no signal levels (reason you see the retrace lines).<br />If all those voltages check out then the tube is EOL. You can do a trick that boosts filament voltage (more heat, more electrons, more brightness) but it will only postpone the inevitable a bit. Flyback itself might be bad too, if anode voltage drops so will brightness but you cannot really measure the anode voltage (15...28kV, depending on tube size).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Retrace lines are invisible because they occur during the horizontal and vertical <em>blanking</em> periods of the video signal. During both horizontal and vertical blanking, the voltage is set to the blanking level, which is below the black level (outside of Japan at least), and this is done to make sure the gun does not output during retrace.<br /><br />Modern TVs may manually turn off the gun during retrace, but &quot;officially&quot;, it's the video signal that's supposed to turn off the gun during the retrace.<br /><br />I've seen a TV before which has these lines when you're sitting on the blank input screen with no signal, but the lines disappear once an input signal actually appears. Do you still see these lines when you have a device plugged into the TV and turned on?

Those were intended to upset consumer-grade VCRs, which might encounter tracking problems when the white lines are introduced.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Fisher wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Interesting.<br />But it seems to not be the case since this picture was taken with no active video source.<br />I strongly need to take my time and disassemble it.<br />Maybe I can at least figure the correct model number.</div><br /><br />It does look to me like your Screen /G2 control is too high. If there are bias controls for the individual guns, you can try turning those up after turning down the screen control on the flyback to counter the crushed dark colors that you'd get from turning down screen.
