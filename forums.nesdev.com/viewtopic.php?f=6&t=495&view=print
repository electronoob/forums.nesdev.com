		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been working on my side-scroller now for awhile and I have come to the point where I want to start adding sfx and music. The problem is, I'm not sure how to go about it. MCK is to slow for a game, NT2 won't run correctly on my machine. I would write my own playback code if I knew where to start.
<br />
<br />So what's a viable option for music and sound fx for an actual game? How would I go about writing my own playback stuff (doesn't need DMC support beacuse my game runs on a Mapper #0 cart and I want to save memory).
<br />
<br />Any input would be greatly appreciated.

I know someone who has ported NT2 to win32, surprisingly.   I just tested it the other day and it seems to work fine natively.  It looks and runs the same as it used to.  It'll be on the NT2 site once he has a version ready.  I could ask him to pass you a test copy if you want.

<br />NT2 is pretty effecient with it's RAM and CPU use.  The main thing to watch out for though is CPU usage spikes depending on what plays on the first line of a new pattern.  Sound effect support can be added pretty easily, I've done it probably the same way Matrixz did in NeSnake 2.  Which was changing the sound register writes in NT2's code to write to RAM, then you can overwrite it if you want to play sfx.
<br />
<br />There's another tracker here also:

<br />It's new, I haven't taken the time to test it's code yet.  If you do, let me know how it looks for game usage.

<br />
<br />I'm looking at the play back source code. You say I should replace the writes to the $40xx sound registers with writes to my own memory in RAM, then in my own game, I can either write whats been written by the music player, or just write my own sound effects. Sounds good but that's alittle bit of work and I was wondering if the modyfied source for that was laying around anywhere. What's the base address for all of the RAM used by the ned play back program? I'm starting to get alittle confused...
<br />
<br />Well... time to start getting used to using NT2. I've never used a tracker like this before.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just wrote my own sound code several weeks ago. It took me just one day, and it's cool because you can input all feathures you like, and avoid feature you dislike, to prevent wasting RAM and ROM. Typically, I hate the arpeggio effect, and I'll never use it in any of my musics, so I don't need a sound code who can do that. Same goes with DMC support, vibratoes, etc...
<br />
<br />To start, you first have do design yourself how to encode music, with 12 different possible notes, and many different possible timelenghts. You can fix yourself if you use the hardware decay for square channels, or if you prefer do volume in software, if you want to use the timer of the triangle channel or if you prefer time it in software, etc, etc....
<br />For the sound effects, I just duplicated all channels exept triangle, and then if the sound effect channel is active, the music channel writes are ignored.

<br />
<br />Bregalad : Maybe I'll butcher the ned player source and take the DMC stuff out. Might save some space. Since this is for a small game, it is not needed. Also, do you type out the raw hex values for your sound code you metioned or do you use some kind of editor.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I did just make my data with .db, if it is that you want to know.
<br />Actually, I dislike NT2 pretty much. It is hard to understand how it works, and it has pretty bad features (well, it has good features for the pitch, but very bad features for the volume, and I think the volume is more important), and had a lot of glitches while saving/loading song, and eventually it plays its own songs badly, and anyway it works very bad under Win2000, like every DOS programm I have that make sounds (it has pop and ckacks). Eventually, if you want to include it in a game it wastes a lot of ROM space, and it can't playback sound effects until you modify the code. Also you're forced to use CA65 if you want to change the code, except if you rewrite the whole code for another assembler, in that case you've better to write your own code.
<br />
<br />Well, to do the tempo, myself, I just had running this :
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">lda TempoCounter<br />clc<br />adc TempoValue<br />sta TempoCounter<br /></div>
<br />If the carry is set, you have to decrease all the timers for all tracks, the  tempo value can be anything but zero, and the tempo ran be ruled with a high precision with this method. It can even be modified by the main code to do effects like Battletoads (where the music sometimes fast up) or Chrono Trigger (where the music sometimes slows down). I'm pretty sure NT2 doesn't use this.

<br />At 60 Hz, what you want is 450 / 170 = 2.647 ticks per 32nd note.
<br />
<br />This pattern, which you might put out of the way in the DMC or noise channel, will give you 2.5 ticks per 32nd note or 450 / 2.5 = 180 BPM:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">--- -- F02<br />--- -- F03<br />--- -- ---<br />--- -- F02<br />--- -- ---<br />--- -- F03<br />--- -- ---<br />--- -- F02<br />--- -- ---<br />--- -- F03<br />etc.<br /></div><br />This pattern will give you 2.65625 ticks per 32nd note or 169.41 BPM:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">--- -- F02<br />--- -- F03<br />--- -- ---<br />--- -- F02<br />--- -- F03<br />--- -- ---<br />--- -- F02<br />--- -- F03<br />--- -- ---<br />etc.</div>

<br />I ended up making my own playback code. You can check out a demo here <a href="http://mbrenaman.com/soundy.zip" class="postlink">http://mbrenaman.com/soundy.zip</a>.
<br />
<br />I just have one question. Which sound emulator is the most accurate? Beacuse in some emulators, when I update the period for vibrato notes, the wave form of the note gets reset with every write to the period registers. The NSF Winamp plugin doesn't do this nor Nesten. I haven't tried Nintendulator with the sound on beacuse it runs pretty slow on my machine.

<br />I don't know which emu is most accurate, but on the real system writing to $4003/$4007 will reset the duty cycle and envelope (likewise for $400B and $400F too).

<br />The music is cool, in Bubbleman style <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> 
<br />About the period resed, I think you should avoid re-writing to $4003/$4007 during a note, exept if you want do this to have a grumble effect like Just Breed does. This cause problems for some vibratoes, where the period *should* be resetted anyway because the high 3 bits of frequencey are affected. This cause no problem on the triangle channel, however. (actually, all that stuff make me stay away of vibratoes/slides exept by sweeping hardware for now).
