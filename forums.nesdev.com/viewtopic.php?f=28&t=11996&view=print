(got new one)<br /><br />2) I read on tutorials to only use 0.97ja to complete this task. Well, This didn't work, 8 eproms were used, and only the last 2 worked.<br />2) I used version supplied with hardware, and it worked.<br /><br />Here are pictures of the final work !!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The &quot;FastROM&quot; doesn't matter at all. The PCB doesn't care about that. LoROM/HiROM matters, but if this is Street Fighter II World Warrior then they are both LoROM. <br /><br />The problem could be an error in wiring or programming of the chip. If the chip was verified maybe it's more likely a wiring error or a bad solder point.

I don't remember what it was checking for, so maybe it doesn't apply to your situation, but I wanted to let you know that this game is looking for a reason to show a black screen.<br /><br />Maybe you should try a different game.  Your ROM is probably fine, the Willem software normally verifies after programming.  Use the right jumper settings to verify it though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Does rock n roll racing require SRAM?  I dont think it does.....<br />Your cart should be a &quot;1Axx&quot;.  That's &quot;Lo Rom&quot; .  Your cart is probably 1A0N.   <br />1 = 1 Rom<br />A = &quot;Lo Rom&quot; mapping. If it's J, then it's Hi rom mapping<br />0 = no SRAM<br />N = no decoder<br /><br /> Your swap bin method is correct.   Pin 24 swaps with pin 31<br />So maybe your programming is bad.  Does your game file have a header??  Your file size should be 1024.

There shouldn't be any electrical current in the cartridge while you're working on it. Perhaps you are correct and you have damaged the CIC which would prevent the game from running. <br /><br />Perhaps the best thing you could try is to solder the original MaskROM back in place and see if it works.<br /><br />And Memblers may be correct about some kind of protection. I vaguely remember on my Game Doctor having some trouble with the game but that is not 100% certain. You could try using UCON64's -k command to crack any known protection. But I wouldn't think it should trip with an EPROM cart like this.

I looked on my disk drive to see if I had the patches I made, but strangely it's not stored with my SNES stuff, so I'm not sure where it is.  I have it on either floppy disk or CD for sure, though I've got that stuff put away.<br /><br />Test your electrical outlets, you should be able to get a tester for $3 or so at a hardware store.  If you're getting shocked, it's possible you have a bad ground connection in your home's wiring.  The same thing happened to me, on 2 different outlets in my basement.  One outlet shocked me through the PCB traces when I was soldering (ground pin wasn't connected to anything at the outlet), the other one shocked me through my guitar when I had it hooked up to my PC through an effects pedal (someone had semi-permanently installed a splitter at the outlet, but not before stupidly breaking the ground pin off of it).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If your iron is passing electricity to the soldering tip, get a different iron.   All my irons are just 2 prong power plugs (no ground pin).   Irons are just big heating elements inside-- so maybe the element is shorted to the tip.  I would suspect corruption or damage to the components -- or broken traces.  I've seen cart solder pads break at the rom pin where it's not making connection back to the edge connector.  Very hard to see sometimes.  Or maybe you have 2 pins shorted together maybe??
